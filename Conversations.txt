2014-03-16 11:52:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Checkin out this snazzy Hangouts thing
2014-03-16 11:54:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. Really nothing all that special about it, I just think it's the best implemented messaging software.
2014-03-16 11:55:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How's your morning?
2014-03-16 11:58:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nbd, just the best way to message people ever. Haha it does in actuality seem pretty snazzy. 
2014-03-16 11:59:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I slept in quite a but more than I intended too, but I'm plowing through some Poop Gen to make up for it
2014-03-16 12:00:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha there you go. I'm on the way to Little Rock listening to some Ziggy Stardust.
2014-03-16 12:01:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They had the temperature uncomfortably warm last night so I feel kinda gross now.
2014-03-16 12:05:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty great bus-ridin' music. I feel pretty gross after a 3 hr plane ride, I can't imagine a 20 hr bus ride. 
2014-03-16 12:07:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol, it's pretty bad. This is actually my first time listening to the album, but I've heard a lot of these songs already. I'm enjoying the ones that are new to me as well, though.
2014-03-16 12:09:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like the "Free Wi-Fi" claim is borderline false advertisement. It has to be the slowest internet I've ever used, which makes it pretty useless.
2014-03-16 12:11:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably to keep ppl from streaming movies. Do you have any good recreational reading with you?
2014-03-16 12:11:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can bold text!
2014-03-16 12:12:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha hooray! 🙌
2014-03-16 12:13:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was reading The Stranger on the way down. I'll probably finish it before the end of the trip.
2014-03-16 12:14:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not a book about making your hand fall asleep before jerking off, I hope?
2014-03-16 12:14:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I have heard of the book but haven't had a chance to read it yet
2014-03-16 12:14:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha no. Not quite.
2014-03-16 12:15:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's really short, but I don't know if it's something everyone needs to read.
2014-03-16 12:16:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm kinda into absurdist philosophy, which is why I'm reading it.
2014-03-16 12:27:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]have you ever read any Surrealist literature, from like the 1920s-30s?
2014-03-16 12:28:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so. Any examples?
2014-03-16 12:30:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kafka is the "high school lit" example, but I've read some French surrealist poetry and this book called "Nadja" by André Breton that you would really dig
2014-03-16 12:33:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I actually read The Metamorphosis in high school and I really liked it. I'll have to check Nadja out.
2014-03-16 12:37:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a copy I can lend you if you want. Though I think I highlighted and scribbled a little bit in it, and I'm sure you don't want my less than profound thoughts crowding the margins
2014-03-16 12:40:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That might be kinda fun actually ☺
2014-03-16 12:41:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I read most of it by the pool one summer under the influence of coronas haha. There may even be some Instagram evidence
2014-03-16 12:42:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like a good state of mind for some surrealism!
2014-03-16 12:43:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Trashy pic for a class novella haha
2014-03-16 12:43:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*classy
2014-03-16 12:46:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey, don't be calling Katherine trashy! Haha sexy pic ;)
2014-03-16 12:47:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well read and them legs. What's not to like?
2014-03-16 12:49:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I, like many social media-ites in miami, used to post pics like that more frequently until I saw this site.  http://hot-dog-legs.tumblr.com
2014-03-16 12:51:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I've actually seen that site. Love it.
2014-03-16 12:54:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]classic internets
2014-03-16 12:55:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok, i'm gonna go focus on my paper. Chatting with you is much more entertaining and not lending itself well to multi-tasking
2014-03-16 12:57:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha aw, man. Nah I dig. Good luck finishing up!
2014-03-16 13:00:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks dude, safe travels. 
2014-03-16 13:03:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]wait, quick question (thats kinda relevant to me working haha).
2014-03-16 13:04:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha ok
2014-03-16 13:04:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What reference manager did you/do you use for citations in word and keeping all your pdfs together?
2014-03-16 13:05:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I used Mendeley to organize my papers, but I never got around to integrating it with Word for citations.
2014-03-16 13:08:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]dope, I like the "free" aspect. I'm trying out a demo of Papers and it fucking sucks.
2014-03-16 13:09:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok  now  I'm going radio silent haha
2014-03-16 13:10:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha alright. Talk to you later :)
2014-03-16 22:28:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A casual friend of mine that I played frisbee in college with just called asking to stay on my couch tn cause his delayed flight made him miss the last bus out of Chicago. Now I definitely have to wipe down the couch haha
2014-03-16 22:28:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha you don't want to share the magic???
2014-03-16 22:29:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ewwww
2014-03-16 22:29:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yo I'm cutting your head off in this pic of me playing the guitar to make it my profile pic
2014-03-16 22:29:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't be sad
2014-03-16 22:30:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we never got a good shot together either
2014-03-16 22:31:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am utterly broken hearted. 
2014-03-16 22:32:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though honestly I'm making a creepy fangirl face in that pic, it needs to be cropped
2014-03-16 22:33:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh, is that what that face is? On second thought...
2014-03-16 22:35:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could have also just been daydreaming about ice cream, they're very similar expressions.
2014-03-16 22:36:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You do look ridiculously attractive in that picture though
2014-03-16 22:36:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😉 
2014-03-16 22:37:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you give me so many compliments
2014-03-16 22:37:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty nice
2014-03-16 22:39:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I can point out some really unflattering pics of you too if that'll help balance it out haha
2014-03-16 22:40:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah! That'd actually be pretty funny
2014-03-16 22:40:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe just a couple so I don't feel terrible about myself
2014-03-16 22:40:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101988080647311&set=t.7031174&type=3&theater
2014-03-16 22:40:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that one I reckon?
2014-03-16 22:42:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even that one gets some points for being adorably goofy 
2014-03-16 22:42:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]https://m.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10101984971712641&id=7031174&set=t.7031174&source=42
2014-03-16 22:42:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This one however.....
2014-03-16 22:43:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-16 22:43:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we all look goofy as hell
2014-03-16 22:43:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't even care
2014-03-16 22:43:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still love it
2014-03-16 22:43:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah it's a good goofy one
2014-03-16 22:44:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I better get mad traveling karma for putting this guy up 
2014-03-16 22:45:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word. When was the last time you've seen him?
2014-03-16 22:46:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably last May around graduation. We're not that close, but I guess he doesn't know anyone else in Chicago
2014-03-16 22:46:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't want to put pants on
2014-03-16 22:46:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's swell of ya
2014-03-16 22:46:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-16 22:46:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean...
2014-03-16 22:47:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it is YOUR place
2014-03-16 22:47:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]butttt
2014-03-16 22:47:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that might send some mixed signals
2014-03-16 22:49:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeahhh I'd rather not
2014-03-16 22:49:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whew
2014-03-16 22:49:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the Ethiopian place I went to is called Abyssinia and is permanently closed
2014-03-16 22:49:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-16 22:49:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but there's a bunch of other Ethiopian places on Broadway that are supposed to be pretty good
2014-03-16 22:52:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool, I'm sure there's some Chitown foodie review that'll give some good ones
2014-03-16 22:52:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fo sho
2014-03-16 23:37:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Got the dude all set up and now I'm gonna try to crash. Good luck studying, hope you crush that exam tomorrow!
2014-03-16 23:38:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]thanksss. Sweet dreams.
2014-03-16 23:38:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]already miss you lying on my chest by the way
2014-03-16 23:43:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thinking about that will definitely give me good dreams :)
2014-03-16 23:43:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn you're smooth
2014-03-16 23:45:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha you haven't even heard my A-game yet
2014-03-16 23:46:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a whole slew of cliches lined up
2014-03-16 23:46:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-16 23:46:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can't wait to hear them    😉 
2014-03-16 23:46:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yo last thing
2014-03-16 23:46:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let me just say you make me laugh a lot
2014-03-16 23:46:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really appreciate it
2014-03-16 23:46:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's fun
2014-03-16 23:48:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now who's giving out too many compliments?! But seriously, you make me laugh and smile a lot too. And it's refreshing for someone other than myself to appreciate my lame sense of humor 
2014-03-16 23:49:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wait... does that mean I have a lame sense of humor too?
2014-03-16 23:50:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ehhh that remains to be seen
2014-03-16 23:50:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaaaa
2014-03-16 23:50:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok now I really am crashing. Goodnight Mr. Alcorn
2014-03-16 23:51:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight Ms. Silliman!
2014-03-17 08:46:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woke up and all my dishes were done. Totally worth it now
2014-03-17 09:03:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh hell yeah! That was nice of him.
2014-03-17 09:09:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually thought about doing the dishes while I was there... but I had a hard time pulling myself away from the sexing/cuddling combo lol
2014-03-17 09:20:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's probably for the best that you didn't, then I would be  certain  you're some kind of cyborg 
2014-03-17 09:22:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm afraid I have some bad news.    😉 
2014-03-17 09:32:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh, actually I could probably get down with dat. We could then have some realllyyyy interesting conversations about the meaning of life haha
2014-03-17 09:35:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was actually wondering how you'd feel about that. I like that answer    😃
2014-03-17 09:41:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean we could still have those conversations, I'm definitely a fan of them and I feel like when I briefly mentioned the one Dallas and I had I was still a little nervous/butterfly-filled around you and wasn't articulating my thoughts clearly
2014-03-17 09:44:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I hope we get the chance to have many more of those convos
2014-03-17 09:45:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't believe how nervous we both were
2014-03-17 09:45:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]crazy, but very exciting    😃 
2014-03-17 09:46:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I said this or not, but I couldn't even eat lunch the day we went to the art museum haha
2014-03-17 09:51:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha you mentioned the butterflies but not that starvation! I was pretty glad you mentioned them though, made me feel like we were on the same page 
2014-03-17 09:52:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for sure
2014-03-17 20:08:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]heyy, lady. I'm probably gonna be working on this problem set I have due Wednesday for the rest of the night, so I won't be able to chat. I'll probably be working on it most of tomorrow too, but I think I'm gonna try to hit up a free concert on campus tomorrow night if I think I can finish up on time, so I should be able to chat a bit then. Otherwise, I probably won't have any real free time until Wednesday afternoon. Anyway, I hope you had a great day. Been thinking about you a lot!
2014-03-17 20:31:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No worries! I'm pretty thick in the grind too. Good luck with all your work, hopefully last week didn't put you back too far
2014-03-17 20:35:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]worth itttttt
2014-03-18 19:39:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey... what's up?
2014-03-18 19:53:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yo yo. Just made a bunch of burger patties for dinner at Simons 
2014-03-18 19:54:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's the problem set?
2014-03-18 19:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nom, I guess y'all are about to eat?
2014-03-18 19:54:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fucking frustrating as hell.
2014-03-18 19:54:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I'm taking a break for this concert.
2014-03-18 19:55:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have you heard of Allen Stone?
2014-03-18 19:58:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have, I saw him in Miami last winter! He's a fun show
2014-03-18 19:59:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He'll definitely yell at you for having your phone out though
2014-03-18 19:59:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha it's like his "thing"
2014-03-18 19:59:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah? There's barely anyone here so I'm an easy target.
2014-03-18 20:01:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually recently listened to his album recently and thought to myself "I bet he's fun live"... so I'm looking forward to it.
2014-03-18 20:01:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Too many recentlys in that sentence
2014-03-18 20:03:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was gonna let it go, but....
2014-03-18 20:07:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How have your past 36 hours been?
2014-03-18 20:08:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Busy, but pretty good. Got all my finals stuff done!
2014-03-18 20:10:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. When are you rolling out?
2014-03-18 20:11:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I fly home Friday morning. I'm gonna meet with Cathy tomorrow and talk about 'the future'
2014-03-18 20:13:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ohh that's exciting. Right?
2014-03-18 20:14:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I'm just still pretty unsure what that is. From my reading today, I think Pacific Oysters are the system de jour 
2014-03-18 20:15:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah? That sounds pretty cool. Geosci people will love that.
2014-03-18 20:21:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have you heard of the Bad Rabbits?
2014-03-18 20:29:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Um I don't think so, what kind of music?
2014-03-18 20:33:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Funk with the occasional prog rock influence. They're the opening act and they're killing it honestly. The whole band is dancing and having a good time. The guitarists occasionally do these synchronized dance steps like old Motown groups. It's awesome haha.
2014-03-18 20:36:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds right up my alley. Did you go by yourself?
2014-03-18 20:37:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah. A couple of my basketball teammates are here. Although I've been to plenty of shows by myself haha.
2014-03-18 20:49:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm a pretty big fan of doing that sometimes. 
2014-03-18 20:54:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]One of the best concerts I've been to was The Decembrists in Atlanta by myself. I actually typically roll solo at festivals too haha. I don't know why. I guess I just like sort of doing my own thing.
2014-03-18 21:15:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really like their 2009 album, I think I overlistened to it though haha. You definitely need a small # of the right people at festivals if anyone at all. My biggest pet peeve is waiting around for people and missing a show I really wanna see
2014-03-18 21:21:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They were doing The Hazards of Love tour when I saw them. That was an awesome album/show. And agreed 100% about the pet peeve!
2014-03-18 21:24:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I can have a low tolerance for excessive complaining/whining I guess, and some people I've been to Bonarroo  or other rly hot festivals with just can't quite hang
2014-03-18 21:27:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Bonnaroo is something I still need to do, but it does sound like it has the potential to be miserable. But I know a dude whose been like six times so I guess it can't be too bad.
2014-03-18 21:28:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made a marguerita pie for dinner
2014-03-18 21:28:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's in that? I've never heard of it.
2014-03-18 21:30:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lime juice filling, salted pretzel crust, and tequila sweet cream 
2014-03-18 21:31:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is that like Key Lime pie?
2014-03-18 21:32:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The filling is a little more custardy, but yeah pretty similar. Simon  really  likes margaritas 
2014-03-18 21:34:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. Sounds pretty good. Still waiting for those flaws to come out.
2014-03-18 21:34:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess your handwriting IS pretty bad.
2014-03-18 21:42:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh hell yeah! The dude on the keys is using a talk box.
2014-03-18 22:14:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Such a music nerd, I love it
2014-03-18 22:30:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-03-18 23:01:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright stud, I'm crashing soon. Enjoy the rest of the concert, I might just put some Allen Stone on to fall asleep to
2014-03-18 23:03:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Actually just got back. Allen Stone covered  "Is This Love", which got me wanting to listen to the original... feel free to join me if you like... goodnight    😃 
2014-03-18 23:08:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I forgot how goofy he was when he sings! 
2014-03-18 23:09:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean? Like his face?
2014-03-18 23:09:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah watching a video of him singing, his expressions are pretty awesome 
2014-03-18 23:10:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are we talking about Allen Stone?
2014-03-18 23:11:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://youtu.be/Bb07cO7lX_0
2014-03-18 23:11:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The dude was super grateful even though the crowd was really small
2014-03-18 23:12:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]scored a lot of points with me for that
2014-03-18 23:12:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he does do some weird shit with his mouth
2014-03-18 23:12:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but he can wail
2014-03-18 23:12:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so whatever works
2014-03-18 23:13:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'm not judging, I liked him a lot too. I always appreciate when an artist makes an effort to interact with the crowd beyond the typical "What's up, Dallas!"
2014-03-18 23:14:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for sure. I like this version better than the one he did tonight.
2014-03-18 23:14:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's a little closer to the original
2014-03-18 23:21:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Its a good tune to be the last thing to listen to before bed fo sho. Goodnight, dont work too hard
2014-03-18 23:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We'll see how that goes. Sweet dreams.
2014-03-19 14:53:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Got some positive feedback on my oyster ideas. Looks like I'll possible be going to Washington and the Duke Marine Lab for a bit this summer
2014-03-19 15:18:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Damn! Look at you! Sounds like you got a fun/busy summer coming up. You think you'd have any free time at the Duke Lab for visits? Assuming you haven't realized what a schmuck I am by that point.
2014-03-19 15:19:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And congrats, by the way. I am really excited/happy for you. You're an amazing lady!
2014-03-19 15:23:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha the Duke thing is veryyy up in the air at this point, I need to email a bunch of people and slog through some NOAA data over the next couple of weeks. But obviously if I'm in that part of the country at all I can engineer some visits
2014-03-19 15:24:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And thank you, it feels so good to have at least some sort of idea of what I'm doing
2014-03-19 15:27:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's awesome. It definitely sounds like you have your shit together!
2014-03-19 15:28:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mehhh lol. Workin on it. Hows your day going?
2014-03-19 15:30:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not bad. I've had this lingering feeling of stress this whole week that I'm hoping will fade tomorrow after my exam.
2014-03-19 15:35:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hopefully having something to look forward to over the weekend can help you get through :)
2014-03-19 15:41:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh for sure. My brain gets a little shot of dopamine every time I think about you, which has been pretty frequent!
2014-03-19 16:23:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good ol' dopamine. Where do you live in Dallas? You said somewhere in the suburbs?
2014-03-19 16:57:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]North Dallas. Across the street from Plano.
2014-03-19 16:57:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Far North Dallas I guess technically.
2014-03-19 16:58:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol I just got a picture text of a baby what looks like moments after birth.
2014-03-19 16:59:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I occasionally get texts from people I don't know to my T-Mobile number
2014-03-19 17:00:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The baby's name is Makayla and she's 7 lb. 8 oz.
2014-03-19 17:00:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha
2014-03-19 17:01:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thats pretty weird haha. Did you respond? You should send them a picture of congratulatory balloons
2014-03-19 17:02:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol I was thinking about saying congratulations and that I don't know them.
2014-03-19 17:04:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Kinda fun that I got to share in their happiness, though!
2014-03-19 17:07:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess there are much worse birth related pictures you could accidentally receive...
2014-03-19 17:08:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh lawdy
2014-03-19 17:11:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You got anything fun planned for the evening?
2014-03-19 17:17:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah. About to go for a run and then maybe just getting stoned and listening to music haha.
2014-03-19 17:19:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Sounds like a good way to unwind.
2014-03-19 18:59:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The last 2 pieces of bacon :(
2014-03-19 19:05:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha aw, I hope they're as good as the first
2014-03-19 19:08:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'd be pretty hard to beat post-sex bacon
2014-03-19 19:09:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha, man what an awesome morning that was
2014-03-19 19:13:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Easily in my the top ten
2014-03-19 19:13:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn someone's got me bit, eh?
2014-03-19 19:14:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Guess that's something to strive for
2014-03-19 19:15:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was including some Christmas mornings in there too, getting a computer was  prettyyyy dope
2014-03-19 19:16:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh I dig... still something to shoot for I suppose. The computer you're using now?
2014-03-19 19:18:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was a present to myself, but my first laptop was a Xmas/bday combo
2014-03-19 19:19:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-03-19 19:20:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I remember being pretty amped about getting a PS2 for Christmas
2014-03-19 19:21:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That was probably a top ten morning, lol
2014-03-19 19:21:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like Christmas mornings have an unfair advantage, though
2014-03-19 19:21:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for rankings
2014-03-19 19:21:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they fucking rule if you love Christmas
2014-03-19 19:21:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they should have their own separate list
2014-03-19 19:22:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a good point 
2014-03-19 19:26:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you know Holy Ghost?
2014-03-19 19:26:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so
2014-03-19 19:27:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see they are signed to DFA Records
2014-03-19 19:27:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is James Murphy's label
2014-03-19 19:36:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] They're fun, kinda funky.
2014-03-19 19:37:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I just listened to "Dumb Disco Ideas", reminded me a bit of LCD Soundsystem, which I guess isn't all that surprising
2014-03-19 19:38:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They can be pretty synth heavy at times
2014-03-19 19:41:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Am I distracting you from studying?
2014-03-19 19:41:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah
2014-03-19 19:41:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I don't want to be any  more of a bad influence on you working haha 
2014-03-19 19:41:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-19 19:41:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it honestly is relaxing me and helping me work I think
2014-03-19 19:42:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll let you know if it's too distracting
2014-03-19 19:42:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K good
2014-03-19 19:43:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Digging that Chagall in your profile pic
2014-03-19 19:44:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks, I love stain glass windows in general. 
2014-03-19 19:45:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those are at the Art Institute
2014-03-19 19:45:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, they're rad. I love that room at the Art Institute.
2014-03-19 19:45:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]More people should have stained glass in their houses
2014-03-19 19:46:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Agreed. Definitely a life goal
2014-03-19 19:46:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah?
2014-03-19 19:46:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Anything in particular?
2014-03-19 19:47:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably something abstract with different shapes and not too big
2014-03-19 19:47:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Triangles maybe
2014-03-19 19:47:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I was expecting something like a giant coral reef, lol
2014-03-19 19:48:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which would be pretty fucking sick
2014-03-19 19:48:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]actually I'm claiming that
2014-03-19 19:48:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha damn I didn't think of that!
2014-03-19 19:50:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could have a giant aquarium on one wall and a coral reef window on the other. 
2014-03-19 19:50:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just need to win the lottery 
2014-03-19 19:50:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ballin'
2014-03-19 19:50:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha, I was thinking Scientist Cribs?
2014-03-19 19:51:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yess
2014-03-19 19:51:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That actually has the potential to be hilarious
2014-03-19 19:51:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]actually every scientist's house I've been to is awesome, though
2014-03-19 19:51:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not necessarily huge or anything
2014-03-19 19:51:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but just
2014-03-19 19:51:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn this is a nice spot
2014-03-19 19:53:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mark Westneat has a really pleasant house. 
2014-03-19 19:53:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I handed out candy there this Halloween with ppl
2014-03-19 19:53:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah! Exactly
2014-03-19 19:53:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, did you?
2014-03-19 19:53:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did that one year too
2014-03-19 19:53:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That was a lot of fun.
2014-03-19 19:54:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I kinda loved it. That's probably the first time I've handed out candy ever 
2014-03-19 19:54:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wore a Star Trek shirt lol
2014-03-19 19:54:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha, that was your costume?
2014-03-19 19:55:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess your Ms. Frizzle wasn't appropriate, huh?
2014-03-19 19:55:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I tried to make it Space Ms. Frizzle, but the dress still faintly smelled of alcohol 
2014-03-19 19:56:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-19 19:56:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh yeah! I forgot to ask you about some of those stories Shane was telling.
2014-03-19 19:56:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-19 20:00:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh boy. Its not my least sloppy night to say the least. I got quite drunk, and tried to climb in Kate Criswells trunk, then Sebastien tried to make out with me and I ran away and ended up talking to this lesbian friend of Daniela's for like 45 minutes and she kissed me.
2014-03-19 20:00:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha oh mannn
2014-03-19 20:01:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like you were properly initiated into the Darwinian Halloween tradition
2014-03-19 20:01:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man that shit is undeniably rowdy
2014-03-19 20:01:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I almost couldn't leave my house the next day I was so embarrassed. I had like just met these ppl
2014-03-19 20:01:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha that's how you form those tight bonds!
2014-03-19 20:01:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh man
2014-03-19 20:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's so great
2014-03-19 20:03:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't usually kiss strangers, certainly not in front of everyone. And I've been trying to sort of fix that reputation since, but the pants-splitting night in Austin didn't help lol
2014-03-19 20:04:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not recalling this
2014-03-19 20:04:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What??? You were there, dancing relatively close to me 
2014-03-19 20:05:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At Barbarellas I split my pants down the middle and had to wrap my jacket around my waist ala 90s
2014-03-19 20:05:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then kept dancing
2014-03-19 20:05:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Okay, I vaguely recall the jacket thing
2014-03-19 20:05:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This was the last night, right?
2014-03-19 20:06:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah. I tried to be sneaky about it and maybe I was actually successful
2014-03-19 20:06:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, I don't know
2014-03-19 20:07:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My recollection of that night is like intense bursts
2014-03-19 20:07:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I really drank that much
2014-03-19 20:09:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have DANCING --> DANCING WITH YOU --> YOU KISSING ME ON THE CHEEK --> DANCING WITH YOU --> MAKING OUT --> YOU DANCING ALL CRAZY WITH OTHER GUY(S?) --> ME PICKING UP YOUR PHONE --> YOU DISAPPEARING --> ME AND DANIELA GOING ABSOLUTELY BONKERS WHEN "DATE WITH THE NIGHT" COMES ON --> CIGARETTE WITH BRETT, WHERE I FIRST BECAME AWARE YOU GUYS HAD SOME KIND OF HISTORY --> FIN
2014-03-19 20:09:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the caps are because that's how I see it in my head
2014-03-19 20:09:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-19 20:10:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I danced pretty intensely with a few gay men there lol
2014-03-19 20:11:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They were getting down
2014-03-19 20:12:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely remember dancing with you and kissing a little, but I don't quite remember fully making out. 
2014-03-19 20:12:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha perhaps overstated it
2014-03-19 20:12:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there was tongue at some point
2014-03-19 20:12:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I said, intense flashes
2014-03-19 20:13:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]details are hazy
2014-03-19 20:13:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I got the general plot down, though
2014-03-19 20:13:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-19 20:15:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds about right to me. I didn't know you talked to Brett after
2014-03-19 20:15:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's honestly part of the fucking reason I had no idea
2014-03-19 20:16:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I forget the exact convo
2014-03-19 20:16:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Somehow it got to me saying we kissed
2014-03-19 20:16:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't remember
2014-03-19 20:16:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he said y'all had made out before
2014-03-19 20:16:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that you weren't his type
2014-03-19 20:17:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I apologized
2014-03-19 20:17:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but then he said something like it was completely cool
2014-03-19 20:17:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I forget how the exact convo went
2014-03-19 20:17:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but based on that convo I had established in my head that there was nothing I needed to worry about
2014-03-19 20:18:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah...
2014-03-19 20:18:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the exact quote was like "she's sexy as hell, but not my type"
2014-03-19 20:18:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]something like that
2014-03-19 20:18:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where I was like "huh?"
2014-03-19 20:18:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-19 20:18:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]anyway
2014-03-19 20:18:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is drunken convo
2014-03-19 20:18:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd appreciate it if you didn't divulge you have this info if y'all talk about stuff
2014-03-19 20:20:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No no I won't, I'm not too worried about it I think he was just surprised when I first told him.
2014-03-19 20:21:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel less good about the situation, honestly
2014-03-19 20:21:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It got kinda uncomfortable
2014-03-19 20:21:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-03-19 20:21:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think we're on good terms right now
2014-03-19 20:21:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](me and Brett)
2014-03-19 20:23:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]From what I know of Brett, he's very much a "bros before ho's" guy, I'm sure he'll be fine with you. And I'm very much not his type and vice versa, that's why we only 
2014-03-19 20:24:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hung out for like a month
2014-03-19 20:25:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Well I hope we can be good again. He's always been a really good guy to me.
2014-03-19 20:25:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the fact that we're not really able to talk it out is part of the problem too.
2014-03-19 20:26:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like who knows when I'll see him again.
2014-03-19 20:26:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably fall at the earliest.
2014-03-19 20:27:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's life.
2014-03-19 20:27:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely not my style to get involved in this kind of situation, though. I'm not really used to it.
2014-03-19 20:31:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think it's really a situation at all, I think he was a little weirded out by it but by the time he gets back next week he'll be over it. 
2014-03-19 20:33:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I am sorry I got you involved in it
2014-03-19 20:33:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all good. I don't regret anything.
2014-03-19 20:33:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would've like to talked to him about it a bit beforehand knowing what I know now.
2014-03-19 20:34:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I think things turned out pretty amazingly.
2014-03-19 20:34:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]amazing?
2014-03-19 20:34:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]amazingly
2014-03-19 20:34:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]modifying turned out
2014-03-19 20:34:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-03-19 20:34:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have no idea
2014-03-19 20:34:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]amazing
2014-03-19 20:35:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty amazing
2014-03-19 20:35:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-19 20:35:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm fucking losing it
2014-03-19 20:35:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I think either works, but one indicates the process of turning out and one is the end product
2014-03-19 20:35:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-03-19 20:35:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Let's just acknowledge it's a bad sentence.
2014-03-19 20:36:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might not even be a sentence 
2014-03-19 20:36:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let's acknowledge it's a bad combination of words
2014-03-19 20:36:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-03-19 20:44:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you seen Stuck in Love? Jennifer Connelly movie about a bunch of writers 
2014-03-19 20:45:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have not
2014-03-19 20:46:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna give it a try, sounds pretty indie cliche
2014-03-19 20:47:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word. So a bunch of sad people?
2014-03-19 20:48:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sad and angsty, with a fair amount of folksy music 
2014-03-19 20:48:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds about right
2014-03-19 20:49:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Opening with Edward Sharpe obvs
2014-03-19 20:49:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did we do that one at Music Night?
2014-03-19 20:49:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so.
2014-03-19 20:49:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We used to do it. It's pretty fun.
2014-03-19 20:50:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we did it. It was a song I actually knew the words enough to sing aloud 
2014-03-19 20:51:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha oh alright. Yeah I remember people doing the talking part now.
2014-03-19 20:51:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It got kinda goofy at that point.
2014-03-19 21:37:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In this movie the kids favorite book is "It" too for some of the same reasons it's one of mine. I feel oddly justified 
2014-03-19 21:45:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, that's pretty wild, you had fairly developed thoughts on it
2014-03-19 22:11:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anddd now its ending with the exact same Edward Sharpe song...
2014-03-19 22:11:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]prolly symbolic
2014-03-19 22:12:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tryin too hard
2014-03-19 22:12:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-19 22:12:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what'd you think then
2014-03-19 22:14:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh it made me tear up a couple times, it was definitely shameless with the plot mechanics. 
2014-03-19 22:14:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was pretty decent
2014-03-19 22:14:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, word
2014-03-19 22:14:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tear up because sad or happy
2014-03-19 22:14:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know your cry triggers
2014-03-19 22:16:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Both, but there were a lot of tragic parts. When it comes to movies and music, it doesn't usually take much. 
2014-03-19 22:16:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kinda embarrassing haha
2014-03-19 22:16:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How so with music?
2014-03-19 22:16:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You seem to feel stuff pretty deeply!
2014-03-19 22:17:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I guess that applies to fear too.
2014-03-19 22:17:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hate that I can't use "cute" with you
2014-03-19 22:17:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but whatever the equivalent to that is
2014-03-19 22:17:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what your scare jumps were
2014-03-19 22:19:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I don't know if thats quite the same thing, I'm just jumpy and have read too many horror stories
2014-03-19 22:19:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah... it just made me think of it really
2014-03-19 22:19:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But some music can definitely be very emotional
2014-03-19 22:20:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I can't imagine crying to a song
2014-03-19 22:20:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't really cry
2014-03-19 22:20:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]songs like "All My Friends" and "Chicago" make me feel a lot of emotion I guess
2014-03-19 22:20:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but nothing that would ever make me cry I don't think
2014-03-19 22:21:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm a big baby what can I say
2014-03-19 22:21:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, aw
2014-03-19 22:21:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Poignant cello songs reallyyyy get me
2014-03-19 22:21:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no kidding
2014-03-19 22:22:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so lyrics aren't even necessary?
2014-03-19 22:23:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've possibly gotten emotional more over songs without lyrics. But there are those certain songs with lyrics that too perfectly describe what you're feeling
2014-03-19 22:24:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. The no lyrics thing is really interesting to me.
2014-03-19 22:24:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]From like a neurological perspective
2014-03-19 22:24:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And psychological perspective too
2014-03-19 22:24:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like what sounds and emotions have crossed wires in your brain?
2014-03-19 22:24:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are they happy emotions?
2014-03-19 22:24:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sad?
2014-03-19 22:25:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really interesting.
2014-03-19 22:25:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]were you born that way?
2014-03-19 22:25:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did certain experiences make it that way?
2014-03-19 22:25:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]those kinds of questions
2014-03-19 22:25:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]music and the brain are rad, man!
2014-03-19 22:26:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I absolutely feel you on that. My brother almost wanted to go into cognitive science for that exact reason
2014-03-19 22:27:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I started reading into books and articles about the hypotheses on the evolution of music in human nature and culture
2014-03-19 22:28:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like my junior year, but I got too busy to really look into it as much as I'd like. 
2014-03-19 22:28:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, music is a pretty weird thing
2014-03-19 22:28:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we just really like patterns I guess
2014-03-19 22:28:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm all about patterns
2014-03-19 22:28:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-19 22:29:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm loling over here
2014-03-19 22:29:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But then you look at free jazz! Like what the hell is up with that!
2014-03-19 22:29:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]True...
2014-03-19 22:30:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]could be playing off our expectations of patterns?
2014-03-19 22:30:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like the breaking of patterns makes it novel and interesting?
2014-03-19 22:30:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and there's still harmony
2014-03-19 22:30:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is kind of a pattern I guess
2014-03-19 22:30:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in that these sounds sound nice together
2014-03-19 22:30:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-03-19 22:30:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just riffing
2014-03-19 22:32:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The concept of harmony is pretty interesting though in itself. But yeah I guess intentional breaking of a pattern or standard is still stemming from a very intense understanding of that pattern
2014-03-19 22:33:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really wanted to minor in music at Auburn so I could get into some jazz
2014-03-19 22:34:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have enough theory to jam with people on basic stuff
2014-03-19 22:34:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like western popular music
2014-03-19 22:34:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]rock/folk/etc.
2014-03-19 22:34:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I wouldn't be able to do shit in jazz
2014-03-19 22:35:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like you really need to play with people to get good at it, though
2014-03-19 22:35:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I never really had someone in that scene to play with
2014-03-19 22:36:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, definitely requires a lot of practice, with people and like with a Cd with changes
2014-03-19 22:42:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have you ever taken DMT?
2014-03-19 22:43:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, I'm a little nervous too. But I've been around a couple friends when they did
2014-03-19 22:43:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what makes you nervous about it?
2014-03-19 22:43:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]too intense?
2014-03-19 22:44:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, it feels like cheating somehow. Like I should wait until it's natural. Have you?
2014-03-19 22:45:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean by "natural"?
2014-03-19 22:45:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I haven't.
2014-03-19 22:45:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm subscribed to /r/drugs and it pops up a lot
2014-03-19 22:45:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it has me intrigued
2014-03-19 22:47:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Isn't it usually at higher concentrations in humans during extremes stress (like death) or deep REM sleep?
2014-03-19 22:48:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-03-19 22:48:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've heard that
2014-03-19 22:48:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know the details
2014-03-19 22:49:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might be a drug urban legend, I don't know if I ever actually looked it up. 
2014-03-19 22:49:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wikipedia says one Dr. Strassman put forward the hypothesis
2014-03-19 22:49:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that there's no reliable published evidence supporting it.
2014-03-19 22:51:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Figures. Honestly if the right situation came up I probably would try it, I just like to be sure I'm really comfortable with people when I trip with them.
2014-03-19 22:51:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt
2014-03-19 23:04:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Give me an album that's important to you.
2014-03-19 23:04:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sleepy face
2014-03-19 23:04:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll give it a listen tomorrow to get into a "Katherine is coming" mood
2014-03-19 23:04:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw
2014-03-19 23:05:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm smiling like an idiot over here at that pic
2014-03-19 23:05:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-19 23:06:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's kinda lame, but I'm hoping it inspires you to send one 
2014-03-19 23:06:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As for an album, Wye Oak's Civilian is easily one of my favorites
2014-03-19 23:07:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And important to me
2014-03-19 23:08:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll get on that
2014-03-19 23:08:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Never listened to it before
2014-03-19 23:08:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's good to listen to it all the way through in one sitting if you have time
2014-03-19 23:09:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the only way I listen to albums
2014-03-19 23:09:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that picture definitely gave me a goofy smile 
2014-03-19 23:10:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you lying on the floor?
2014-03-19 23:10:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah chillin on my couch
2014-03-19 23:11:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll be checkin out that couch soon enough 
2014-03-19 23:11:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yesss
2014-03-19 23:12:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can't wait
2014-03-19 23:12:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this whole thing is crazy
2014-03-19 23:12:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm loving every second of it yo
2014-03-19 23:13:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want it to get too crazy
2014-03-19 23:14:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And just fizzle out in a week
2014-03-19 23:14:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's honestly really good to hear
2014-03-19 23:15:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've convinced myself about 100 times you're gonna change your mind about visiting this weekend
2014-03-19 23:19:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm pretty excited, and still a tiny bit nervous too. I almost wish My spring break was in like 2 or 3 weeks from now to help spread out opportunities to see you
2014-03-19 23:20:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. But it's all good! We can talk about all that stuff later... I'm just gonna be excited about seeing you this weekend for now    😃 
2014-03-19 23:20:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Perfect.
2014-03-19 23:21:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now sleepy face is off to bed, and not setting an alarm!
2014-03-19 23:21:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, yeah!
2014-03-19 23:21:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]enjoy your rest
2014-03-19 23:21:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ace your test
2014-03-19 23:21:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Be your best
2014-03-19 23:22:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, I'll try
2014-03-19 23:22:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't be shy!
2014-03-19 23:22:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha sorry, goodnight 
2014-03-19 23:22:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha someone's getting a little loopy
2014-03-19 23:23:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet dreams... I like how natural our convos feel
2014-03-19 23:23:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nothing seems forced
2014-03-19 23:23:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-03-19 23:23:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems to roll
2014-03-19 23:23:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sorry
2014-03-19 23:23:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight!
2014-03-19 23:23:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously, I agree. Lata
2014-03-20 12:22:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just now getting out of bed. What's up #sb2k14
2014-03-20 12:23:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol damn. Can't remember the last time I stayed in bed that late. You're doing it right!
2014-03-20 12:41:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely feel like a bit like a big slug, but I'm ok with it
2014-03-20 12:47:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Now I'm trying to imagine what a big slug feels like
2014-03-20 12:49:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In this slugs case, really hungry haha
2014-03-20 12:50:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess a 13(?) hour fast will do that to ya!
2014-03-20 12:52:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh, there was a pb&j around 12:30 cause I couldn't sleep, but still no beuno
2014-03-20 12:55:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Alright, about to take this exam. I'll talk to you later.
2014-03-20 14:06:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In full on "Katherine is visiting" mode now!
2014-03-20 14:07:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd the test go??
2014-03-20 14:10:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not great. I'm pretty sure I'm done with grad school after this go around. I'm so burn out with classes.
2014-03-20 14:10:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Burnt*
2014-03-20 14:13:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I would've enjoyed doing A.I. research, but I just am really disillusioned with higher education right now.
2014-03-20 14:14:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Anyway. I'm about to hit the gym for the first time in two weeks. Might be rough.
2014-03-20 14:15:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In case you were getting red flags, I meant done with grad school once I finish my degree here.
2014-03-20 14:18:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what I figured. Don't let it get you too down, next year might have less bullshit. Or you can always work for a couple years before deciding about phd. 
2014-03-20 14:21:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks for the encouragement :)
2014-03-20 14:53:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Turns out a bunch of sex doesn't really help my squat numbers.
2014-03-20 14:56:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Annddd I lost four pounds.
2014-03-20 14:56:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha, maybe we just need to get a little more creative
2014-03-20 14:58:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I don't need a gym motivator to get on board with that.
2014-03-20 15:12:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's effing beautiful out today. The weather looks like it's gonna be kinda shitty while you're here unfortunately.
2014-03-20 15:22:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I saw that :/ it's a pretty beautiful day here too though, albeit much colder
2014-03-20 15:26:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Well I hope winter is over by the time you get back. I was just looking through my old Facebook posts and there's one from like May 25th of my first year in Chicago where I'm complaint about it being like 43 feels like 36 or something haha.
2014-03-20 15:28:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love that city, but if I was gonna live there permanently I would need to take a vacation to a warm climate at least once a month in the winter to keep my sanity.
2014-03-20 15:29:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth, I would've been better off mentally if Austin hadn't also been unseasonably freezing
2014-03-20 15:30:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. That was messed up.
2014-03-20 15:30:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhh 43 in May, that's not what I want to hear
2014-03-20 15:31:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That first winter was pretty bad, but I guess this one is even worse, so I wouldn't be surprised if it happened again.
2014-03-20 15:32:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But you'll be peacing out to the rainforest, so it's all good either way!
2014-03-20 15:54:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need to find a way to learn conversational Spanish in 2 months. I really want to travel for like 10 days after but I can't do that by myself if I don't speak any Spanish  
2014-03-20 15:58:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Better get on that haha.
2014-03-20 19:27:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to this evening?
2014-03-20 20:25:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm at an SEC alumni mixer, might be seeing Kenan Thompson depending when we leave. What are you up to?
2014-03-20 20:47:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kenan is the only reason I still occasionally watch SNL, he's great. I'm playing Skyrim at Lizs with Darcy and some ppl 
2014-03-20 20:56:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah? You play Skyrim a lot? I've actually never tried it. And I got pretty into SNL this past season.
2014-03-20 21:02:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would do binges on school breaks with my brother. We're just dicking around though while drinking scotch, but yeah maybe a littleeee nerdy.
2014-03-20 21:04:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like a good time. You're definitely nerdier than me, which is different.
2014-03-20 21:04:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Also more talented than me, which is also different.
2014-03-20 21:22:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nerdier is definitely possible, I don't know about talented
2014-03-20 21:27:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you've already locked down nerdier, lol. You already told me about the ocarina.
2014-03-20 21:31:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should've held that back for a later date -_-
2014-03-20 21:37:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nah, definitely like knowing about it now. Good to get that kind of thing out in the open early.
2014-03-20 21:49:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What time is your flight tomorrow?
2014-03-20 22:05:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I just don't want to be identified by it, ya know? But my flight is at 3:45p, gonna go to lab meeting before 
2014-03-20 22:07:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. And I'm not identifying you in any sort of one-dimensional way like that. You got all kinds of interesting things going on.
2014-03-20 22:54:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Our tastes diverge on Wye Oak
2014-03-20 22:56:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really? Too indie/abstract at points?
2014-03-20 22:57:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe too indie
2014-03-20 23:17:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aw that's ok. I guess I still need to learn your tastes
2014-03-21 00:05:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Promise at some point you'll do a relisten with me though. In case I can change your mind 
2014-03-21 00:05:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Deal, but I wouldn't get your hopes up.
2014-03-21 00:08:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha fair enough.
2014-03-21 00:09:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On my way home 
2014-03-21 00:09:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fun night?
2014-03-21 00:12:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, very chill. I was definitely 5th wheeling though as it was Darcy +boyfriend and Liz+ husband, but it was fun
2014-03-21 00:13:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I feel like it's not really fifth wheeling with people who have been together a while, though.
2014-03-21 00:15:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's kinda true.Darcy and her bf have excellent taste in liquor too, which helps
2014-03-21 00:15:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah? What were you drinking?
2014-03-21 00:17:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Laphroig Scotch, and some Hendrick's gin 
2014-03-21 00:18:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Feeling good?
2014-03-21 00:20:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'm definitely not sober, but definitely feeling good 
2014-03-21 00:21:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha good    😃 
2014-03-21 00:22:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you see Kenan?
2014-03-21 00:22:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah, we were thinking about it, but my friend who was there said it was full, so we just we just stuck around the SEC mixer and watched the tourney
2014-03-21 00:25:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm super looking forward to vegging out in front of my parents tv while I'm home (and not with you)
2014-03-21 00:25:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, yeah. I'm sure that'll feel nice after the past few months.
2014-03-21 00:27:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should give me an album that's important to you, too.
2014-03-21 00:27:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To be fair :)
2014-03-21 00:27:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You've probably listened to all the albums that are really important to me
2014-03-21 00:28:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sooo like Illinois
2014-03-21 00:28:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sound of Silver
2014-03-21 00:28:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm Wide Awake It's Morning
2014-03-21 00:28:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]De Stijl
2014-03-21 00:28:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you not listened to any of those?
2014-03-21 00:30:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've listened to all of them, but am probably least familiar with the White stripes one as an album
2014-03-21 00:31:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that one was big for me when I was like 16-17
2014-03-21 00:31:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still love it, though
2014-03-21 00:31:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The White Stripes were the first band I really loved
2014-03-21 00:31:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I saw them when I was in high school
2014-03-21 00:31:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and again in college
2014-03-21 00:32:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Muse was the first band I really loved apart from what my parents showed me
2014-03-21 00:32:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, right
2014-03-21 00:32:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's what I mean
2014-03-21 00:32:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the first band that was in it's prime during my life that I loved
2014-03-21 00:33:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]its*
2014-03-21 00:33:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I see. I feel like all those albums are a little older too
2014-03-21 00:33:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they are, but I'm a little older than you too
2014-03-21 00:34:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Barely..
2014-03-21 00:34:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A few years, right?
2014-03-21 00:34:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When's your bday?
2014-03-21 00:34:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]10/12/1987
2014-03-21 00:35:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sooo 3.5 years older
2014-03-21 00:36:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Negligible 
2014-03-21 00:36:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-21 00:36:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not when we're talking about music
2014-03-21 00:36:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]soo Sound of Silver came out in 2007
2014-03-21 00:36:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's four years before civlian
2014-03-21 00:36:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What albums in the last 2-3 years were really impactful for you
2014-03-21 00:36:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which lines up pretty nicely with that 3.5 year number
2014-03-21 00:37:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I love LCD soundsystem and am very well versed in all their music
2014-03-21 00:37:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if albums really have a big impact on me anymore
2014-03-21 00:37:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's kinda what I was getting at
2014-03-21 00:37:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I articulated it actually
2014-03-21 00:37:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think important albums typically happen to people in their late teens early 20s
2014-03-21 00:38:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like albums that end up sort of shaping your tastes
2014-03-21 00:38:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or defining your music persona
2014-03-21 00:38:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I listened to the Fiona Apple album recently
2014-03-21 00:38:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which isn't really new
2014-03-21 00:38:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2012
2014-03-21 00:38:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I really enjoyed it
2014-03-21 00:38:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's not important to me
2014-03-21 00:39:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I associate The White Stripes with high school friends
2014-03-21 00:39:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and learning guitar
2014-03-21 00:39:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and really getting into music
2014-03-21 00:39:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no band/album is ever gonna be able to make that claim now
2014-03-21 00:39:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess if I got into a new band with a person
2014-03-21 00:39:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that would work
2014-03-21 00:40:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's absolutely true, but you should be a little more open minded about the actual music of a group. And not just the associations they come with
2014-03-21 00:41:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Butttt that may just be the music major in me
2014-03-21 00:41:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess I don't follow?
2014-03-21 00:43:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, I guess most if the important albums or ''music" in my life have events or people associated with them, but some of them are just because of the impact they had on me apart from my personal extrapolations to what was currently going on in my life
2014-03-21 00:44:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They were just really fucking amazing 
2014-03-21 00:44:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the album that comes to mind for me like that is really old
2014-03-21 00:44:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-21 00:44:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In the Aeroplane Over the Sea
2014-03-21 00:44:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I listened to that for the first time in 2013
2014-03-21 00:45:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had never heard a single Netural Milk Hotel song before that
2014-03-21 00:45:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1/22/2013
2014-03-21 00:45:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.facebook.com/michael.a.alcorn/posts/10101151739751171
2014-03-21 00:45:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Man, they were actually pretty defining in early Katie's life
2014-03-21 00:45:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how did you even know they existed?
2014-03-21 00:48:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I dunno, someone introduced me to them. They are definitely a band that requires a thorough background reading to understand their music the way they intended it to be understood
2014-03-21 00:50:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No doubt. Yeah, I don't really remember ever even hearing about them until long after In the Aeroplane Over the Sea was released.
2014-03-21 00:51:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For years I listened to on Avery Island and interpreted it through my life experience and loved it, but until I found out what it was really about i don't think I really truly appreciated it
2014-03-21 00:51:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still haven't listened to that one.
2014-03-21 00:52:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I bought a ticket to see them in Columbus this summer
2014-03-21 00:52:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should probably listen to it before then, haha
2014-03-21 00:52:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Columbus, OH
2014-03-21 00:54:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You definitely should. Their addition to Pitchfork festival was the one I was most excited about
2014-03-21 00:54:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're gonna be at Coachella too
2014-03-21 00:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I told my little sister to check them out
2014-03-21 00:54:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she hasn't listened to them at all
2014-03-21 00:56:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm pretty jealous of Coachella this year, and pretty bummed that Outkast might not be coming to Chicago at all this summer
2014-03-21 00:56:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude Coachella is fucking sick this year
2014-03-21 00:56:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought for sure they'd go to Lolla but I guess not
2014-03-21 00:57:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lolla headliners piss me off sometimes
2014-03-21 00:57:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like other festivals always pick better headliners
2014-03-21 00:57:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth, at least they did last year and they are this year too. 
2014-03-21 00:57:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my first year was rad
2014-03-21 00:57:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think every other year I've gone I've been disappointed with the headliner
2014-03-21 00:57:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]s
2014-03-21 00:58:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]16 -18 yr old me just reallyyyy wants to see Outkast, and they are at literally every single other summer fest
2014-03-21 00:58:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not fair
2014-03-21 00:58:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe make a trip to see them elsewhere?
2014-03-21 00:58:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I'm doing with Neutral Milk Hotel
2014-03-21 01:00:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I think I missed my opportunity. Their only doing festivals, not individual shows and the plane/ticket prices are now all a little too pricey
2014-03-21 01:00:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should've come seen NMH at pitchfork that weekend instead
2014-03-21 01:00:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Summerfest in Milwaukee June 29
2014-03-21 01:01:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-03-21 01:01:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't even realize it was the same weekend
2014-03-21 01:01:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pitchfork isn't really my scene honestly
2014-03-21 01:01:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I've never been
2014-03-21 01:01:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the acts they bring aren't really my scene
2014-03-21 01:01:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]NMH would be the only reason I'd go
2014-03-21 01:03:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fair enough
2014-03-21 01:03:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm looking forward to hearing some new artists live I guess
2014-03-21 01:04:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I reckon it'll be good for that
2014-03-21 01:04:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna call it a night
2014-03-21 01:05:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]first day of the new internship tomorrow
2014-03-21 01:05:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]got catch that 7:30 bus
2014-03-21 01:05:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]7:41 actually
2014-03-21 01:05:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should definitely crash then
2014-03-21 01:05:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If I don't talk to you before you head out, have a safe flight
2014-03-21 01:06:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can't wait to see you
2014-03-21 01:06:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Goodnight    😃 
2014-03-21 01:06:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Night :)
2014-03-21 15:28:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We need to get some good BBQ while I'm there. I'm craving some brisket  
2014-03-21 18:03:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds good to me. I found a couple of articles suggesting places.
2014-03-21 18:52:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are there any foods or drinks you'd like me to have in stock?
2014-03-21 18:54:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm I'm pretty easy, but orange juice is always appreciated. I might bring up some beer from a Katy brewery that I really like too.
2014-03-21 18:55:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was your first day at the internship?
2014-03-21 18:57:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was good. Pretty chill. We all seem to get along really well, which is cool.
2014-03-21 18:57:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was your flight?
2014-03-21 18:59:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And do you mind high pulp? So no snack requests? And yay to the beer.
2014-03-21 19:04:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ballin', very official. If you're picking up something new I'd probs prefer lower/no pulp but if you already have some high pulp is totally fine. Is there a kind if beer you don't really like?
2014-03-21 19:05:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wheat beers
2014-03-21 19:05:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]usually
2014-03-21 19:13:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Such a stereotypical man response haha. Flight was decent, read a long-ass paper on oysters and then napped in a little ball 
2014-03-21 19:15:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey! I'm more than just football and IPAs you know?
2014-03-21 19:18:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know :)
2014-03-21 19:22:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just saw a puppy jump up and give this 2 (?) year old kisses. It was pretty cute.
2014-03-21 19:25:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]D'aww. That's one of the downsides of cats, they rarely do adorable things with children. And are more likely to suffocate them...
2014-03-21 19:28:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha truth. My cat had a reputation for clawing the shit out of people's ankles when they were coming down the stairs.
2014-03-21 19:28:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How you liking life above 70 degrees?
2014-03-21 19:40:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My hair has already expanded 4 inches outwards
2014-03-21 19:50:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha awesome.
2014-03-21 20:38:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How are the parents?
2014-03-21 20:41:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Typical parentals. Watching a little basketball with some beer with my dad now
2014-03-21 20:41:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word
2014-03-21 20:42:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tourney has been pretty crazy
2014-03-21 20:44:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know! I'm loving it, Ohio State is always on my shit list
2014-03-21 20:44:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is that retroactive hate?
2014-03-21 20:45:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you saying you hated Ohio State might've gotten me a little arouse by the way
2014-03-21 20:45:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-21 20:45:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some I inherited, but solidified by our football games with then 
2014-03-21 20:45:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or that they're on your shit list
2014-03-21 20:46:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely hate them
2014-03-21 20:46:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha me too
2014-03-21 20:46:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my whole family does
2014-03-21 20:46:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you had no affiliation when they lost the championship right?
2014-03-21 20:46:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah fuck
2014-03-21 20:46:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was 2003
2014-03-21 20:46:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-03-21 20:50:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha nah, I was a wee little longhorns fan back then I'm sure
2014-03-21 20:51:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But once I got to UM and looked up who I should hate now I definitely heard about it haha
2014-03-21 20:51:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's important is that you hate them.
2014-03-21 20:51:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-03-21 20:52:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so who else don't you guys like?
2014-03-21 20:52:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess ND back in the day
2014-03-21 20:52:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they haven't been relevant in a while
2014-03-21 20:52:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]FSU?
2014-03-21 20:53:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitelyyyy FSU. And UF out of spite
2014-03-21 20:53:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]spite in what way?
2014-03-21 20:54:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or what's the source I guess
2014-03-21 20:54:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Statewide grudges, and they've just been much better than us the whole time I was there. And I have an ex-bf from Gainesville that was an obnoxious gators fan lol
2014-03-21 20:55:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha all valid reasons
2014-03-21 20:55:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]AU vs. UF was one of the best games I went to as an undergrad
2014-03-21 20:55:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we were the only team that beat them that year
2014-03-21 20:55:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I claimed we were the transitive property national champs
2014-03-21 20:56:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2006
2014-03-21 20:56:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha it counts. Must've been a lot of shades of orange and blue at that game
2014-03-21 20:57:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there was
2014-03-21 20:57:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the game was crazy
2014-03-21 20:57:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Auburn blocked a punt for a touchdown
2014-03-21 20:57:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]heading into the endzone where the student section was
2014-03-21 20:57:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]people lost it
2014-03-21 21:00:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Damnnnn
2014-03-21 21:01:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I think I'm gonna leave here like 8:30-9,try to get there a little after 1
2014-03-21 21:01:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's your address?
2014-03-21 21:02:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ohh coming in early, I like it    😃 
2014-03-21 21:02:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]7740 McCallum Blvd
2014-03-21 21:02:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dallas, TX 75252
2014-03-21 21:02:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is that too early? Are you busy at all tm?
2014-03-21 21:02:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hell no it's not too early!
2014-03-21 21:02:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you couldn't get here early enough
2014-03-21 21:03:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just didn't expect you to get up and rolling in the morning
2014-03-21 21:04:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Welllll that's the plan, we'll see if it actually happens lol
2014-03-21 21:04:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I dig
2014-03-21 21:04:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'm excited to see ya
2014-03-21 21:05:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too, very much so
2014-03-21 21:06:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dat dopamine when I read that
2014-03-21 21:07:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you seen Coraline?
2014-03-21 21:11:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That book severely disturbed me as a child, so no I haven't 
2014-03-21 21:12:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Things involving eyes and needles freak me out
2014-03-21 21:12:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, the reason I asked was because there's a post on reddit asking "What movie would freak you out the most if it was based on a true story?"
2014-03-21 21:13:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And the second best comment is "Coraline. imagine kids getting their eyeballs removed, replaced and sewn up with buttons by psychopath parents"
2014-03-21 21:13:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I loved that movie, though
2014-03-21 21:13:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should read the book
2014-03-21 21:14:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The movie looked like it would be good, but I just can't do it. What movies do you have on your list to watch?
2014-03-21 21:17:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still need to see The Fall
2014-03-21 21:17:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I feel like I gotta be in the right state of mind
2014-03-21 21:17:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Argo is high on my list right now
2014-03-21 21:17:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A lot of these movies ->  http://blog.vornaskotti.com/2014/02/15/the-interesting-indie-sci-fi-flicks-that-restored-my-hope-for-sci-fi-films-as-a-whole/
2014-03-21 21:50:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh man all of those sound amazing. I've seen the addendum movies but non of the top ones
2014-03-21 21:51:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think Europa Report is on Netflix
2014-03-21 21:52:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-03-21 21:52:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think Rob Arthur recommended that one too
2014-03-21 21:53:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We probably should've watched it instead of event horizon lol
2014-03-21 21:53:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's all good
2014-03-21 21:53:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]honestly I got such a kick out of your jumps that it was worth it
2014-03-21 21:54:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm a little tooo empathetic sometimes, or get sucked into a story too easily.
2014-03-21 21:54:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm also gullible as fuck
2014-03-21 21:55:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha really? I guess I haven't really tested that.
2014-03-21 21:55:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt I will, though
2014-03-21 22:00:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I appreciate that, most of my friends usually don't have the same restraint. When it comes to being critical about science shit, I'm great. But for some reason I'll believe even ridiculous stuff coming out of someone's mouth 
2014-03-21 22:03:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna crawl in bed with momma and watch last weeks cosmos. I'll text you when I'm on my way tm!
2014-03-21 22:08:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yesss. Have a goodnight. And its crazy how disconnected science smarts and street smarts can be.
2014-03-22 09:54:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On my way! ETA 2p :)
2014-03-22 09:55:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can't wait! Drive safe.
2014-03-24 14:10:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just found a curly hair in my hood :) Miss you already.
2014-03-24 14:53:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You might be finding those for a while haha, pesky things get everywhere 
2014-03-24 15:03:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We didn't take a picture together!
2014-03-24 15:46:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I knowww
2014-03-24 15:57:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Would you mind if I posted the pics I have of you? Or is that a little to out in the open? No worries if so!
2014-03-24 16:21:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha no you should! Just maybe later tn after I've had a chance to talk to my momma a little about it :)
2014-03-24 16:22:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got to houston just in time to catch some rush hour traffic -_-
2014-03-24 16:22:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. Are you in traffic now?
2014-03-24 16:24:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah. I'm ALMOST home, but not quite lol
2014-03-24 16:25:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha *nervously knocks on wood*. Did the tire replacement go smoothly?
2014-03-24 16:34:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup, and they had free coffee which was dope.
2014-03-24 16:35:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-03-24 16:42:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Home!
2014-03-24 16:42:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hooray! Well... kinda    😕 
2014-03-24 16:58:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mother thinks I'm quite lucky that you didn't turn out to be an axe murderer and I could've been chopped up and buried in your backyard
2014-03-24 16:58:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaaaa damn!
2014-03-24 16:59:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]She knows I went to UChicago?
2014-03-24 16:59:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've been vetted!
2014-03-24 16:59:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I told her the whole story and that you came with excellent references 
2014-03-24 17:01:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well I guess she's still, right! I could've still been an axe murderer.
2014-03-24 17:01:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe the opportunity just never came up?    😉 
2014-03-24 17:03:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you've been pretending to be an amazing guy your entire life just to lure me in to kill, I'd actually be a little flattered 
2014-03-24 17:04:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha, all according to plan!
2014-03-24 17:11:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]found your red panties, lol
2014-03-24 17:12:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nooooo those are my favorites!
2014-03-24 17:14:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man. I like them too, but they don't have quite the same effect when they aren't on you.
2014-03-24 17:15:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Please tell me you aren't trying on my dirty underwear? That would give me a little cause for concern lol
2014-03-24 17:16:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]define "trying on"
2014-03-24 17:16:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just kidding
2014-03-24 17:16:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what should I do with them, though?
2014-03-24 17:16:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You just want me to throw them in with my laundry?
2014-03-24 17:18:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, that would be great. Wash them in cold/bright colors setting instead of hot water though unless you want all your shirts pink lol
2014-03-24 17:18:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds good.
2014-03-24 17:20:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What is the point of washing clothes in hot water?
2014-03-24 17:22:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's good for a bunch of cotton whites, but I think detergent is good enough now it's not really necessary
2014-03-24 17:22:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word, that's why I asked.
2014-03-24 18:02:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think my dad may not 'believe' in global climate change *face palm* 
2014-03-24 18:03:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh no
2014-03-24 18:03:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-03-24 18:03:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that it is happening or that humanity has contributed? Or both?
2014-03-24 18:05:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess that it's not something worth worrying about. I talked about the Perot and it's treatment of CC and he kinda scoffed at it and then changed the subject 
2014-03-24 18:06:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess he does help build natural gas pipelines and oil rigs, soooo maybe it makes sense that we've never talked it
2014-03-24 18:06:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I was honestly a little curious about that when you mentioned it
2014-03-24 18:06:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure that's a little frustrating
2014-03-24 18:12:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh, it's kinda funny. And at least he's not actively arguing for the other side
2014-03-24 19:08:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Another album recommendation?
2014-03-24 20:15:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm, other important albums for me would probably be Butterflies and Hurricanes by Muse, Kid A and In Rainbows by Radiohead, both Bon Iver albums, and Phosphene Dream by Black Angels. You've probably heard most of those
2014-03-24 20:16:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The last has some great rock moments, but you might feel the same way you did about wye oak
2014-03-24 20:18:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also James Blake has some very emotional music 
2014-03-24 20:29:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool. I think the only Muse album I've listened to is Black Holes and Revelations and that was a while back. Like when it came out. I recently listened to Kid A for the first time. Liked it, but wasn't blown away. "Everything in Its Right Place" has been one of my favorite songs for a long time, though. I listened to In Rainbows when it came out. Like Kid A, I remember not being blown away by it, but liking several songs. I haven't listened to any Bon Iver. I YouTubed their name when they were getting a bunch of hype for that 2011 record and I remember being kind of bored with it, but I'll give them a real listen. I think the Black Angels opened for The Black Keys when I saw them in Atlanta in 2006, but I've never really listened to them. I realllly like "Measurements" off of James Blake's self-titled album and I like "Limit To Your Love", but those were the only two tracks that stood out to me. I'll put all of the ones I haven't listened to recently in my rotation, though.
2014-03-24 20:37:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Black Holes and Revelations is what I meant. I agree that Radiohead's strength may be more in their singles than in albums. For Emma, Long Ago is, to me, amazing. But might be pretty mood dependent, as it's quiet and sad most of the time.
2014-03-24 20:39:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I Never Learnt to Share is probably my favorite James Blake song from that album
2014-03-24 20:42:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you decide to go to glitch mob?
2014-03-24 20:46:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah, I got some homework due tomorrow I need to work on
2014-03-24 20:47:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll try to get into my most melancholy of moods before I listen to Bon Iver
2014-03-24 20:51:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm listening to "I Never Learnt to Share" right now and I remember liking that one too. I didn't give it a thumbs up for some reason.
2014-03-24 20:54:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's pretty good. I'm watching Cosmos and NdGT is talking about how life on Titan could possibly breathe hydrogen and exhale methane and evolved in lakes of hydrocarbons 
2014-03-24 20:55:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm, that's interesting
2014-03-24 20:55:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that show has already established they are gonna speculate the shit out of some things, though
2014-03-24 20:56:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-03-24 20:56:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the hydrocarbons thing is possible
2014-03-24 20:56:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but whether or not that is likely is another question
2014-03-24 20:56:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'd lean towards not likely
2014-03-24 20:56:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the hydrogen thing I don't understand
2014-03-24 20:57:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He was just using it as an example of how life could be in very different forms using different chemical metabolic pathways elsewhere in the universe
2014-03-24 20:58:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not that it was likely
2014-03-24 20:58:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well
2014-03-24 20:58:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-03-24 20:58:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll have to see it I guess
2014-03-24 20:58:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it sounds similar to the multiverse thing to me
2014-03-24 20:59:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah I'm not explaining it well, and maybe he's not either. But the episode on evolution and life I totally dug
2014-03-24 20:59:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that the most recent one?
2014-03-24 20:59:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No it's the 2nd one
2014-03-24 20:59:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh okay. Yeah I need to catch up.
2014-03-24 21:01:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I think they're definitely worth watching
2014-03-24 21:03:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm probably being overly critical about the speculative stuff. I guess they're just trying to create intrigue. But I don't really feel like that kind of speculation is necessary to reveal the awesomeness of the universe, and I think the presentation could lead laypeople to believing something that might not necessarily be true.
2014-03-24 21:04:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like someone using Cosmos to say life could evolve on a planet without water
2014-03-24 21:04:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]might it be possible? Yes. But so is basically anything that respects the laws of physics.
2014-03-24 21:04:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like they're doing a pretty good job delineating fact from speculation. Andddd life could possible evolve on a planet without water, we don't know.
2014-03-24 21:05:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I agree, we don't know. But I'm saying you might as well speculate on any number of things then.
2014-03-24 21:07:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In cases like this, I actually applaud that kind of open-mindedness. I think it prevents us (humans) from purely designing hypotheses limited by our current understanding of the universe. 
2014-03-24 21:09:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Isn't the idea that life could evolve in hydrocarbons a hypothesis based on our current understanding of the universe?
2014-03-24 21:24:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes, but not our current understanding of life I guess. And even still you're saying it might be ridiculous to speculate it as a possibility 
2014-03-24 21:24:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha hold your horses
2014-03-24 21:25:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not saying it's ridiculous to speculate that
2014-03-24 21:25:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-03-24 21:27:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just that it's not really all that valuable for revealing the awesomeness of the universe. It's more stuff for science fiction, in my opinion. But maybe that's part of the show! Just to take my point to the extreme, it's theoretically possible, in that it would not break the laws of physics, for there to be a planet identical to Earth somewhere out in the universe with an identical Katie and Michael talking about Cosmos, but the probability of that is infinitesimally small and not really worth bringing up when talking about the universe.
2014-03-24 21:27:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's sort of extreme, but it makes my point.
2014-03-24 21:27:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is infinitesimally small redundant?
2014-03-24 21:27:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it is
2014-03-24 21:28:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]infinitesimal should've been what I said
2014-03-24 21:30:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well my existence exactly as I am is due to an infinitesimally small probability of events occurring haha.  You should watch the show, before judging it's speculation based on my comments 
2014-03-24 21:31:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oooook
2014-03-24 21:31:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sorry if I'm being annoying about this stuff
2014-03-24 21:31:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-24 21:32:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can be bullheaded at times
2014-03-24 21:32:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love it
2014-03-24 21:32:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha good
2014-03-24 21:32:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah you seem to not take my shit
2014-03-24 21:32:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is awesome
2014-03-24 21:32:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would only be better if we could argue about it in person
2014-03-24 21:33:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]agreed    😃 
2014-03-24 21:34:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think it's shit, you have opinions that are intelligently formed.
2014-03-24 21:34:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's great
2014-03-24 21:36:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's a nice way of putting it! haha. I'm glad you're into it. I like how you have a lot of things to say too.
2014-03-24 21:38:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I ate some glass
2014-03-24 21:38:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely need my shit called out too sometimes
2014-03-24 21:38:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-03-24 21:39:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What???
2014-03-24 21:39:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I dropped a spaghetti sauce jar on the ground
2014-03-24 21:39:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the jar cracked
2014-03-24 21:39:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but nothing came out
2014-03-24 21:39:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I figured it was good
2014-03-24 21:39:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it didn't shatter or anything
2014-03-24 21:39:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I made my spaghetti
2014-03-24 21:40:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and when I was just eating it I got a bite that was like really crunchy
2014-03-24 21:40:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]kinda when you get sand on your food
2014-03-24 21:40:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and so I spit it out
2014-03-24 21:40:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and another bite had it
2014-03-24 21:40:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I couldn't see anything
2014-03-24 21:40:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sooo
2014-03-24 21:40:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I ate some glass
2014-03-24 21:41:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and now my Google search history has "i think i ate glass"
2014-03-24 21:41:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty terrifying
2014-03-24 21:41:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-03-24 21:42:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-03-24 21:42:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good news is I'm pretty sure I'm ok
2014-03-24 21:42:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bad news is I'm having Cap'n Crunch for dinner
2014-03-24 21:43:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like trading a crunch for a Crunch
2014-03-24 21:43:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooooh man
2014-03-24 21:43:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got a nice belly laugh out of that
2014-03-24 21:46:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I posted the pic I have of you looking quite studly by the cowboy
2014-03-24 21:46:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha studly, huh?
2014-03-24 21:46:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha yesss
2014-03-24 21:46:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hood up and shades on
2014-03-24 21:48:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the pics I have of you don't show how high up it is
2014-03-24 21:48:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they're still good
2014-03-24 21:49:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I just look unnecessarily terrified? Haha
2014-03-24 21:49:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-24 21:49:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-03-24 21:49:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty much
2014-03-24 21:52:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love the Perot Museum pic
2014-03-24 21:52:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I posted them by the way
2014-03-24 22:03:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I saw. The Perot one is pretty tight, though I feel I could've come up with a better pose lol
2014-03-24 22:04:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ha, next time!
2014-03-24 22:09:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you already
2014-03-24 22:09:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn, I was just thinking the same thing
2014-03-24 22:09:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My one sappy comment of the week 
2014-03-24 22:09:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-24 22:09:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll take it
2014-03-24 22:12:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the long distance thing sucks, but I'm not really scared about it
2014-03-24 22:12:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is something I guess
2014-03-24 22:15:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not either. 
2014-03-24 22:16:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I also might've totally left my favorite underwear there just to guarantee we see each other again haha
2014-03-24 22:16:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha sneaky
2014-03-24 22:26:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mom and I are following up Cosmos with more educational entertainment: Hangover 3 
2014-03-24 22:27:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-24 22:27:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my dad was disappointed with that one
2014-03-24 22:28:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he really liked the first couple
2014-03-24 22:30:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The 1st one was genuinely entertaining, but this one is attempting a little more character development than the others I think. 
2014-03-24 22:31:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm probably something to do with the reason he didn't like it
2014-03-24 22:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not that my dad isn't into character development
2014-03-24 22:31:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't think that's why he was watching The Hangover 3
2014-03-24 22:31:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-24 22:32:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth, I don't think it's why anyone watches those movies
2014-03-24 22:56:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kitty snuggling with momma's arm
2014-03-24 22:56:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's one content looking kitty
2014-03-24 22:56:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He's hamming it up for the camera a little 
2014-03-24 22:57:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-24 22:58:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he's doing a good job
2014-03-24 22:58:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm about to pass out too. Goodnight, try not to miss me waking up at 3am to drink your OJ too much :)
2014-03-24 22:59:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw, I'm gonna miss it a lot
2014-03-24 22:59:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how am I supposed to fall asleep on the couch tonight??
2014-03-24 22:59:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-24 22:59:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet dreams
2014-03-24 23:00:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You too 
2014-03-25 07:51:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You also forgot your sexy maroon socks. The way you wore them inside out drove me wild ;)
2014-03-25 08:00:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha you're goofy. 
2014-03-25 09:45:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Fuckin surrealists" - Katie Silliman
2014-03-25 09:52:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-03-25 09:53:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely had a love/hate relationship with the author during that book. Either being overly critical or just loving the entire concept of it
2014-03-25 10:55:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I'm actually not that into most surrealist/dadaist art, aesthetically. Even a lot of Dalí's stuff I find kinda tacky. I find them more interesting as movements.
2014-03-25 10:56:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"art", in this case, including lit.
2014-03-25 10:56:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Stream of conscious stuff can get kind of grating
2014-03-25 11:18:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He focuses in as the book goes on. And when I started reading, the complex meandering sentences definitely annoyed me but once I slowed down and took the time to pick them apart, I feel like I learned a lot more about the movement/concepts than I ever did from classes or like Wikipedia lol.
2014-03-25 11:18:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it's not a book you can read in the same way as most 
2014-03-25 11:36:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I find some of his musings on different artists kind of interesting, like the thing about Victor Hugo and the woman on the carriage. But it all feels a little unfocused, which I get is the point, but I guess I disagree with the surrealists that every single thing that pops into your subconscious is important/necessary to convey meaningful art. But I'm not not [sic] enjoying it. I think it's pretty interesting so far. And I really like reading all of your comments    😃 
2014-03-25 14:05:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Realizing that I missed a guy talk at SICB about the genetic adaptation of pacific oysters to OA = major retroactive guilt
2014-03-25 14:53:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"OA"? And that's a bummer. I'm sure you'll run into him in the future.
2014-03-25 14:54:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ocean acidification
2014-03-25 14:54:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gotcha
2014-03-25 14:55:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was 8:00a on Monday, pretty sure I just slept in. Not even a hangover as an excuse lol
2014-03-25 14:55:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, you didn't know you'd be working with oysters at that point, though, right?
2014-03-25 14:59:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, but it was on genotype-environment interactions which inherently is right up my alley lol
2014-03-25 15:00:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well shame on you then    😉 
2014-03-25 15:01:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woahh Lolla sold out in a day without even the lineup out. That shit cray
2014-03-25 15:01:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, they've done that the past few years
2014-03-25 15:02:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]three 1-day passes isn't much of a worse deal than a 3-day pass, though
2014-03-25 15:02:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the days can kinda vary wildly in quality honestly
2014-03-25 15:03:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth. The leaked lineup is prettyyyy blah though so I don't really care
2014-03-25 15:03:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, you think you're gonna pass then?
2014-03-25 15:04:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless Outkast is playing one day, I definitely will
2014-03-25 15:04:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-03-25 15:04:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The North Coast lineup from last yr though sounds amazing
2014-03-25 15:05:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]North Coast is where it's at, man
2014-03-25 15:05:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really want to go back
2014-03-25 15:09:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should def go this year, but I'm obviously biased towards any opportunity that might bring you to Chicago 
2014-03-25 15:10:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-03-25 15:10:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll have to see what is going on in my life at that point
2014-03-25 15:10:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think if funds and time are availalbe
2014-03-25 15:10:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be something I'd like to do
2014-03-25 15:25:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so "Butterflies and Hurricanes" is off of Absolution
2014-03-25 15:25:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you said Black Holes and Revelations was the album you were thinking of
2014-03-25 15:25:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that correct?
2014-03-25 15:30:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Absolution is the one I meant, but really it's both of those that I like 
2014-03-25 15:30:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-03-25 16:20:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm on board with Bon Iver
2014-03-25 16:21:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not sure why I thought I wouldn't like it
2014-03-25 16:21:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna give For Emma, Forever Ago another listen later and follow along with the lyrics
2014-03-25 16:50:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you might be :)
2014-03-25 16:52:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm talking further with the parents about buying a car. 
2014-03-25 16:53:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's turning into a pretty annoying conversation actually 
2014-03-25 16:55:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why's that?
2014-03-25 17:02:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mom doesn't know as much as she thinks about how financing cars works, and she prefers the easiest purchasing method (ie go to the guy down the street we've always bought from) instead of intelligently shopping around 
2014-03-25 17:04:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And she's asked like 5 other random parents for their "input" so I'm filling out their questionnaires about what I want. Which is silly, because I'm quite capable of using google to compare cars myself
2014-03-25 17:05:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm, I honestly don't know shit about buying cars so I would probably have to rely on my parents pretty heavily
2014-03-25 17:18:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I don't necessarily either, I just get frustrated with my parents way on handling things sometimes haha
2014-03-25 17:20:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah, I dig. I know it took my parents a while to adjust from "parenting" to "providing advice to an adult".
2014-03-25 17:23:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes, that's the issue! We're definitely closer to the latter in this house. To the point that when I accomplish minor things like register for classes on time or book a flight by myself Mom gets teary-eyed with pride (ugh)
2014-03-25 17:24:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-25 17:24:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she sounds like a really sweet lady
2014-03-25 17:24:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-03-25 17:42:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's the sweetest lady on the planet and I hardly deserve her. But argh does she get under my skin sometimes
2014-03-25 18:14:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a big fire ya got there in Houston
2014-03-25 18:15:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is indeed, I was actually gonna go get drinks with some friends in the neighborhood after dinner but now it looks like we'll just be hitting up KTX bars
2014-03-25 18:16:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty wild. At least the building was unoccupied.
2014-03-25 18:17:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, pretty remarkable there were no injuries actually 
2014-03-25 19:09:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Taking a bubble bath in the jacuzzi tub and severely wishing you were here. Though we'd probably disagree on the water temp  ;)
2014-03-25 19:10:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds pretty sexy... but fuck no am I ever taking a bath with you
2014-03-25 19:14:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha I'm down for some negotiation and compromise
2014-03-25 19:18:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-03-25 22:53:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The sequence in the data center reminded me a lot of 2001 too
2014-03-25 22:53:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In Love
2014-03-25 22:54:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this whole ending sequence I guess
2014-03-25 22:54:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the whole mysterious structure thing is reminscent of the monolith from 2001
2014-03-25 22:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I reckon that's all intentional
2014-03-25 22:55:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I had fallen asleep about half way in
2014-03-25 22:55:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I had missed a bunch
2014-03-25 22:56:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was good, though
2014-03-25 22:56:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad we got to kinda experience it together, haha
2014-03-26 01:26:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'm glad you finished it. Definitely has some less-than-subtle homages to 2001. And the human-machine-connections comment at the end, it was kinda difficult for me to really understand what they were trying to say
2014-03-26 01:28:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Got a tinyyy bit tipsy this evening. Good ol fireball shots 
2014-03-26 10:24:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Outkast at Lolla!
2014-03-26 12:05:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I tried to get one before my flight took off and I missed it :/
2014-03-26 12:07:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]People probably craigslist them for a reasonable amount a few days before though, right?
2014-03-26 12:52:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol, something like that.
2014-03-26 14:23:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In Miami!
2014-03-26 14:26:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweeet! Have an awesome time and relax extra hard at the beach for me.
2014-03-26 15:05:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The weather feels amazingggg
2014-03-26 15:52:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awesome. I better see a bikini pic this week ;)
2014-03-26 17:17:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can make that happen :)
2014-03-26 19:28:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miamiii
2014-03-26 20:52:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ooh looks like fun. Who is it? How is it?
2014-03-27 01:42:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A-Trak. Spinnin and getting the crowd going. Followed up by Boys Noize and R.L. Grime, in case you're somehow still awake 
2014-03-27 17:05:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]smitten
2014-03-27 17:05:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What have you been up to?
2014-03-27 17:06:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just at lunch with a dude where we discussed the meaning (or lack thereof) of life for a couple of hours, haha
2014-03-27 17:06:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't get a notification for that pic for some reason so I just saw it
2014-03-27 17:07:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got to bring you up a couple of times,
2014-03-27 17:07:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] which was fun    😃 
2014-03-27 17:07:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is Miami?
2014-03-27 17:09:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like a pretty great lunch. I've definitely talked about you to my friends here. 
2014-03-27 17:09:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, yay!
2014-03-27 17:10:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miami is pretty great. I haven't really been sober since I got picked up from the airport haha, and tonight we're going to shows from 7p-10a. 
2014-03-27 17:10:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha damn
2014-03-27 17:10:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might be too old for this ish though 
2014-03-27 17:10:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you gonna roll?
2014-03-27 17:11:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ain't no way I could make it through the night if I wasn't rolling or tripping
2014-03-27 17:11:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who the fuck is playing at 6 am, though?
2014-03-27 17:12:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna trip for sure. And maybeee a little blow right now :)
2014-03-27 17:12:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word.
2014-03-27 17:13:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jamie Jones is from 2:30a on. He's pretty fun
2014-03-27 17:13:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]coool
2014-03-27 17:18:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't trip while kayaking after all, but it was still pretty tight
2014-03-27 17:18:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that honestly looks like a blast
2014-03-27 17:19:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've wanted to go kayaking for a while
2014-03-27 17:19:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wish I could've joined ya!
2014-03-27 17:19:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you see any gators?
2014-03-27 17:21:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too! Maybe down the Chicago river sometime :)
2014-03-27 17:21:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I only saw some turtles chillin' and baby ducks
2014-03-27 17:21:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]turtles are always fun to see
2014-03-27 17:22:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess baby ducks are cute too
2014-03-27 17:22:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I tend to gravitate towards the non-avian reptiles, though
2014-03-27 17:22:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I figured, gotta love those herps
2014-03-27 17:23:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]all your friends happy to see you?
2014-03-27 17:29:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I ran into a lot of people last night too which was fun, lots of surprised faces. It's a little surreal being back
2014-03-27 17:37:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah going back to Auburn is always a little strange for me.
2014-03-27 17:42:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's also kinda weird seeing my friends that are still here exactly the same as when I left, while I feel like I've changed a lot 
2014-03-27 17:44:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. Well I guess you have changed a lot! At least in setting and status, which probably has a lot to do with it.
2014-03-27 17:59:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I matured significantly in the past 8 months. 
2014-03-27 18:07:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, turns out I'm just gonna buy my dad's car off of him. So I'll probably be back in Houston again soon to drive it up!
2014-03-27 18:19:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I guess you've sort of started your career now, which is a pretty mature/adult thing to do. And that's exciting about the car (on multiple fronts... assuming you'll be swinging through Dallas on the way up)
2014-03-27 18:44:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously I would be
2014-03-27 18:46:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet.
2014-03-27 18:46:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You don't have a timeframe on that do you?
2014-03-27 18:47:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah, when I get back I'll figure it out. I'm not really in a rush. 
2014-03-27 18:47:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think you'll be free between when finals end and the internship begins?
2014-03-27 18:48:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah for sure. I was thinking that might be a good time for us to get together
2014-03-27 18:48:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is that when you are thinking about making the drive?
2014-03-27 18:48:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too :)
2014-03-27 18:50:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was thinking we coulddd drive up together and then you just fly to NC from Chicago. But that's a big maybe and might not be that convenient for you 
2014-03-27 18:51:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmmm... yeah I'm gonna need to figure some things out as far me getting out there and my auto situation.
2014-03-27 18:51:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm still not sure what the car thing is gonna be.
2014-03-27 18:52:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Eh, whatever.
2014-03-27 18:52:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll make it work    😃 
2014-03-27 18:52:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Driving up to Chicago with you would be a lot of fun.
2014-03-27 18:53:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah it was just an idea, or I can hang in Dallas for a few days then before driving up by myself.
2014-03-27 18:53:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'd rather head up to Chicago with you, so I'll try to make that happen.
2014-03-27 18:54:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd probably give us at least an extra day too right?
2014-03-27 18:54:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just using me as an excuse to visit chicago, aren't you?
2014-03-27 18:54:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I gotta take 'em where I can get 'em
2014-03-27 18:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-27 18:54:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, no
2014-03-27 18:54:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Although that is a nice incentive.
2014-03-27 18:54:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I was more thinking we could maybe stop somewhere on the way up?
2014-03-27 18:55:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A nature-y place.
2014-03-27 18:55:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yesss. Do a little camping
2014-03-27 18:55:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Exactly    😃 
2014-03-27 18:55:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn, girl. You got me all excited.
2014-03-27 18:55:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I likes ya a lot
2014-03-27 18:57:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're giving me a big goofy smile 
2014-03-27 18:57:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yesss, love your smile
2014-03-27 19:30:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dead Space is available for free on Origin (EA's answer to Steam). I doubt I'll have time to play in the next month and a half, but I'll definitely try it out over the summer.
2014-03-27 22:20:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should def try it out over the summer. I'd lend you mine, except you don't have a 360 :)
2014-03-27 22:20:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Want a loud video of poor quality of Skrillex?
2014-03-27 22:20:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I have it for free now on PC, so I should manage!
2014-03-27 22:20:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yes!
2014-03-27 22:22:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I can send it with hangouts?
2014-03-27 22:23:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, yeah. I don't really know how to share videos without using something like YouTube/Facebook/G+
2014-03-27 22:25:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Night going okay so far?
2014-03-27 22:42:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah! We just dropped so it's barely started in a way
2014-03-27 22:43:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cooool. Have fun getting weird    😃  Feel free to share any interesting thoughts, but only if you're feeling it    😃 
2014-03-27 22:43:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Here's one of the rooms at the place that's going all night
2014-03-27 22:43:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Looks nice and stimulating
2014-03-27 22:44:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I don't know if I'll quite be able to operate the phone, but we'll see :)
2014-03-27 22:44:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha completely understand... enjoy your trip!
2014-03-28 16:26:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yo
2014-03-28 17:11:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was a nutty evening 
2014-03-28 17:51:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha have you come back to Earth?
2014-03-28 17:52:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I was wondering why you were using Facebook. Figured it was just what the universe wanted you to do at the time, haha.
2014-03-28 17:52:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah the universe never wants me to get on Facebook.
2014-03-28 17:53:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a struggle and didn't even accomplish what I intended lol
2014-03-28 17:53:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm chilling in my old apt now alone with this tiny rat dog they just got
2014-03-28 17:54:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well I appreciated the effort.
2014-03-28 17:54:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Should I feel threatened ;)
2014-03-28 17:55:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a grade A snuggler, but no where near your caliber
2014-03-28 17:57:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would lovee some hamburger helper right now 
2014-03-28 17:58:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha you're a nut
2014-03-28 17:59:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You experience anything exceptionally weird last night?
2014-03-28 18:00:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]/this morning.
2014-03-28 18:00:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We were there until 10a. My feet are in a world of pain right now, I barely sat down once.
2014-03-28 18:01:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure I could keep up with you, kid.
2014-03-28 18:02:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, I was barely keeping up myself. 
2014-03-28 18:03:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It got pretty weird all the way around. There were a lot of people just drinking and occasionally guys would come try to hit on me and my friend Natasha and we would just end up giggling uncontrollably at them.
2014-03-28 18:03:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I felt bad, because it probably came across as super rude but we just could not handle those conversations 
2014-03-28 18:04:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol that's awesome. I can't even imagine trying to engage with any kind of courtship behavior while tripping.
2014-03-28 18:04:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It would just all seem so absurd I'm sure.
2014-03-28 18:09:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So you gonna start it up again tonight?
2014-03-28 18:18:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was super absurd. The lights/music/setup was pretty perfect. And got to see a great sunrise. There's a free show I mighttt go to tonight, but I think I may just watch basketball and drink a couple beers.
2014-03-28 18:20:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Sunrises after a long night are amazing.
2014-03-28 18:24:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should do some acid haha
2014-03-28 18:28:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely wished you were there, it's probably the only thing that would've made my night better
2014-03-28 18:31:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're so effing sweet
2014-03-28 18:37:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm so happy that I'll probably be able to see you in like a month and a half. 
2014-03-28 18:54:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm liking this afterglow you got going :)
2014-03-28 18:54:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I can't wait to see you again. A month and a half seems like forever, though!
2014-03-28 18:58:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]6 weeks, they'll fly by. 
2014-03-28 18:58:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What are you doing this weekend?
2014-03-28 19:04:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Gonna try and get some work done. April is gonna be hellish. It's been kinda stressing me out :/
2014-03-28 19:05:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth. Do you have projects due for any of your classes?
2014-03-28 19:05:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah three of them.
2014-03-28 19:06:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And a bunch of homework and exams on top of that.
2014-03-28 19:07:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Part of the stress is stemming from the fact I don't think the classes are being taught very well too.
2014-03-28 19:07:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it's all good. I've decided to turn it into a me vs. them thing and that's helping to motivate me.
2014-03-28 19:09:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure you'll do just fine despite the lack of help on their part. How was day 2 of the internship today?
2014-03-28 19:11:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good. I'm actually on the way home now. I actually feel kinda bad because I'm basically just watching workshop videos right now to learn different techniques. It's easy money. I really like the people who work there, though.
2014-03-28 19:14:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I may need to get you to help me with my NGS data in the future, so I'm glad you're learning how to do it now :)
2014-03-28 19:25:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'd be really fun.
2014-03-28 19:25:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I kinda wonder if I would've stuck out the PhD thing if I had been doing bioinformatics
2014-03-28 19:26:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might've helped get you through the 2 years of classes, if it was something you were more passionate about.
2014-03-28 19:27:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I would've felt better about my future too, though, which was a big reason for me leaving
2014-03-28 19:27:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There is definitely a need for bioinformaticians
2014-03-28 19:28:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, who knows how things will work out.
2014-03-28 19:28:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm really glad I have this opportunity and the one at Red Hat
2014-03-28 19:29:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like it'll give me a good idea of my options
2014-03-28 19:38:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm almost finished with Nadja. I appreciate you calling the author out on the reg.
2014-03-28 19:41:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At some point going through that book I think I got a little frustrated at the blatant sexism (even though that may have been how it was when it was written), but I finished the book with some respect for the author and not hating him
2014-03-28 19:41:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It refreshing how self aware he is at points
2014-03-28 19:42:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He's painfully not self-aware too, though
2014-03-28 19:42:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like he's really condescending towards the working class
2014-03-28 19:43:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I share his opinions on the "value" of hard work (in that I don't value it for its own sake), but he's kinda an asshole towards people who do work hard
2014-03-28 19:44:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And his worship of this girl who is clearly unstable was off putting to me
2014-03-28 19:44:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh absolutely! Not everyone is born into enough comfort to be able to espouse that kind of attitude
2014-03-28 19:45:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least that's how I read it
2014-03-28 19:45:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know he claims that she's not and whatever
2014-03-28 19:45:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the "system" is fucked
2014-03-28 19:45:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I thought she was unstable from the beginning
2014-03-28 19:46:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it made me uncomfortable what he was doing
2014-03-28 19:46:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He absolutely helps drive her to insanity
2014-03-28 19:46:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I still have a bit left, so I probably shouldn't form my opinions entirely yet
2014-03-28 19:47:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's an interesting read for sure, though
2014-03-28 19:47:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might not be a book that leaves you warm and fuzzy
2014-03-28 19:47:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad you recommended it to me
2014-03-28 19:47:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, it's different than anything I've read
2014-03-28 19:47:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish I had your annotations in everything I read, haha
2014-03-28 19:47:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty fun
2014-03-28 19:48:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should've written your own in there
2014-03-28 19:48:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I took a few notes on a sheet of paper
2014-03-28 19:48:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't know how you'd feel about me writing in your book
2014-03-28 19:49:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't nearly as prodigious as you, though
2014-03-28 19:49:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]only a few things
2014-03-28 19:52:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would like to see them, only fair as you got to read all of my random thoughts going through that book.
2014-03-28 19:52:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've only done that to 4 or 5 books  to that extent 
2014-03-28 19:53:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, you seemed to really dig into some of the things he was saying
2014-03-28 19:54:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I literally have four notes, lol... it's not gonna be that rewarding for you to read them, but I'll leave them in there.
2014-03-28 20:08:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you heard of Buku?
2014-03-28 20:08:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, it sounds like a ton of fun
2014-03-28 20:09:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, my friend Justin (the guy who is going to Montana, I'm going to quit calling him the guy who is going to Montana) went
2014-03-28 20:09:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm thinking it might be something I try to get to next year
2014-03-28 20:11:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll make sure to remember that every time you say "Justin" you mean "the guy going to Montana". :)
2014-03-28 20:11:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well the tricky thing about that is my Auburn friend in Chicago is also named Justin
2014-03-28 20:12:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I have two Justins who are pretty close to me and have an Auburn connection
2014-03-28 20:12:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well shit
2014-03-28 20:12:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-03-28 20:13:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Does the Montana one have a last name?
2014-03-28 20:13:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-03-28 20:13:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-03-28 20:13:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-03-28 20:13:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Anderson
2014-03-28 20:13:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]McClain in Chicago
2014-03-28 20:15:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll do my best
2014-03-28 20:15:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Buku is at a good time too
2014-03-28 20:15:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I guess it's a little after your SB
2014-03-28 20:15:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah
2014-03-28 20:15:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's not too far
2014-03-28 20:17:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Justin's planning on going next year, so I would say I'd probably be making the trip in that case
2014-03-28 20:17:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]be a nice final semester present to myself
2014-03-28 20:17:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]assuming I stay on track
2014-03-28 20:18:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll definitely still be on track 
2014-03-28 20:18:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probs with a job lined up already
2014-03-28 20:18:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be niiicccceeee
2014-03-28 20:19:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still a lot to happen before then, though!
2014-03-28 20:20:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hopefully a lot more happy moments with a certain biologist    😉 
2014-03-28 20:20:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you watching this UT UM game?
2014-03-28 20:20:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am!!
2014-03-28 20:20:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Been a boring game up until the last 5 minutes
2014-03-28 20:20:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I know
2014-03-28 20:20:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it didn't seem like it was really a game
2014-03-28 20:23:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuckin time outs
2014-03-28 20:24:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know completely kills it
2014-03-28 20:24:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Clowns. This is ridiculous 
2014-03-28 20:25:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]UT probably should foul
2014-03-28 20:25:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess they have to really
2014-03-28 20:25:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have a dog in the fight?
2014-03-28 20:25:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nailed it
2014-03-28 20:26:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Michigan is who I have going forward
2014-03-28 20:26:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-03-28 20:26:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn that no timeouts thing sucks
2014-03-28 20:27:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they didn't really have a chance
2014-03-28 20:27:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If they had played better in the 1st half they might've 
2014-03-28 20:27:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah that's true
2014-03-28 20:28:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha what a sassy comment 
2014-03-28 20:28:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-28 20:28:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who you got in Kentucky Louisville?
2014-03-28 20:29:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kentucky, just bc they've been playing so well this tourney
2014-03-28 20:29:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't seen a Kentucky game yet I don't think
2014-03-28 20:29:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a fun matchup, though
2014-03-28 20:29:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice and local
2014-03-28 20:29:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gonna get rowdy
2014-03-28 20:33:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With the bracket I made from the sweet 16, I have Iowa state, Florida, Wisconsin, and Michigan
2014-03-28 20:33:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm all aboard the Dayton hype train right now
2014-03-28 20:34:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But Iowa State is about to not pan out
2014-03-28 20:34:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're gonna crack 
2014-03-28 20:34:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha gotta believe!
2014-03-28 20:35:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm a cynic, what can I say
2014-03-28 20:36:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cynic is kinda a weird word to me
2014-03-28 20:36:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or at least its usage
2014-03-28 20:37:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because the first definition in almost any dictionary is something like "a person who believes that people are motivated purely by self-interest rather than acting for honorable or unselfish reasons."  
2014-03-28 20:37:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I almost only hear it used as a synonym for pessimist
2014-03-28 20:37:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like its meaning is evolivng
2014-03-28 20:38:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm, I don't think I even knew that was its official primary definition. I've definitely always thought if it as a skeptical pessimist
2014-03-28 20:38:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's the only way it's used
2014-03-28 20:39:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I've lived long enough now to have witnessed language evolving, and it is pretty near
2014-03-28 20:39:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm guessing it must have been used differently historically
2014-03-28 20:39:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*neat
2014-03-28 20:39:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-03-28 20:39:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in what way?
2014-03-28 20:40:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've seen entirely new words arise ("selfie", shorthand speak like "lol") as well as cases where words have been 'misused' enough that they shift in meaning 
2014-03-28 20:41:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I fell like at least the latter might operate on a generational time scale
2014-03-28 20:42:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I think the Internet allows rapid adoption of new words, but the change in meaning is interesting
2014-03-28 20:42:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you have an example for that one?
2014-03-28 20:44:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well cynic might be one. I guess I have to think a little more to come up with some concrete other examples but my mom (who is a bit of a grammar/language freak) is always going on about how words are misused in the newspaper and advertisements 
2014-03-28 20:44:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-03-28 20:44:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I should say cynic isn't being misused, though
2014-03-28 20:45:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the "pessimist" synonym is just typically listed as a later definition
2014-03-28 20:45:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if at all
2014-03-28 20:45:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It sounds like it's being generalized 
2014-03-28 20:45:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it seems like its primary usage is being changed
2014-03-28 20:45:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-03-28 20:48:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one of my favorite things about Southern culture is that it seems like a lot more people participate in music
2014-03-28 20:48:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least Deep South/Southeast
2014-03-28 20:48:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seemed like everyone tried to play something at Auburn
2014-03-28 20:49:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Certainly more in acoustic kind of music, or music with instruments. I feel like the NE and at least Miami a lot of ppl in my generation are really getting into buying midis and playing around with music that way
2014-03-28 20:50:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess that's a really enabling thing
2014-03-28 20:50:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]controllers don't sound great without power, unfortunately
2014-03-28 20:50:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I have to admit I'm biased between playing music and playing around with someone else's sounds
2014-03-28 20:50:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-28 20:50:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-03-28 20:50:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]biased in the direction of making music?
2014-03-28 20:51:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or I guess physically making the sounds
2014-03-28 20:51:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously :)
2014-03-28 20:51:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure if that's even appropriate
2014-03-28 20:51:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I figured
2014-03-28 20:52:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like playing music, but the best thing for me is playing with people
2014-03-28 20:53:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm telling you, it's the music gene! Haha music = bringing people together = improved social structure = better at surviving life
2014-03-28 20:53:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-28 20:53:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not inherently social, though
2014-03-28 20:54:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it is
2014-03-28 20:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a lot of electronic music is made by individuals
2014-03-28 20:55:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I can think of some pretty anti-social "shredders"
2014-03-28 20:55:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you can also enjoy doing it by yourself/practicing to be better with people. BUT electronic music is made to be enjoyed and appreciated by others
2014-03-28 20:55:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think so?
2014-03-28 20:55:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think they're making it for other people?
2014-03-28 20:56:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They do it because they enjoy it, but why would you post your song or w/e if you didn't think other people would appreciate it?
2014-03-28 20:56:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Same thing with shredders who play alone but upload a YouTube video 
2014-03-28 20:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess... but that applies to any creative endeavor
2014-03-28 20:57:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or anything a person works hard on
2014-03-28 20:57:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because they love it
2014-03-28 20:57:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's not really music exclusive
2014-03-28 20:57:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not necessarily. I think most creative endeavors are efforts of communication outside of language. 
2014-03-28 20:58:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But celebrating success from a job well done is a little different 
2014-03-28 20:58:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-03-28 20:58:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm thinking like
2014-03-28 20:58:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]someone makes a kick ass chair
2014-03-28 20:58:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and shows their friends
2014-03-28 20:58:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and their friends all really dig that chair
2014-03-28 20:58:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]basically the same thing right?
2014-03-28 21:00:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I disagree, unless the chair-maker has certain emotions or thoughts associated with that chair he was trying to convey. That's how music/visual arts/literature differ
2014-03-28 21:01:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting, I guess I'm losing sight of the debate here
2014-03-28 21:01:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and wasn't a big part of modern art simply the process of creating?
2014-03-28 21:02:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and not necessarily it being about some meaning
2014-03-28 21:02:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-03-28 21:02:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I said
2014-03-28 21:02:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think there are multiple elements being discussed here
2014-03-28 21:02:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is muddying the waters form e
2014-03-28 21:03:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah but even in creating you are expressing a part of your psyche that might be difficult to convey in every day conversations
2014-03-28 21:03:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yes, maybe a conversation to be revisited not over text lol
2014-03-28 21:03:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you can do that making a chair    😉 
2014-03-28 21:04:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then you are trying to convey something! Even if it is not deliberately conscious 
2014-03-28 21:04:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahahaha
2014-03-28 21:04:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have no idea what we're debating
2014-03-28 21:05:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I think we are slightly on the same side just approaching it from different angles 
2014-03-28 21:05:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can dig that
2014-03-28 21:05:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dig you 
2014-03-28 21:05:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]melting my heart
2014-03-28 21:07:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's light out super late here
2014-03-28 21:07:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's pushing my dinner time back
2014-03-28 21:09:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I ate so much candy in the past 24 hours
2014-03-28 21:10:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-28 21:10:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-03-28 21:10:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, candy when tripping on acid is pretty crazy 
2014-03-28 21:10:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what kind?
2014-03-28 21:10:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not really sure if I've eaten while mid-trip
2014-03-28 21:10:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jolly ranchers
2014-03-28 21:11:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I ever have an appetite
2014-03-28 21:11:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gushers
2014-03-28 21:11:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can see those being pretty interesting
2014-03-28 21:11:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fruity tasty things that feel like they fill up your entire head lol
2014-03-28 21:11:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha interesting
2014-03-28 21:11:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll have to give those a try next time
2014-03-28 21:22:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, it's crazy how mainstream like rave culture is now
2014-03-28 21:22:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm watching the Ultra stream
2014-03-28 21:22:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's like sex!!!
2014-03-28 21:22:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]drugs!!
2014-03-28 21:23:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha yeah, Ultra may signal the end of raving as a counter culture movement 
2014-03-28 21:24:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which may not be a terrible, I'm not sure
2014-03-28 21:24:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it died as a count culture movement several years ago
2014-03-28 21:24:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]once high schoolers were into it
2014-03-28 21:24:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True, ultra was like that 3 years ago, but not as much 4
2014-03-28 21:24:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-03-28 21:24:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm trying to think when I first noticed
2014-03-28 21:25:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was probably 2010
2014-03-28 21:25:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when I noticed how young the crowd was at electronic music fests
2014-03-28 21:25:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's kinda weird to me
2014-03-28 21:25:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it's not really about the music
2014-03-28 21:25:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess that's always the case with this fests and teenagers
2014-03-28 21:26:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no this
2014-03-28 21:26:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm generalizing a bit obviously
2014-03-28 21:27:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess electronic music and drugs are sort of tied together more than any other genre, though
2014-03-28 21:27:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's more about the experience I suppose
2014-03-28 21:28:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, it's more about getting 'fucked up'. I definitely thought about that a bit last night, like why are some humans drawn towards pushing their selves so far out of the norm?
2014-03-28 21:28:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you count marijuana as a drug, it's tied in to a number of other genres
2014-03-28 21:29:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do
2014-03-28 21:29:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess weed and hip hop go together
2014-03-28 21:29:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Explicitly through lyrics or implicitly through the people who listen to it
2014-03-28 21:29:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't think it really defines other genres
2014-03-28 21:29:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Willie Nelson?
2014-03-28 21:29:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jazz
2014-03-28 21:29:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no way for jazz
2014-03-28 21:29:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jazz is historically all drugs
2014-03-28 21:30:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]musicians do drugs
2014-03-28 21:30:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's not a defining part of experincing the music
2014-03-28 21:30:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]90% of the audience isn't gonna be fucked up at a jazz show
2014-03-28 21:30:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like remove drugs from electronic music
2014-03-28 21:30:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who goes to those shows still?
2014-03-28 21:30:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Certainly not necessary, but I bet more people are stoned at a jazz concert than you'd expect
2014-03-28 21:31:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a different kind of culture for sure 
2014-03-28 21:31:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-03-28 21:31:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even just being a little stoned
2014-03-28 21:31:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is still different from the electronic scene
2014-03-28 21:32:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where it's about being outside your mind
2014-03-28 21:33:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking about this earlier a bit
2014-03-28 21:33:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's like the music is a stimulus
2014-03-28 21:33:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for your experience
2014-03-28 21:33:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is the focus
2014-03-28 21:33:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your experience is the focus
2014-03-28 21:33:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where any other genre
2014-03-28 21:33:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](for me)
2014-03-28 21:33:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the music is the focus
2014-03-28 21:36:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, one could argue for other genres, the music is an experience unto it self, but that's just me being an obnoxious debater haha. I actually agree that for the most part (and certainly for festivals like ultra) it is 87% experience 
2014-03-28 21:36:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*91%
2014-03-28 21:36:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-03-28 21:38:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess if a culture is gonna hit the mainstream, I'd rather it be one that promotes love and happiness
2014-03-28 21:39:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I should say "I'm glad" and not "I'd rather"
2014-03-28 21:40:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]PLUR and all that jazz
2014-03-28 21:40:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I had to look that up
2014-03-28 21:40:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yeah
2014-03-28 21:41:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you start a coursera course whenever, or only in the start date?
2014-03-28 21:41:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it depends
2014-03-28 21:42:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what course are you looking at?
2014-03-28 21:42:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]some of them leave the materials up after the fact
2014-03-28 21:42:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]others close the course when its over
2014-03-28 21:42:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*it's
2014-03-28 21:43:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This 4 week one on R or a bioinformatics one
2014-03-28 21:44:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Might be a good summer thing
2014-03-28 21:45:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I don't know. Different classes do different things.
2014-03-28 21:45:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Some of them take down the materials once it's over.
2014-03-28 21:45:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I can always click on them and find out for myself lol
2014-03-28 21:45:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah
2014-03-28 21:45:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if the one is being offered now
2014-03-28 21:45:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would register
2014-03-28 21:46:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then if they leave the materials up after the fact
2014-03-28 21:46:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'll be able to access them still
2014-03-28 21:46:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you won't be able to get a certificate
2014-03-28 21:46:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm guessing that doesn't really matter for you
2014-03-28 21:46:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-28 21:46:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I don't really care abt that lol, I'd just hate for them to disappear before I was done
2014-03-28 21:47:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does my typing pattern bother you
2014-03-28 21:47:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-03-28 21:47:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just noticing how it's kinda strange
2014-03-28 21:48:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What???
2014-03-28 21:48:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I don't even know if it's noticeable
2014-03-28 21:48:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I type like I talk
2014-03-28 21:48:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I send messages where I pause
2014-03-28 21:48:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even if it's not a complete thought
2014-03-28 21:48:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like that
2014-03-28 21:49:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It feels much more natural
2014-03-28 21:49:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just can't type that fast on my phone
2014-03-28 21:49:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I dig
2014-03-28 21:49:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just never really noticed it before
2014-03-28 21:49:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now I'm gonna e hyper aware of it
2014-03-28 21:49:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have zero issue with it
2014-03-28 21:49:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's gonna ruin everything
2014-03-28 21:49:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh shit!
2014-03-28 21:50:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]isn't laziness weird
2014-03-28 21:50:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still haven't made my dinner
2014-03-28 21:50:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I don't feel like getting up off the couch
2014-03-28 21:50:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like what the fuck is that
2014-03-28 21:51:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can totally hear you saying that and chuckling haha. You have a pretty great chuckle.
2014-03-28 21:51:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Butttt you should probably eat
2014-03-28 21:52:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I ate about 8 Oreos earlier
2014-03-28 21:53:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna make you some Oreo balls, and you might just die of happiness
2014-03-28 21:53:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]eff yeah
2014-03-28 21:53:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd rather delay the dying part, though
2014-03-28 21:55:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe Oreo balls + sex
2014-03-28 21:55:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then die
2014-03-28 21:55:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True, I wouldn't want to mail them and have you drop dead before so get to see you again
2014-03-28 22:23:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Christopher Nolan is executive producer on Transcendence
2014-03-28 22:23:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I said he was director
2014-03-28 22:23:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you watch the trail or?
2014-03-28 22:23:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*trailor
2014-03-28 22:23:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not yet
2014-03-28 22:24:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just saw Christopher Nolan was directing Interstellar
2014-03-28 22:24:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I thought that was interesting that he was doing two sci-fi movies
2014-03-28 22:24:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It takes 2.5 minutes!
2014-03-28 22:24:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I gues he's not
2014-03-28 22:24:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-28 22:24:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll watch it now
2014-03-28 22:24:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You betta
2014-03-28 22:28:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm intrigued
2014-03-28 22:28:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the trailer makes it look like a thriller
2014-03-28 22:28:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with a sci-fi element
2014-03-28 22:28:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which might make it less interesting to me
2014-03-28 22:28:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm sure it'll be interesting
2014-03-28 22:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*entertaining
2014-03-28 22:29:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a trailer, they have to hype the suspense part
2014-03-28 22:29:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I thought about that too
2014-03-28 22:29:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll probably see it either way
2014-03-28 22:32:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure how they're going to convince me that the woman believes the computer A.I. is actually Johnny Depp's character
2014-03-28 22:33:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Grief can do some interesting things to perceptions of reality 
2014-03-28 22:33:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And by interesting I mean powerful
2014-03-28 22:33:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the trailer makes it look like she's an A.I. researcher, though
2014-03-28 22:34:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'll just suspend my disbelief
2014-03-28 22:34:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I try not to be too nitpicky
2014-03-28 22:37:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I might be drifting, this large format beer is a lot on top of no sleep haha. So if I don't say it before I pass out, good night darling 
2014-03-28 22:38:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know what a large format beer is
2014-03-28 22:39:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and addressing me with an endearing word?
2014-03-28 22:39:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]milestone!
2014-03-28 22:40:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Usually greater than 20 oz with a high abv
2014-03-28 22:40:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was a little hesitant, not sure if we reached that stage yet 
2014-03-28 22:41:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, well I'm glad you did    😃 
2014-03-28 22:42:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just avoid calling me baby if possible, I guess I have a similar stigma as with "cute"
2014-03-28 22:42:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had a feeling
2014-03-28 22:42:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not sure what I'll use
2014-03-28 22:42:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]might have to stick with Katie
2014-03-28 22:42:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll take it
2014-03-28 22:42:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-28 22:43:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-03-28 22:44:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do feel like there's something I should call you that's different
2014-03-28 22:44:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-03-28 22:44:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll figure it out
2014-03-28 22:44:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like something that's my way of addressing you, you know?
2014-03-28 22:45:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]buttt maybe I'm just overthinking it
2014-03-28 22:45:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I'm sure it'll come naturally 
2014-03-28 22:45:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah no doubt
2014-03-28 22:46:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I realize how awkward it is to be talking about that now
2014-03-28 22:46:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not like feels awkward
2014-03-28 22:46:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but is kinda forced
2014-03-28 22:46:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's silly, not awkward
2014-03-29 12:55:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's rainy and I can't go to the beach :/
2014-03-29 12:55:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's just sad
2014-03-29 12:55:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]any backup plans?
2014-03-29 12:57:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just got some excellent Cuban food, but I think I'm gonna try to do some work before going out tonight. 
2014-03-29 12:58:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which is totally lame I know
2014-03-29 12:59:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]eh, gotta do what ya gotta do
2014-03-29 12:59:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you head back to Chicago tomorrow I guess?
2014-03-29 13:00:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Monday actually, it was like $100 cheaper
2014-03-29 13:00:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, usually the case
2014-03-29 13:00:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss my bed though
2014-03-29 13:01:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the cat
2014-03-29 13:01:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw
2014-03-29 13:02:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This little turd is doing a pretty good job of filling in for her though 
2014-03-29 13:03:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I can respect his location choice
2014-03-29 13:04:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and damn you're pretty!
2014-03-29 13:04:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha why thank you
2014-03-29 13:06:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more music on the agenda for tonight?
2014-03-29 13:07:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to a show Sunday night until like 5a, so I might go out to some of my favorite downtown bars with some friends  
2014-03-29 13:08:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool, sounds like a good time
2014-03-29 13:09:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I forgot how expensive everything is here though. Especially drinks
2014-03-29 13:09:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more than Chicago?
2014-03-29 13:09:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't get my next stipend until I get back
2014-03-29 13:10:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Def more than Chicago. Like the places I went wed and Thursday had $8 heinekens
2014-03-29 13:10:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And ridiculously priced mixed drinks 
2014-03-29 13:10:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that probably has something to do with the kind of place you're going to, though, right?
2014-03-29 13:11:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like are you comparing similar places?
2014-03-29 13:11:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and wtf are you doing paying for drinks?
2014-03-29 13:11:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A little, the college bars and some diveier places are more like $5 for a cheap beer
2014-03-29 13:12:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I don't usually try to get people to buy drinks for me. There's underlying assumptions there that I don't want to propitiate 
2014-03-29 13:13:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]okay big word
2014-03-29 13:13:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're more noble than I
2014-03-29 13:13:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd exploit the shit out of that
2014-03-29 13:15:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh maybe you would, but dudes can get angry when you take drinks from them and then not go home with them or at least dance with them
2014-03-29 13:15:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I don't really like grinding up on strangers 
2014-03-29 13:16:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, dudes that think buying a drink earns them the right to a dance or anything else are assholes
2014-03-29 13:16:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miami has a lotttt of assholes lol
2014-03-29 13:16:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's why I said I would exploit it, but I guess it might be different if I was a lady having to deal with an angry dude
2014-03-29 13:17:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-03-29 13:19:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I used "that" where I should've used "who" and it's bothering me
2014-03-29 13:19:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-29 13:19:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had to acknowledge it to feel better
2014-03-29 13:20:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jeez I hope you don't get antsy over my frequent misuse of grammar
2014-03-29 13:20:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no
2014-03-29 13:20:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's only with myself for some reason
2014-03-29 13:20:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's good. I know when it's incorrect, I just don't want to take the time on my phone to correct it
2014-03-29 13:20:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for as hard as I try to resist judging other people, I judge myself all the time haha
2014-03-29 13:21:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah no worries
2014-03-29 13:21:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it doesn't bother me at all unless it's my own mistake
2014-03-29 13:21:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Perfectionist
2014-03-29 13:21:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha unfortunately
2014-03-29 13:22:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I used to be a lot worse
2014-03-29 13:22:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's one of those values I think my parents instilled in me that I don't actually value myself
2014-03-29 13:22:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like the hard work thing
2014-03-29 13:23:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't value hard work? Or work for work's sake?
2014-03-29 13:23:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't value hard work for its own sake
2014-03-29 13:23:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you could say I don't value hard work
2014-03-29 13:23:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I value passion
2014-03-29 13:24:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like it when people are excited about things and pursue those things with a passion
2014-03-29 13:24:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's not really hard work
2014-03-29 13:25:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://waitbutwhy.com/2013/09/why-generation-y-yuppies-are-unhappy.html
2014-03-29 13:25:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I read this yesterday, kinda funny and interesting food for thought
2014-03-29 13:27:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I've actually seen that before, I agree with a lot of what it says
2014-03-29 13:28:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the "you're not special" is a big deal for me
2014-03-29 13:29:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-03-29 13:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just recognizing that fact
2014-03-29 13:29:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-03-29 13:29:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sounds kinda negative I guess
2014-03-29 13:30:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]realizing I'm not destined for greatness
2014-03-29 13:30:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is probably better
2014-03-29 13:30:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]greatness in some traditional societal sense
2014-03-29 13:30:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You might be! (But what is destiny) I guess it's important to be able to work through the bullshit to get where you want to be
2014-03-29 13:31:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think our generation struggles with that
2014-03-29 13:31:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, for sure
2014-03-29 13:32:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like we're definitely a lot more disillusioned as a generation than previous
2014-03-29 15:38:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I fell asreep
2014-03-29 15:38:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Post Cuban food nap
2014-03-29 15:42:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]asreep is an odd typo
2014-03-29 15:43:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was intentional
2014-03-29 15:43:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh
2014-03-29 15:43:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like obnoxious cutesy talk I guess lol
2014-03-29 15:43:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-29 15:43:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm trying to pronounce it
2014-03-29 15:43:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get more ashreep
2014-03-29 15:44:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-29 15:44:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I can say it asreep
2014-03-29 15:44:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ass reep? Hahaha
2014-03-29 15:45:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh man
2014-03-29 15:45:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're goofy
2014-03-29 15:48:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Guilty, especially around naps and bedtime 
2014-03-29 15:48:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm noticing!
2014-03-29 15:48:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sleepy Katie can be a strange mothafucker
2014-03-29 15:48:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-29 15:50:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you getting mad work done?
2014-03-29 15:50:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah
2014-03-29 15:50:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]some, thoug
2014-03-29 15:50:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]h
2014-03-29 15:51:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]organizing my thoughts a bit on one of my projects
2014-03-29 15:51:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Always a good first step
2014-03-29 15:53:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what work did you have between quarters?
2014-03-29 15:53:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]actual research stuff?
2014-03-29 15:55:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, a list of things to investigate about these oysters. Like make sure no one else is doing exactly what I want to do, assemble a list of readings for my class with Cathy, send some emails, make a list of grants to apply to, make a detailed range map of the fuckers.
2014-03-29 15:56:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I a fair amount on Tuesday and the plane on Wed so I'm not terribly behind
2014-03-29 15:56:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool, yeah that sounds like a full plate, though
2014-03-29 15:57:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I checked in somewhere on 4square!
2014-03-29 15:57:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha whoooaaaa
2014-03-29 15:57:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how does it feel?!?
2014-03-29 15:57:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like getting little awards
2014-03-29 15:57:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah
2014-03-29 15:58:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]i want to do some data mining on my check-ins some day
2014-03-29 15:58:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's part of my motivation for continuing to do it
2014-03-29 15:58:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and my mom likes knowing what I'm up to
2014-03-29 15:58:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-29 15:58:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Data mining, I love it
2014-03-29 15:59:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I probs won't link it to Facebook
2014-03-29 15:59:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-03-29 15:59:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've actually had people tell me they find it kinda obnoxious
2014-03-29 15:59:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't care
2014-03-29 15:59:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-29 15:59:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want my momma knowing where I am
2014-03-29 15:59:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-29 16:00:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good reason
2014-03-29 16:00:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I don't think it's obnoxious 
2014-03-29 16:00:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just hard to find actual statuses sometimes
2014-03-29 16:00:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know, when I stalk you 
2014-03-29 16:00:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-29 16:00:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-03-29 16:01:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd be nice if there was a way to separate that stuff into its own separate section on Facebook
2014-03-29 16:01:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that'd require the Facebook people actually working towards making a decent product
2014-03-29 16:01:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and their history doesn't make me optimistic
2014-03-29 16:01:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They've slowly been doing that, by ferreting some activities to the left.
2014-03-29 16:01:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But only on the Desktop version
2014-03-29 16:02:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like what activities/
2014-03-29 16:03:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should've used "someday" instead of "some day" earlier
2014-03-29 16:05:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't even know when you said someday
2014-03-29 16:06:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But they put "Recent Activity", Instagram photos, events, music/movie likes
2014-03-29 16:06:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but Instagram stuff still shows up in your main feed too
2014-03-29 16:06:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's still all mixed in with that statuses
2014-03-29 16:08:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess they could make an option for those check ins and stuff to only go on the side 
2014-03-29 16:08:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-03-29 16:08:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I'd like to see
2014-03-29 16:08:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like a Foursquare tab
2014-03-29 16:09:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and all the check-ins show up there
2014-03-29 16:09:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and only there
2014-03-29 16:11:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Going to my favorite sushi place for happy hour tonight :)
2014-03-29 16:12:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice!
2014-03-29 16:12:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so are you actually in Miami right now?
2014-03-29 16:13:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know the lay of the land
2014-03-29 16:13:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]between Coral Gables and Miami
2014-03-29 16:13:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'm in coral gables where the school is, but that's like a 20 min drive to downtown Miami
2014-03-29 16:14:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-03-29 16:14:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-03-29 16:14:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miami area is large but the city itself is kind of compact
2014-03-29 16:15:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Coral gables is like a neighborhood near the Loop in Chicago
2014-03-29 16:15:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the Loop is downtown, though
2014-03-29 16:16:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly
2014-03-29 16:16:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought you said Coral Gables was a 20 min drive to downtown
2014-03-29 16:16:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's like with traffic
2014-03-29 16:16:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, maybe I'm explaining it poorly
2014-03-29 16:16:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm basically in Miami 
2014-03-29 16:17:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-03-29 16:17:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'll just have to take me on a tour someday!
2014-03-29 16:20:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For sure, I'm glad I came back. It really is a beautiful city, just  not  somewhere I'd like to live
2014-03-29 16:20:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why's that?
2014-03-29 16:21:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The people, the prices, the humidity, the superficial vibe
2014-03-29 16:21:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Palm trees are great, but I prefer living around real trees
2014-03-29 16:22:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The food is actually of low diversity, very much not like Chicago 
2014-03-29 16:22:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Art and culture-wise it's meh
2014-03-29 16:23:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds like you got a lot of reasons
2014-03-29 16:23:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]although you mentioned an affinity for the Southeast I thought
2014-03-29 16:23:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and humidity is universal in that region
2014-03-29 16:24:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not like this, where it's allllll the time sweat
2014-03-29 16:24:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess it was like that in Alabama
2014-03-29 16:24:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I like the Carolinas, but that's about it 
2014-03-29 16:25:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I dig
2014-03-29 16:33:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I told my mom about the possibility of us taking the car up, and if that falls through I'll stop by home after Cost Rica and then drive it with my dad. But since I want to book flights soonish, can we set a deadline of like April 11 to figure out what we're gonna do? 
2014-03-29 16:33:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will that be enough time for you?
2014-03-29 16:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you give me a more exact date of when you want to drive up?
2014-03-29 16:34:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my last final is May 12th
2014-03-29 16:36:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess the 14, I have class I can't miss on Tuesdays
2014-03-29 16:37:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, yeah I'm down with committing to that
2014-03-29 16:37:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I only have one exam the previous week
2014-03-29 16:37:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and no classes
2014-03-29 16:37:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I can get all moved out then
2014-03-29 16:38:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What will you do with your stuff, store it? Or ship it to NC?
2014-03-29 16:38:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna store probably 90% of it
2014-03-29 16:39:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]getting to NC might be a bit of a scramble
2014-03-29 16:39:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's all good
2014-03-29 16:40:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're internship starts the 19? 
2014-03-29 16:41:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-03-29 16:42:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you can double check to make sure you can get there from Chicago in time before I book a flight :)
2014-03-29 16:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll have to leave that Saturday
2014-03-29 16:43:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fly to Dallas I guess
2014-03-29 16:43:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know
2014-03-29 16:43:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it depends on my car situation
2014-03-29 16:43:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll talk to my parents
2014-03-29 16:43:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really want this to happen, though
2014-03-29 16:44:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm down with it being kinda tough on me
2014-03-29 16:46:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you can buy a car in NC? I dunno, I'd rather maximize time spent with you, even if that meant not driving with you
2014-03-29 16:46:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-03-29 16:46:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like what alternative are you imagining?
2014-03-29 17:01:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm at dinner but we can talk about it later :)
2014-03-29 17:02:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]alright, enjoy!
2014-03-29 19:26:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I could fly in and stay with you until you have to leave and then drive up to chicago myself?
2014-03-29 19:55:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well... if I have a car, and we're just maximizing time, I could drive up to Chicago the day of my exam. And then you could still drive up with your dad. I don't know, my car situation is a big variable. I'm gonna video chat with my mom tomorrow, so hopefully I'll have a better idea then.
2014-03-29 19:59:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok no big rush! And if we don't get to drive together, I promise we'll find a time to go camping in the future :)
2014-03-29 20:28:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like that promise. As long as I get to see you I'll be happy.
2014-03-29 20:41:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-03-29 20:42:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe while you're video chatting people tomorrow we can chat too. I miss your face 
2014-03-29 20:46:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Goddammit you're sweet. That sounds great, though.
2014-03-29 20:47:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What can I say, you got a nice face
2014-03-29 21:02:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Poor Dayton :(
2014-03-29 21:03:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I only watched the last 5 min
2014-03-29 21:03:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yeah, a bummer for sure
2014-03-29 21:36:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You any good at pool?
2014-03-29 21:36:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] I'm not terrible
2014-03-29 21:36:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm not always consistent 
2014-03-29 21:37:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. Sometimes I'm really on, but I'm playing terrible right now.
2014-03-29 21:39:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like we could either be great together or just cooperatively dismal 
2014-03-29 21:39:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At pool, not dating in general haha
2014-03-29 21:41:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-03-29 22:30:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't think of a pet name to call you. I'm totally intimidated haha. And Katie seems to formal.
2014-03-29 22:30:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*too
2014-03-29 22:30:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude! Next time you see me we can figure it out :)
2014-03-29 22:31:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And since Katie is already a nickname, I think you're ok
2014-03-29 22:33:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha ooook
2014-03-29 23:31:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How's your night going?
2014-03-29 23:58:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I ended up going to a club to see a show. Maceo Plex. It's pretty good :)
2014-03-30 00:00:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Getting your dance on?
2014-03-30 00:44:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know it
2014-03-30 00:45:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight, Katie... wish I could be there with you feeling your body against mine
2014-03-30 02:23:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There would be so much body on body, I don't think I could handle it
2014-03-30 05:22:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hope this isn't TMI, but I definitely just touched myself in the shower while thinking of you. And while it was no where near as good as the real thing, it still felt fucking amazing.
2014-03-30 08:17:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Damnnn that's sexy. I love how turned on you get. You make me feel like a god haha
2014-03-30 08:19:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm crazy about ya :)
2014-03-30 09:28:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I was definitely still rolling a bit when I came home, which helped haha
2014-03-30 09:31:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We definitely need to roll together sometime, it would be too much fun. 
2014-03-30 09:36:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No doubt. I have a feeling it would be very handy haha
2014-03-30 09:37:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Toooo many definitelys 
2014-03-30 09:39:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant to say "handsy", haha
2014-03-30 09:40:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm guess it would be handy for having a good time?
2014-03-30 09:42:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhhh. It would definitely be handsy. And talkative. I don't think I've rolled with someone who I have both such excellent communication chemistry and sexual chemistry with. 
2014-03-30 09:44:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah it would be awesome. I'm getting embarrassed just thinking about all the stuff I would probably say. I literally have zero filter when I'm rolling.
2014-03-30 09:46:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't seem to have much of a filter now
2014-03-30 09:47:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I know, right? But apparently there's still a lot of shit I keep in check.
2014-03-30 10:09:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Today I finally get to take a nap on the beach :)
2014-03-30 10:12:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, yay! Do you have a go-to beach?
2014-03-30 10:12:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's one on the nearest Key that I like, not as crowded as SoBe
2014-03-30 12:42:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to now?
2014-03-30 12:42:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the usual... putting off homework
2014-03-30 12:42:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you?
2014-03-30 12:43:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna head out to the beach in like 20, thought maybe you'd like to chat a little before I go?
2014-03-30 12:43:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sure!
2014-03-30 12:45:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you good to go?
2014-03-30 12:46:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah!
2014-03-30 12:51:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmk call me back
2014-03-30 13:14:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry if I was all over the place haha
2014-03-30 13:16:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah, it was great. That'll probably end up being the best part of my day!
2014-03-30 13:17:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok good :) it'll for sure be a highlight of mine
2014-03-30 13:18:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You should send me a pic of your view at the beach.
2014-03-30 13:19:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I will, maybe even a bikini shot if you're lucky
2014-03-30 13:20:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ooh la la ;)

2014-03-30 13:21:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha you're a nut
2014-03-30 14:07:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like a beautiful day for the beach!
2014-03-30 14:08:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is, not too hot. The Sony Open Tennis tournament is blocking off the part of the beach without seaweed though, bastards
2014-03-30 14:09:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I forgot sunglasses so I'm totes squinty
2014-03-30 14:11:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha still sexy
2014-03-30 14:13:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Clearly not a Floridian anymore forgetting your sunglasses when going to the beach!
2014-03-30 14:13:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah, that's pretty typical for even Floridian Katie
2014-03-30 14:14:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Scatterbrained 
2014-03-30 14:15:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am wearing my thing bottoms, but I don't know of a subtle way to take a pic of them lol
2014-03-30 14:16:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*thong
2014-03-30 14:16:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? I don't think I've ever been to a beach with girls in thongs. But I guess I've never been to a beach in South Florida either.
2014-03-30 14:17:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I'm kindaaaa bummed you put that thought in my brain and can't deliver.
2014-03-30 14:17:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got these in Spain originally, they're a little less common in Miami but still around. I just really don't like tan lines
2014-03-30 14:18:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The best I can do haha
2014-03-30 14:19:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'll do :)
2014-03-30 15:16:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why is your Instagram name Air Alcorn? 
2014-03-30 15:18:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all of my account handles (Twitter, PSN, github, etc.), but it goes back to when I was in like 7th or 8th grade.
2014-03-30 15:19:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Were you a mad bball playa?
2014-03-30 15:19:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was going to the rec center to play some ball, and I wore NY basketball shoes in, and this rec center had this asinine rule where you HAD to carry your basketball shoes in, you couldn't wear them.
2014-03-30 15:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I had my mom take me to Walmart and pick up some really cheap basketball shoes. And I dubbed them the "Air Alcorns" and ended up signing them and letting a friend draw a logo on them (a silhouette of me in football pads with an afro, lol). I ended up rocking them throughout that school year on the regular. Anyway that's where it's from, not very adult, but I like the story.
2014-03-30 15:22:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The 2 was my football number.
2014-03-30 17:40:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Phone died. But I like the story too
2014-03-30 18:14:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Brett seems to have unfollowed me on Twitter
2014-03-30 18:22:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you only have 4square check-ins on there, maybe he didn't care to see those on both twitter and Facebook
2014-03-30 18:23:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was he ever following you?
2014-03-30 18:24:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah he was, I guess he's not following me anymore either
2014-03-30 18:26:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll talk to him when I get back to chicago
2014-03-30 18:27:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean, I can deal with him not wanting to be friends with me anymore.
2014-03-30 18:27:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get it.
2014-03-30 18:27:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't hold any animosity towards him.
2014-03-30 18:28:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm more worried about causing some rift in the department.
2014-03-30 18:30:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess most people in the department are probably beyond picking sides.
2014-03-30 18:30:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And can recognize the complexities of the situation.
2014-03-30 18:38:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean 95% of the dept don't know Brett and I had anything extracurricular going on so I'm not worried about that
2014-03-30 18:39:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well... it's whatever I guess. As long as you're good, I'm good. Just not really used to dealing with this kind of thing.
2014-03-30 18:39:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm worried about him hating me a but
2014-03-30 18:39:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*bit
2014-03-30 18:40:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I honestly think if I explain this is more than just a casual/slutty fling (which is what he indicated he thought it was) then he'll be more accepting 
2014-03-30 18:42:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hope so... but even if he doesn't really change his tune, I think talking to him will at least provide some clarity/closure to the situation.
2014-03-30 18:42:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I guess talking to him is good regardless of the outcome.
2014-03-30 18:44:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]anyyyyywayyyyyyyyyyyy this convo is a bit of a bumme
2014-03-30 18:44:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]r
2014-03-30 18:44:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was the beach, beautiful?
2014-03-30 18:45:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like that nickname :)
2014-03-30 18:45:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah? Me too.
2014-03-30 19:33:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was perfect. I got a little tan, read some GOT, drank 4 beers, and just ate some mad texmex
2014-03-30 19:47:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awesome
2014-03-30 20:13:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And yeah, talking about Brett does kind of bring my mood down I guess. Makes me feel like I put you in this shitty situation you wouldn't be in if I hadn't engaged in a casual relationship that I was already regretting before I even met you
2014-03-30 20:17:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You don't have to feel bad on my behalf. I don't regret anything.
2014-03-30 20:17:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Neither of us knew he would have this kind of response.
2014-03-30 20:18:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might've talked to him about it beforehand if I had realized he would feel this way, but I'm glad I didn't, because I don't know if I would've still went with it had he told me wasn't cool with it.
2014-03-30 20:42:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've got a weird vibe again... let's talk about something else.
2014-03-30 20:43:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I agree, I'm sorry. Can we just not bring it up again until I talk to him about it?
2014-03-30 20:43:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely.
2014-03-30 20:44:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm watching Season 4 of the Office right now with some old frisbee friends now
2014-03-30 20:44:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty chill
2014-03-30 20:44:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word.
2014-03-30 20:44:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why season 4
2014-03-30 20:44:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-03-30 20:45:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's what they have on DVD haha
2014-03-30 20:45:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright, I thought that seemed oddly specific
2014-03-30 20:45:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-30 20:45:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I talked to my parents a bit today
2014-03-30 20:46:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my dad thinks I should get a car
2014-03-30 20:46:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he said he'd help out
2014-03-30 20:46:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he wants me to figure out where I'll be living in NC first I guess
2014-03-30 20:47:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but, if that happens
2014-03-30 20:47:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'll have the car before you come down
2014-03-30 20:47:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or before you were planning on coming down
2014-03-30 20:47:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sooo
2014-03-30 20:47:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know how we'll want to do things in that case
2014-03-30 20:47:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll talk to him more about it this week.
2014-03-30 20:48:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I need to hug you right now    😞 
2014-03-30 20:49:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Awwww don't be all sad face 
2014-03-30 20:49:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok    😀 
2014-03-30 20:49:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I would obviously love a hug
2014-03-30 20:49:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]From you specifically 
2014-03-30 21:04:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should get a car. And then drive up to chicago after your exam, and then drive to NC from Chicago. I'll help pay for the gas since you're going so far out of the way. And then I'll get my car after Costa Rica
2014-03-30 21:05:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds good. I'll get working on that.
2014-03-30 21:06:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A plan!
2014-03-30 21:07:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha indeed
2014-03-30 21:07:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd be nice if my last exam wasn't so late
2014-03-30 21:07:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe we can ask him to move it up
2014-03-30 21:07:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll email him
2014-03-30 21:07:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just loled
2014-03-30 21:08:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Make a convincing argument
2014-03-30 21:08:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That I need you in my bed at a reasonable hour
2014-03-30 21:08:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha, yessss
2014-03-30 21:09:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I totally didn't mean you and I when I said "we"
2014-03-30 21:09:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I know
2014-03-30 21:09:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-03-30 21:09:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was hilarious either way
2014-03-30 21:09:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean I'm still gonna email him
2014-03-30 21:09:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-30 21:10:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good vibes are baaaaaack
2014-03-30 21:11:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you ever bought the Velveta shells and cheese package dinner?
2014-03-30 21:12:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No because I'm not a 13 year old boy 
2014-03-30 21:13:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahahaha
2014-03-30 21:13:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're killing me
2014-03-30 21:14:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]anywayyy
2014-03-30 21:14:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it delicious?
2014-03-30 21:14:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it has this stupid fucking insert thumb thing
2014-03-30 21:15:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you just end up bending the shit out of the corner
2014-03-30 21:15:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like why even put it there
2014-03-30 21:15:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not hard to tear the box open
2014-03-30 21:15:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's what I end up doing anyway
2014-03-30 21:15:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and yes it's fucking delicious
2014-03-30 21:15:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll eat the whole box of it
2014-03-30 21:16:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1080 calories
2014-03-30 21:16:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-30 21:20:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fatty
2014-03-30 21:21:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]something like that
2014-03-30 21:21:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm still laughing at that 13-year-old comment
2014-03-30 21:21:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no mercy, man
2014-03-30 21:22:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and speaking of fatty, I almost sent you a post-gym no shirt pic today to reciprocate your generosity... but I chickened out cuz I felt like a goober
2014-03-30 21:22:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What??? Why not??
2014-03-30 21:23:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm so upset now
2014-03-30 21:23:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm sorry!
2014-03-30 21:23:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]next time
2014-03-30 21:23:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I took the pic and everything
2014-03-30 21:23:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even had hashtags thought up
2014-03-30 21:24:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#NotAtTheBeach
2014-03-30 21:24:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if you took the pic you can still send it... :)
2014-03-30 21:24:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]deleted it, lol
2014-03-30 21:26:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm this gives me an excuse to see if I can recover deleted files, though!
2014-03-30 21:32:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like it's possible, but more effort than I'm willing to put into it at the moment.
2014-03-30 21:46:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll just have to take another one and not chicken out 
2014-03-30 21:46:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm getting ready with da ladies, definitely missed that kind of fun high estrogen stuff
2014-03-30 21:48:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah... I guess that kinda stuff probably doesn't happen as often for you these days
2014-03-30 21:48:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess I'll let you go so can enjoy the moment!
2014-03-30 21:49:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have a fun night
2014-03-30 21:50:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well the cat and I get pumped up when getting ready to go out, but it's not quite the same 
2014-03-30 21:50:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks, I'll talk to you later!
2014-03-31 02:22:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's official. We're taking a trip here at some point (when we both have $$ and time lol). Cause I just keep thinking about how much you'd enjoy this ish and how much I want you here
2014-03-31 05:46:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you wake up- what are your thoughts on me kissing a woman? You don't care, you feel like I'm cheating, you think it's super sexy...? I didn't this evening, butttt I was dancing with this girl/lady/woman/whatever and the thought crossed my mind
2014-03-31 05:48:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I have some mild bicuriousness lol,  especially  when rolling 
2014-03-31 05:51:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which obvs I did this evening, given these wordy random texts 
2014-03-31 05:52:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And am definitely still rolling, meaning I almost certainly won't sleep before I get on the plane at 11a
2014-03-31 05:55:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Soooo maybe I'll just keep texting you embarrassing streams of consciousness for you to wake up too :)
2014-03-31 05:58:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like how I definitely<-(last time I'm allowed to use that word for the foreseeable future) had to censor myself from texting you about my feelings for you throughout the night
2014-03-31 05:59:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like my brain has this strong association between increased serotonin levels and you
2014-03-31 06:11:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm definitely walking around campus barefoot and in pjs without a bra. I think I look slightly homeless
2014-03-31 06:13:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I went out to see the sunrise without shoes and realized I couldn't see it in front of their house and just started walking.
2014-03-31 06:13:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But honestly I'm kinda loving it
2014-03-31 06:51:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Campus sunset
2014-03-31 07:07:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I debated bringing some Molly back to Chicago, for a festival this summer (or something with you), but this stuff is wayy speedy. 
2014-03-31 07:07:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or else it just feels that way because it's my 4th night out doing drugs and my brain is fried 
2014-03-31 07:09:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm rereading these, and I sound absolutely nuts. Please don't get scared away by me being a crackhead lol, or think that I'm always like this when on uppers.
2014-03-31 07:12:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though if it did scare you away, then that might be a sign that we aren't as ridiculously compatible as I thought
2014-03-31 07:17:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which would be unfortunate but certainly more believable than the fairy tale-esque-ness that's been going on so far :)
2014-03-31 07:19:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anywayssss, kind of a bummer tangent 
2014-03-31 07:20:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So my ears have almost certainly suffered permanent hearing loss. Like this is a level of fuzziness I've never experienced before, and things sound higher pitched than they actually are
2014-03-31 07:22:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I totally used the word "definitely" like 2 messages after I said I wouldn't. 
2014-03-31 07:23:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I suffered permanent brain damage too? 0_o
2014-03-31 07:52:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now trying to decide what music to listen to on this hour long bus ride I'm about to take. I feel like choosing music after a show or festival is always kinda tricky. 
2014-03-31 07:53:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You want something drastically different than what was just blasting in your ears for 6 hours, but that's the only music you can think of cause it's so stuck in your head
2014-03-31 07:56:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm feeling like the ol Bright Eyes or James Blake fall back may be the play
2014-03-31 07:56:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or Postal Service, who also have some of my favorite songs ever
2014-03-31 07:59:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just remembered you're an hour ahead (duh), so you probably won't be waking up anytime soon like I hoped
2014-03-31 08:01:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This "typing out almost every thought in my head" deal is alright, but it would certainly be nicer to get some interaction with you. 
2014-03-31 08:01:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then maybe this will sound less crazy...
2014-03-31 08:01:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So wake up!
2014-03-31 08:15:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good morning, sunshine!
2014-03-31 08:15:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like jazz after a night like yours.
2014-03-31 08:16:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Now give me a second to catch up.
2014-03-31 08:19:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha that was amazing
2014-03-31 08:19:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like the pictures of your "campus sunset" ;)
2014-03-31 08:21:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A lot of interesting thoughts...
2014-03-31 08:22:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Let me just work my way through here.
2014-03-31 08:26:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1. I would love to take a trip with you to Miami. I also really like how you reference indeterminate points in our future. And I absolutely love that you've been texting me throughout the night during your break without me even prompting you to do so. It's exactly the kind of thing that makes me happy, and you are just being yourself (although, the MDMA might have something to do with it!)
2014-03-31 08:26:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Haha ok. Also, update from the last time you heard from cracked out Katie, she realized that she left her ID at the bar last night and so now had to have an ex-boyfriend she hasn't spoken to in 9 months drive her there. 
2014-03-31 08:27:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-31 08:27:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awesome
2014-03-31 08:27:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah I actually feel prettyyyy stupid, especially if I miss this flight.
2014-03-31 08:27:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah, shit
2014-03-31 08:28:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hope you make it
2014-03-31 08:30:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anyways, I'll address your addresses as you address them
2014-03-31 08:32:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2. The kissing a woman thing is interesting! Probably a topic that would best be discussed in person. My thoughts on "cheating" I guess are fairly complex at this point in my life. I would never cheat on you, but I don't want you to ever feel trapped. I do find the kissing a woman thing sexy, but why should that be different from you wanting to kiss a man? etc.
2014-03-31 08:32:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That will probably need revisited at a future date!
2014-03-31 08:33:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]3. I'm digging the serotonin level comments and I'm sorry you felt like you had to censor yourself, but I also can relate    😃 
2014-03-31 08:34:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]4. lol at walking around looking like a homeless person, that's how you know it was a good night.
2014-03-31 08:34:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]5. I love that you sent me pictures of the sunrise    😃 
2014-03-31 08:35:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]6. If you don't have an MDMA connection in Chicago, I could probably get some from my friend Dar (the guy who went to high school in Plano)
2014-03-31 08:36:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]1. I was actually a little retroactively worried about the "making intermediate plans" thing, as that might be jumping the gun a little or raising expectations too high. But it is a reflection of how excited I am about this new thing with you and confidence that we may actually get to do these things one day :)
2014-03-31 08:38:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]1b. And I'm actually a pretty notorious drunk/whatever texter. If I'm thinking about someone, I'll almost certainly text them. And I definitely wasn't just thinking about you bc of the mdma 
2014-03-31 08:39:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]1c. That said, I also appreciate how you don't get pushy/put out if I don't text you all the time. That's important to me too
2014-03-31 08:40:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]7. I'm pretty sure you do more drugs than anyone I've ever been close to, lol. I love that you play hard and live your life to the fullest, but my only worry is that there is simply no way I can keep up with you, haha
2014-03-31 08:41:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]8. I worry about hear loss a lot. I actually started wearing earplugs to shows briefly. It's probably something I should consider doing again. My hearing is important to me!
2014-03-31 08:41:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]9. I hope there's no brain damage! That'd bum me out.
2014-03-31 08:42:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]10. I think we're caught up. Like I said, I love some jazz after a crazy night.
2014-03-31 08:47:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]2. I can avoid kissing anyone other than my cat until we have that conversation lol. Though I will just say that I think my concept of cheating is kind of complex too. Like it's more the intent/emotional connection aspect that would be an issue for me. Like if you kissed someone purely for ridiculous fun  (even if there's some attraction component too) I don't think I'd be upset 
2014-03-31 08:49:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How many more likes can she fit in a sentence!
2014-03-31 08:50:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-31 08:50:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But that's interesting... like would you know the intent/emotional connection? Is there a physical act that goes to far?
2014-03-31 08:50:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*how would you know
2014-03-31 09:02:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I guess you would be honest with me and say like, yo I kissed this girl and now I like her haha. And I guess sex with someone else would probably be hurtful to an extent, butttt I feel like if it was a drunken mistake (not that I imagine you would do that) and it didn't happen like all the time I would probably forgive that 
2014-03-31 09:03:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it's more honesty, about feelings and actions, than physical infidelity that I care about
2014-03-31 09:04:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we agree on that... I guess the thing is, something like that would change how you view the relationship
2014-03-31 09:04:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]11. I got my id back!
2014-03-31 09:04:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sweet
2014-03-31 09:04:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now make that flight
2014-03-31 09:05:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and... even if we are both forgiving or whatever
2014-03-31 09:05:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think that might "break" something that wouldn't really be possible to get bakc
2014-03-31 09:05:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe not
2014-03-31 09:05:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but, like I said, my biggest thing is I just would never want you to feel trapped
2014-03-31 09:06:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't want you not living your life because of me
2014-03-31 09:06:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean I'm not planning on sleeping with anyone else, but I guess I feel like it would break trust if anything.
2014-03-31 09:07:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't necessarily see it as simply trust, though
2014-03-31 09:07:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like you could tell me
2014-03-31 09:07:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm going to sleep with this dude
2014-03-31 09:07:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and there would be nothing dishonest about it
2014-03-31 09:07:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'd still have a response to it
2014-03-31 09:07:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I'm being honest with myself
2014-03-31 09:08:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd probably be livid
2014-03-31 09:08:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-31 09:08:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and old Michael would have probably made that very known to both you and the guy
2014-03-31 09:08:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I wouldn't do that now
2014-03-31 09:08:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that wouldn't change the fact I'd have that visceral response
2014-03-31 09:08:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it would undeniably change my perception of you
2014-03-31 09:08:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even if that's not fair
2014-03-31 09:09:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or whatever
2014-03-31 09:09:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I had a 2nd point to that comment. -> And trust inherently might mean more defined rules that are alluded to here
2014-03-31 09:09:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even if I didn't want it to
2014-03-31 09:09:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-03-31 09:11:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this kind of "openness" to talk about this kind of thing is something I  reallllyyy like about you
2014-03-31 09:11:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's a big reason we've been able to sort of "move fast" emotionally
2014-03-31 09:21:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In this particular conversational case, it probably is being aided in openness by drugs and exhaustion haha. I know that the way I feel about cheating is a little more lax than most and would've probably waited a bit to bring it up in case it freaked you out or w/e. But, now that we've talked about it I know how you'd feel if that ever happened
2014-03-31 09:21:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah I guess I forgot about the drugs thing
2014-03-31 09:23:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-03-31 09:23:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I already feel like I've put some sort of constraint on the relationship now
2014-03-31 09:23:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But like that conversation we had late the last night you stayed at my place and other more sober conversations, those have been pretty refreshingly open and not really like how most other relationships of mine started
2014-03-31 09:24:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Constraint is ok, if it's what will make you happy :)
2014-03-31 09:25:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or rather, keep you from being really sad/angry
2014-03-31 09:25:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ehhh, but what would make me the most unhappy is you feeling trapped and resenting me for it
2014-03-31 09:25:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess just don't ever not do something because you're afraid of how I will react
2014-03-31 09:25:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what's most important to me
2014-03-31 09:26:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if it hurts me, that's fine. I'd rather deal with that than holding you back from living your life.
2014-03-31 09:26:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I somehow meet some man more perfect than you, then I'll leave you and marry him bc he must be my soul mate
2014-03-31 09:26:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-31 09:26:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good
2014-03-31 09:26:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's exactly what I want to hear
2014-03-31 09:27:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and just to be clear, this only applies to dudes
2014-03-31 09:27:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And as for sleeping around, you've probably already realized I really don't like casual sex situations at all. Historically they've ended up hurting me or making me feel like I'm only worthwhile for my body, which sucks
2014-03-31 09:28:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha so now not only can I kiss a woman, I can sleep with her too? ;)
2014-03-31 09:30:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, well I guess I meant physical intimacy in any regard, but yeah my brain seems to be pretty okay with that
2014-03-31 09:30:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and by okay, I mean really turned on
2014-03-31 09:30:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-31 09:30:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you've mentioned how you don't normally sleep/kiss people you've just met, but I wasn't sure how much of that was just to make me feel better about the situation
2014-03-31 09:30:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-31 09:30:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't gonna judge you either way
2014-03-31 09:37:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've def kissed many more 'strangers' that we're female than male haha, but I especially can't imagine sleeping with someone I've just met. It sounds icky and mildly risky
2014-03-31 09:39:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I think we should be okay on that front then
2014-03-31 09:40:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And as for the double standard, that actually is kind of interesting. Bc then it's almost like a macho "I'm the only man in this cave" kinda deal, where as sleeping with a woman turns you on so it's ok?
2014-03-31 09:40:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's completely a double standard
2014-03-31 09:40:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-31 09:40:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I fully recognize it
2014-03-31 09:41:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I could switch off that aspect of my personality I would
2014-03-31 09:42:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well that's rationalizing morals(what is "acceptable" behavior in a relationship) with instincts
2014-03-31 09:42:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well, that's why I said you shouldn't not do anything because of me
2014-03-31 09:42:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I recognize it's a double standard
2014-03-31 09:43:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is why I'm not making the rule you can't sleep/kiss anyone
2014-03-31 09:43:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I won't react the same way
2014-03-31 09:43:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just how I'm wired
2014-03-31 09:43:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have it told you I had a short fling with a girl before? I might not have yet...
2014-03-31 09:43:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have
2014-03-31 09:45:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I actually kinda liked her, as a person. Butttt I was figuring things out with a boyfriend at the time and while he said he didn't care if it continued (probs cause he thought he'd get a 3some out of it), I ended things cause it felt more like cheating to me than if I had randomly hooked up with a dude during that time 
2014-03-31 09:46:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is sort of a male/female thing, though
2014-03-31 09:46:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like this has been studied
2014-03-31 09:47:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]women are typically more upset by the emotional aspect of cheating
2014-03-31 09:47:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and men are typically more upset by the physical part
2014-03-31 09:47:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so this all makes sense from a scientific point-of-view
2014-03-31 11:04:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry phone died right before take off, but I've charged it and bought some wifi
2014-03-31 11:04:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Partially to continue this conversation and partially to get some jazz tunes :)
2014-03-31 11:08:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes it makes sense from an instinctual point of view, but what's the point if being human if we can't overcome our instincts with logic? 
2014-03-31 11:09:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woah that sticker was way bigger than I intended
2014-03-31 11:12:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anyways, now I'm just being argumentative about the principle haha, I'm not gonna sleep with anyone. I will probably dance with dudes occasionally though, mostly my friends but every once in a while if I'm in the mood and find someone who's a good dance partner I'm gonna get my boogie on
2014-03-31 11:13:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha and I guess I don't really know about the logic thing. To me, that's like saying I can logic my way into liking olives or something. I don't know if I really buy into that. But... I've sort of backed off my original remarks. I have no interest in changing who you are. You should just kiss and do whatever with whoever you want, and if I can't deal with it, then we weren't meant to be!
2014-03-31 11:15:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fair enough, but just because I was sort of arguing the point this morning, I don't want you thinking or worrying that every time I'm under the influence of something I'm gonna hook up with someone, cause that's absolutely not the case
2014-03-31 11:17:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's whatever yo! I'm not going to work about it. I guess I'd just appreciate an acknowledgement if it ever does happen.
2014-03-31 11:17:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I mightttt act next time I'm feeling frisky (which just means I'm craving you) and there's a lady around who strikes my fancy :)
2014-03-31 11:17:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously, honesty is my policy dude
2014-03-31 11:18:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*darling
2014-03-31 11:18:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-03-31 11:19:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Soooo moving on to the less contentious points
2014-03-31 11:20:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]3. It is pretty miraculous how only a few days/nights actually in your presence has rewired my brain a bit. 
2014-03-31 11:21:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]3b. As I've been spilling my guts so much lately, I'm a little curious about what you're censoring :)
2014-03-31 11:23:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]4. I definitely ran into some ppl I knew from my job who we're getting off at 8am and had some pretty awkward conversations about what I was doing there 
2014-03-31 11:23:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*were
2014-03-31 11:23:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially since I used to be their supervisor haha
2014-03-31 11:24:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]5. I would love to physically share a sunrise with you at some point
2014-03-31 11:27:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]6. The only person I know in Chicago who might have a connect is Brett, so I may ask you to hit up that friend at some point
2014-03-31 11:31:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]7. After this break, it's gonna be another long while before I indulge again, and probably never to this extreme again. College I definitely partied "harder" than most other people I know, but I also know numerous ppl bad friends at Miami that are on a whole other level from me. So I feel like I'm not as close to the extreme as it may seem. 
2014-03-31 11:33:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't ever feel pressured to "keep up" or that I'll be disappointed if you don't do something like that with me. I'm just happy that you're ok with it (cause the majority of people in the world totally aren't, and I've dated someone who was like that and I felt like I had to hide it or change who I was for him (which obvs never works out))
2014-03-31 11:35:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]8. I was pretty good at wearing ear plugs to clubs junior/senior year, cause they are literally far above damaging levels at inside venues, so I should've known better this week
2014-03-31 11:36:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]9. I'm drinking some red wine and hopefully *fingers crossed* gonna sleep soon. And then we can do a full diagnostic on my mental faculties haha, until then it's probably just exhaustion 
2014-03-31 11:39:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]10. I'm listening to Björk now, but I've got some Sonny Rollins lined up :)
2014-03-31 11:40:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]11. I got on the place with a little time to spare. Car ride with ex was not too awkward (mostly bc I was texting you the whole time and he was half awake, so not much talking)
2014-03-31 11:44:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you're in class right now, correct? Sooo you're not obligated to talk to chatty crackhead me. Don't want to distract you from important learning!
2014-03-31 11:53:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Additional random thought, but I think it's kinda funny and sweet that you like things I post on social media, even if it's something I already sent to you as an exclusive preview 
2014-03-31 12:16:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's the point of being on a social network if you're not gonna engage with the content? And it's the closest thing I've got to PDA haha.
2014-03-31 12:17:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha that's true. 
2014-03-31 12:18:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The PDA part in particular, and I guess I agree with the social media comment, but you can be a passive user (aka a stalker lol)
2014-03-31 12:19:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also band that popped up on Songza you'd probably like- Air
2014-03-31 12:19:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or at least the song I heard was jazzy and all around good music 
2014-03-31 12:41:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you get the track name?
2014-03-31 12:45:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Playground Love
2014-03-31 12:45:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]3b. When we roll together, you're gonna have more uncensored nonsense then you could ever possibly want. It's honestly a little scary to me haha.
2014-03-31 12:47:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well at the rate we're going talking-wise, I feel like there won't be anything I don't know about you or your thoughts by then 
2014-03-31 12:47:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*than
2014-03-31 12:47:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha man you're in for a trip.
2014-03-31 12:48:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It'll probably end up being a relatively big deal I bet.
2014-03-31 12:49:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I guess that'll happen when it happens.
2014-03-31 12:55:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm probably building it up too much haha. Watch it suck.
2014-03-31 12:56:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Turns out I'm doing really well in this Statistics for Machine Learning course that has been kicking my ass.
2014-03-31 12:59:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you have some pretty radical works views/are a crazy conspiracy theorist/actually an axe murderer? I can't imagine what you would talk about that would make a big impact on me that I don't have some inkling of already 
2014-03-31 12:59:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*world views
2014-03-31 13:00:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice! Thank goodness too, I can't date someone who gets below an A
2014-03-31 13:00:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mothers rule 
2014-03-31 13:01:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha no. Nothing like that I don't think. I guess we'll just see what happens. I honestly can't predict what I'll want to talk about. I'll probably be obnoxiously gushy.
2014-03-31 13:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well I got a 3.5 last semester, so I guess I've blown it already.
2014-03-31 13:10:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You get a semester on probation, just get your act together! And don't give me that " grades don't matter" bullshit
2014-03-31 13:11:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha this is a pretty lame joke, but it's cracking me up right now
2014-03-31 13:13:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't nap on the plane, and now I'm in Detroit for like 3 hours. Sooo I guess I'm gonna find a spot to chilllll
2014-03-31 13:13:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol you're a nut yo
2014-03-31 13:14:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sounds good.
2014-03-31 13:14:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've been hearing this phrase a lot lately. Hopefully being a nut is an endearing thing? 
2014-03-31 13:15:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Very!
2014-03-31 13:18:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just talking to my buddy who is from Spring around Houston. You familiar?
2014-03-31 13:20:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like you've gotten to know me during a peak nuttiness time. Finals stress + reliving my Miami youth 
2014-03-31 13:21:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like you're getting to know me at my most boring, but you still seem to dig me for some reason.
2014-03-31 13:23:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'd prefer to know I like you when you're boring (which I disagree with completely) then be tricked by the exciting, more fleeting version of Michael Alcorn
2014-03-31 13:42:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And yeah I know Spring, like North Houston area
2014-03-31 13:42:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We competed against schools from their in band lol 
2014-03-31 13:43:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*there
2014-03-31 13:44:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I apologize for my grammar and spelling today, it's been particularly atrocious 
2014-03-31 14:00:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha no worries. And I appreciate that you can like boring Michael!
2014-03-31 14:01:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I kinda feel like a crazy person when I describe our relationship.
2014-03-31 14:04:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who have you described it to?
2014-03-31 14:04:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just described it to my friend Shagun
2014-03-31 14:05:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I kinda feel the same way. Or maybe not crazy, but I anticipate skeptical looks.
2014-03-31 14:05:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah that's more accurate
2014-03-31 14:05:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Telling people at school may be the weirdest though 
2014-03-31 14:06:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You think?
2014-03-31 14:06:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like most of them would be on board. Or at least most of the people I was close with.
2014-03-31 14:10:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, maybe not. I've given Haley all the deets and she is totally behind it. I dunno, I guess just thinking about the older students who mostly knew you when you were with Hannah and are probably friends with her...and then there's me the supposed "party girl" of the program and this whirlwind romance that to them is based off of us grinding on each other for a night in Austin and hooking up on your spring break....
2014-03-31 14:12:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm probably totally being ridiculous and basing most of my feelings like this on what Brett texted me (which is not representative of the whole program), but I feel like most people will secretly think I'm not good enough for you and just a rebound/ridiculous fling
2014-03-31 14:12:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I accidentally threw in some of my own very slight apprehensions in there haha
2014-03-31 14:14:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well... I think my closest friends (Jon, Tim, Tom, Haley, etc.) want me to be happy and trust my judgment. I don't think people I wasn't close with would really care.
2014-03-31 14:16:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the only people to worry about would be Brett and anyone who thinks he was unfairly wronged.
2014-03-31 14:17:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They wouldn't care on your behalf, but some of the people who I'm closer friends with will definitely roll their eyes at first
2014-03-31 14:18:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But like you said, not a lot of people knew about y'all, and I doubt any rational thinking person could really fault either of us if they have all the details.
2014-03-31 14:18:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why do think they'll roll their eyes?
2014-03-31 14:19:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno
2014-03-31 14:20:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So there's something I haven't mentioned yet, and it's mostly bc it hasn't really come up. And bc it's a bit complicated of a story 
2014-03-31 14:21:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha oh boy
2014-03-31 14:21:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dat accelerated heart rate
2014-03-31 14:24:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But the guy I was kind of dating over the summer (who has been a good friend of mine for 6 yrs before that) came to visit me over Valentines weekend (which was also just an obnoxious coincidence). But we had an 'agreement' of sorts that if one of us was seeing someone at that time he would sleep on the couch. But since Neither of us were he slept with me. 
2014-03-31 14:25:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But he met the 2nd years and went out dancing with them and I explained the situation to a few of them, so I feel like my cred of not being a floozy (for lack of a better word) might be low in that group
2014-03-31 14:27:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I told him about you though, actually mentioned you in passing after Austin lol. He's pretty happy for me, though also slightly skeptical
2014-03-31 14:29:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I have a tendency to feel guilty/think people judge me for my sexual relationships, though that's derived from guilt carried over from my mother and high school gossip, so more than likely no one cares
2014-03-31 14:30:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I don't know why anyone in the Darwinian cluster would care.
2014-03-31 14:30:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry for the accelerated heart rate, that's not a huge deal is it?
2014-03-31 14:30:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This all sounds pretty tame to me.
2014-03-31 14:30:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd already sort of deduced that shit
2014-03-31 14:31:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Social media stalking? Haha
2014-03-31 14:32:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I guess. It's the dude who sent you flowers and is in some pics with you on Instagram right?
2014-03-31 14:34:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, his name is Reuel. The flowers were mostly a joke, like "Since I never got you flowers when we were together" thing.
2014-03-31 14:35:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol, don't really care honestly. Just saying it was kinda obvious and didn't require much stalking on my part.
2014-03-31 14:37:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, cool. I just feel like we've talked so much about some things, but haven't covered some other basic history and I don't want you to feel like I'm hiding stuff from you.
2014-03-31 14:40:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Honestly, you can divulge as little or as much of your history as you feel comfortable. I'm happy with the current Katie. If you want to open up about previous relationships for any reason I'm all ears, and if you don't that's cool too.
2014-03-31 15:00:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, now might be a good time to fess up another thing that I probably should've mentioned by now, but hadn't mostly for selfish reasons (like I thought it would keep you from wanting to see me again in Dallas if I told you before). But Brett and I actually very drunkenly kinda hooked up Monday night in Austin. Which I regretted immediately the next day, especially since he pretty forcibly initiated it in front of Adam Hardy (which was embarrassing) and then he completely ignored me and avoided me on Tuesday. And then heard he had been trying to get with Haley the whole trip/winter break but she wasn't reciprocating. We never talked about it after until walking back from Jimmy's that night you were in town. And that's when I thought we could be actual friends and he joked about me hooking up with you while you were in Chicago.
2014-03-31 15:05:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So that's why I feel like he will only be mad at me for our relationship, and not you, even though he made it sound like he would be ok with it/was expecting it. And because he had the opportunity to tell you that Tuesday night and he decided not to
2014-03-31 15:06:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I wanted to talk to him first and figure out if that's the reason why he's being so weird about everything before telling you.
2014-03-31 15:08:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it still doesn't change the fact I guess 
2014-03-31 15:11:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I DID NOT dance with you to make him jealous or anything like that, because based on the way he was acting I still didn't think he would care or even notice. 
2014-03-31 15:12:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha you sure about that?
2014-03-31 15:13:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess the only way it might've affected my choice of actions on Tuesday was by providing a stark contrast between how I felt interacting with you vs him. He never said anything close to that statement of "I just want to let you know so you can feel good about yourself, but I'm super into you". 
2014-03-31 15:15:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It reminded me how nice it was to be shown some affection, particularly by someone I was also into
2014-03-31 15:19:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should've just told you in Dallas, I hate not being able to see your face or talk to you about this
2014-03-31 15:27:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can I call you?
2014-03-31 15:35:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm in class. I'll be done in a few.
2014-03-31 15:36:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh ok. Well now I feel especially shitty about my timing  
2014-03-31 15:50:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK well I don't really know what to say. I wasn't trying to freak you out just now. It is what it is I guess.
2014-03-31 15:53:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I haven't slept at all in over 30 hours, so I'm not in the most stable of my emotional states.
2014-03-31 15:55:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I understand. Well I hope talking about all of this is making you feel better about things.
2014-03-31 15:55:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm about to board the plane in like 15 minutes, but can you at least give me an idea about what's going through your head? Or maybe we can talk about it later tonight if you want some time to think?
2014-03-31 15:57:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm obviously glad that I told you, but now I'm worried I did it in the worst way possible and that it ruined everything
2014-03-31 15:58:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's a pretty messy situation. I guess we've gotta clean it up the best we can and move on. I'm going to operate under the assumption that this kind of thing isn't gonna happen on the regular.
2014-03-31 16:01:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What kind of thing? The me hooking up with Brett thing? Or having semi-dramatic and draining revelations about my sordid past?
2014-03-31 16:02:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because the former will certainly never happen again, and I'm pretty sure that's the only thing in my past that would be upsetting to you
2014-03-31 16:03:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hooking up and putting us in tense situations.
2014-03-31 16:03:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not necessarily with Brett.
2014-03-31 16:04:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean. It's whatever. Like I said earlier today, you live your life and if I can keep up, great.
2014-03-31 16:06:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm really into you and you're an amazing person. The same aspects of you that I might not be able to handle are the ones that I'm really attracted too.
2014-03-31 16:07:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]To.
2014-03-31 16:07:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I should say some of the aspects.
2014-03-31 16:08:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm really attracted to other things about you that I don't think could hurt me haha
2014-03-31 16:08:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, I don't think it's fair or accurate to assume that the shit I did when I was single and had no one I really cared about in my life is going to happen when I'm with someone I  do  care about
2014-03-31 16:08:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like I don't think you studying oysters will ever break my heart :)
2014-03-31 16:10:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I appreciate the effort to make this lighter, but it's probably not gonna help right this minute
2014-03-31 16:10:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok
2014-03-31 16:10:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I don't think I'm assuming anything about you.
2014-03-31 16:11:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We just talked today about how you feel about "cheating"
2014-03-31 16:11:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I told you straight up I'm not gonna stop you from hooking up.
2014-03-31 16:12:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I told you I wouldn't ever want to hurt you
2014-03-31 16:12:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That doesn't mean I think you're going to do that, or that it'll ruin our relationship if it does happen.
2014-03-31 16:13:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I talked about how  I  would feel if someone I was dating hooked up with someone 
2014-03-31 16:14:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. I don't know. I'm really into you. Like REALLY into you. And I'm completely invested.
2014-03-31 16:15:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry if I'm making you feel... I don't know. How am I making you feel?
2014-03-31 16:15:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You type too fast lol
2014-03-31 16:15:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish you had just called
2014-03-31 16:15:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nothing you've told me today has changed how I see you.
2014-03-31 16:16:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't believe that 
2014-03-31 16:16:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#OnTheBus
2014-03-31 16:16:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I'm sorry you don't believe me. I'd kiss you really hard and convince you otherwise if I was with you.
2014-03-31 16:18:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just exhausted, and am almost certainly not thinking straight. 
2014-03-31 16:20:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my fingers are having issues typing on this tiny phone lol
2014-03-31 16:21:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK well just don't worry about us. Just keep doing what you're doing, because you make me ridiculously happy.
2014-03-31 16:22:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And let me know if there are things I could be doing better, cuz you be happy is really important to me.
2014-03-31 16:22:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And really, the idea of sleeping with anyone else but you is just silly. If only because you're easily the best lay I've ever had
2014-03-31 16:23:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha now you're just buttering me up.
2014-03-31 16:24:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Factor in my fast growing feelings for you, and I guess that's why it upsets me if you think that's something I would want to do
2014-03-31 16:26:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm in a different situation than I'm used to, where I've slept with more ppl than you and you've had these long, really really serious relationships 
2014-03-31 16:27:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's different about the situation?
2014-03-31 16:27:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just the fact I've been in serious relationships?
2014-03-31 16:29:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean usually I've slept with fewer/about the same amount of ppl. And I guess I'm just a little intimidated by you being with someone for 4 years when my longest was 1 yr.
2014-03-31 16:29:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not really sure why that intimidates me, 
2014-03-31 16:29:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't understand what's intimidating
2014-03-31 16:29:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-03-31 16:30:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]something to do with committal?
2014-03-31 16:30:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-03-31 16:32:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe commitment. And That it sounds like you've never 'casually' hooked up with someone, and so the fact that I have gives you inherent cause to say that if this doesn't work out it's probably bc of me
2014-03-31 16:32:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]uhhh absolutley not
2014-03-31 16:32:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can basically guarantee you it'd be my fault
2014-03-31 16:32:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-31 16:32:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well hopefully not this time
2014-03-31 16:32:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but historically it's always been my fault
2014-03-31 16:32:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well that's not what this comment indicates
2014-03-31 16:33:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean. It's whatever. Like I said earlier today, you live your life and if I can keep up, great.
2014-03-31 16:33:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's because that's what I'm striving for this go around
2014-03-31 16:33:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't want this to end because I'm an asshole
2014-03-31 16:33:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know you think I'm great and all
2014-03-31 16:33:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I can and have been a real asshole at times
2014-03-31 16:34:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm pretty sure it's why each of my past relationships have ended
2014-03-31 16:36:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm, reading back over what you've said with that intent in mind, I feel like I was interpreting everything you were saying at the wrong angle. Or just twisting it to match my own slight insecurities about fucking this up.
2014-03-31 16:37:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So maybe we should both worry a little less about messing this up, at least today :)
2014-03-31 16:37:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sounds good.
2014-03-31 16:38:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do you feel?
2014-03-31 16:38:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My flight is delayed :///
2014-03-31 16:38:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn, how long?
2014-03-31 16:39:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel physically ill, but a bit better emotionally about our talk 
2014-03-31 16:39:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And an indeterminate amount of time
2014-03-31 16:39:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man    😞 
2014-03-31 16:40:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that doesn't sound like a great place to be
2014-03-31 16:40:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should've napped during my layover, but nooooo I just had to tell you every thought Ive had in the past 24+ hours
2014-03-31 16:40:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-31 16:41:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good
2014-03-31 16:41:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's for the best
2014-03-31 16:41:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish I was seeing you right now though
2014-03-31 16:41:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too
2014-03-31 16:41:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really bad
2014-03-31 16:41:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we can save some of the heavy talks for in person
2014-03-31 16:42:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess
2014-03-31 16:42:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least not so many through text 
2014-03-31 16:42:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-03-31 16:42:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I just wanna enjoy your presence on the rare occasions I'm with you, though
2014-03-31 16:43:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it would be a lot easier talking about this stuff in person, though
2014-03-31 16:43:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there'd be a lot less anxiety
2014-03-31 16:44:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's why I didn't mention the Brett thing, and now I totally wish I had in person lol
2014-03-31 16:44:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's amazing how much physical contact can comfort you know?
2014-03-31 16:44:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like just a touch can communicate so much
2014-03-31 16:45:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, but for me it's just easier to know what a person means/is feeling if I can see their face
2014-03-31 16:45:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I dig
2014-03-31 16:45:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess for me the physical contact is a strong indicator of the tension
2014-03-31 16:46:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I guess is similar to the face thing
2014-03-31 16:47:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have too much of a morbid imagination for serious texting conversations. Like I can have a tendency to assume the worst
2014-03-31 16:47:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially when I'm running on no food or sleep
2014-03-31 16:48:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-03-31 16:48:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that doesn't really make these kinds of convos any easier
2014-03-31 16:48:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you initiated it!
2014-03-31 16:48:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-31 16:49:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, I know. I was just enjoying/stimulated by our numbered conversation I didn't want to stop
2014-03-31 16:49:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're like my own personal drug
2014-03-31 16:50:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]An addictive truth serum haha
2014-03-31 16:50:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I can dig that
2014-03-31 16:50:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe consider the dose next time, though?
2014-03-31 16:50:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-31 16:50:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't like it when you're bummed out
2014-03-31 16:52:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, maybe don't get so caught up that I enter into a convo like that unprepared 
2014-03-31 16:53:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-03-31 16:53:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And while you're in class 
2014-03-31 16:53:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I really do appreciate your honesty and openness

2014-03-31 16:56:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha these nothing to get, I'm just slowly cracking over here in Detroit
2014-03-31 16:57:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, damn you're in Detroit?
2014-03-31 16:57:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so close
2014-03-31 16:57:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*there's 
2014-03-31 16:57:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]if I had rented a car I'd almost be there by now
2014-03-31 16:57:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's shitty
2014-03-31 16:58:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And they had earlier flights during my layover, but I would've had to pay $75 to get on them
2014-03-31 16:58:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuckin AA
2014-03-31 16:58:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-03-31 16:58:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I honestly hate flying
2014-03-31 16:58:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's such a colossal pain in the ass
2014-03-31 16:59:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kinda like it, or at least don't hate it. But I hate waiting in airports, which is why I have sprinted to more gates than not lol
2014-03-31 17:00:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like to live life on the edge sometimes  😎
2014-03-31 17:00:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😽😻😸😺
2014-03-31 17:00:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-31 17:00:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I forgot about these doodads
2014-03-31 17:01:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What are you doing this evening?
2014-03-31 17:01:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably just gonna work on homework
2014-03-31 17:03:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Word.
2014-03-31 17:04:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I don't think I can quite pull off "Word." 
2014-03-31 17:04:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-03-31 17:04:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I noticed that you used it
2014-03-31 17:04:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even know how or when I started saying i
2014-03-31 17:04:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]t
2014-03-31 17:04:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty sure I picked up "rad" relatively recently
2014-03-31 17:05:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not really sure from who or why
2014-03-31 17:05:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I pick up other peoples language pretty quickly and subconsciously
2014-03-31 17:05:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah, I guess that's language!
2014-03-31 17:07:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True, but it's usually silly slang words that don't make me sound any more intelligent or mature. Like dope, pretty sure I got that from the bro
2014-03-31 17:07:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-31 17:07:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-03-31 17:07:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know anyone except you who uses that
2014-03-31 17:08:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ehh, I know a few people, most stoners lol
2014-03-31 17:11:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my baby brother turned 19 today
2014-03-31 17:14:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's exciting! Did you get him a present?
2014-03-31 17:14:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nah
2014-03-31 17:14:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the siblings don't really get each other presents for birthdays anymore
2014-03-31 17:14:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll probably start back up when I have an income someday
2014-03-31 17:16:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, Daniel and I only get each other something if we find something totally perfect 
2014-03-31 17:17:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then that's usually not around a holiday, so it's just a random gift lol
2014-03-31 17:17:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well that's pretty fun
2014-03-31 17:17:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the kind of thing I like to think I'd do
2014-03-31 17:17:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's gonna be interesting when I actually have money in my life
2014-03-31 17:18:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm curious what I'll end up doing with it
2014-03-31 17:18:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad I know you're not into me for my fat stacks of cash
2014-03-31 17:19:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should probably be questioning your judgment getting with a dude who is borderline in poverty
2014-03-31 17:19:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-31 17:20:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I see potential in you. Computer Science does pay pretty well...
2014-03-31 17:20:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaaa
2014-03-31 17:21:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But really, I've never cared much about being taken on fancy dates or given expensive things
2014-03-31 17:22:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, that's the vibe I get.
2014-03-31 17:23:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would probably be a little confused if someone  I was dating bought me like an iPad for my birthday. Unless I had been talking about getting an iPad forever or realllyyyyy wanted one 
2014-03-31 17:23:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You somehow have this balance of appreciating the finer things in life without being all uppity
2014-03-31 17:23:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-31 17:23:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get that
2014-03-31 17:24:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but some nice experiences are a little on the expensive side
2014-03-31 17:24:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd be nice to be able to do that kind of thing on the regular
2014-03-31 17:24:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I appreciate the finer things, but I like being able to pay for them mysejfv
2014-03-31 17:24:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]without worrying about whether or not I can afford rent
2014-03-31 17:24:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-31 17:26:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth, I'm not saying I wanttt to make 30k the rest of my life. 
2014-03-31 17:26:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I dig
2014-03-31 17:26:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]being like hyper broke has been pretty humbling
2014-03-31 17:27:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've always been pretty progressive as far as the lower class goes, but I feel like I've experience some of the shit they have to deal with first hand now
2014-03-31 17:27:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like no health insurance
2014-03-31 17:27:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and being turned down for a job because I didn't have acar
2014-03-31 17:27:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's shitty man
2014-03-31 17:27:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm not even legitimately poor
2014-03-31 17:28:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because if shit hit the fan I could move in with my parents
2014-03-31 17:28:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a lot of people don't have that safety net
2014-03-31 17:29:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth, but I guess its the best way to be poor? Haha 
2014-03-31 17:29:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Get the experience
2014-03-31 17:31:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And compute science jokes aside, you are pretty set for the future. You just have to go through a year or two of eating velveeta products 
2014-03-31 17:31:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I'm hoping
2014-03-31 17:34:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And while I'm not attracted to you for the $$$, I do really like that you have a plan and a passion you're following :)
2014-03-31 17:35:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's easily one of the things that I first noticed/was attracted to in you 
2014-03-31 17:35:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah?
2014-03-31 17:36:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When did you even become aware of what I was doing?
2014-03-31 17:37:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you talked about your major in Austin. Walking from the taco place I think.
2014-03-31 17:38:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even remember that. But that's cool you noticed.
2014-03-31 17:39:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You just seemed confident that you were doing the 'right' thing
2014-03-31 17:40:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word, well I definitely feel that way, so that sounds right.
2014-03-31 17:40:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dig confidence lol
2014-03-31 17:41:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's interesting that you remember that.
2014-03-31 17:41:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I definitely don't lack confidence.
2014-03-31 17:41:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty irrational at times
2014-03-31 17:41:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-31 17:42:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd say it's more cocky at times
2014-03-31 17:42:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-03-31 17:43:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Using "at times" then "haha" back-to-back is not cool
2014-03-31 17:44:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh it's pretty cool. Makes me feel better about my excessive use of definitely 
2014-03-31 17:44:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, that was pretty great
2014-03-31 17:45:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I find that the more tired I am, the more the lols come out.
2014-03-31 17:45:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah? I wonder why that is.
2014-03-31 17:45:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My least favorite slang word ever 
2014-03-31 17:46:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol?
2014-03-31 17:46:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, my mentality and typing abilities have regressed to that of a 13 year old girl 
2014-03-31 17:46:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-31 17:46:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I avoided using it until recently, like the past year
2014-03-31 17:46:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude, me too!
2014-03-31 17:46:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe not the last year
2014-03-31 17:46:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but last couple
2014-03-31 17:47:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Instead I had a system of "haha"a
2014-03-31 17:47:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A
2014-03-31 17:47:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*'s
2014-03-31 17:47:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I used to (lightly) make fun of people for it
2014-03-31 17:47:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure why I switched
2014-03-31 17:47:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I viciously made fun of ppl for it
2014-03-31 17:48:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's honestly really fucking goofy
2014-03-31 17:48:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it sounds super weird pronounced
2014-03-31 17:48:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But after a point, too many haha's looks silly too I guess
2014-03-31 17:49:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah for sure
2014-03-31 17:49:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe the variety is what brought me to it
2014-03-31 17:50:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I started using it ironically, like things I didn't actually think were funny, and it evolved 
2014-03-31 17:50:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually can't even remember when I started using it
2014-03-31 17:50:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it might've been years ago
2014-03-31 17:50:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have no idea
2014-03-31 17:50:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm finally on the plane!
2014-03-31 17:51:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet!
2014-03-31 17:51:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]An hour and a half delayed. I could've taken a 4.5 hour nap -_-
2014-03-31 17:52:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yowza
2014-03-31 17:52:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well you're almost home now
2014-03-31 17:52:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you sleep in tomorrow?
2014-03-31 17:52:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah, I'm flying in to ohare 
2014-03-31 17:52:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And no one would come pick me up cause it was the middle if rush hour :(
2014-03-31 17:53:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]shitttt
2014-03-31 17:53:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fuck getting to Hyde Park from O'Hare on CTA
2014-03-31 17:53:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it takes forever
2014-03-31 17:54:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth, but according to Peter it would've been a  4 hr drive round trip to get me at 6pm
2014-03-31 17:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bull fucking shit
2014-03-31 17:54:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-31 17:54:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which sounds ridiculous, but I guess I've never done that drive before 
2014-03-31 17:54:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he's full of shit
2014-03-31 17:55:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And now I can't decide if I should ask bout getting me at 7:30 or not
2014-03-31 17:55:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause when does rush hour end?
2014-03-31 17:55:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'll be well past the peak by then
2014-03-31 17:59:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna ask, I also can't find my Ventra card. I was such a mess packing this morning I have no idea where it is
2014-03-31 18:00:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn
2014-03-31 18:01:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm legitimately worried about passing out on the blue line bad waking up back at O'Hare lol
2014-03-31 18:01:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha man that'd be shitty
2014-03-31 18:01:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]See, a comment that I dont actually find funny at all, but feel like it needs a lol designator 
2014-03-31 18:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I use it the same way
2014-03-31 18:02:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I also legitimately laugh at that kind of shit
2014-03-31 18:03:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not at the expense of others
2014-03-31 18:03:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when it's happening to me
2014-03-31 18:03:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I'm just too brain dead to find anything funny right now I feel like. 
2014-03-31 18:04:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah... I'd definitely be scrambled if I was you
2014-03-31 18:04:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've had quite the 36 (?) hours
2014-03-31 18:04:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, I don't think I have interest this flight, which is good cause maybe I'll sleep. But means we'll have to pause this 12 hour long conversation lol
2014-03-31 18:05:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha ok
2014-03-31 18:05:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have a nice flight
2014-03-31 18:05:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just to reiterate
2014-03-31 18:05:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm totally into you
2014-03-31 18:05:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you are completely amazing
2014-03-31 18:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I miss you
2014-03-31 18:05:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]relax and get some rest    😃 
2014-03-31 18:11:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thank you so much for that :)
2014-03-31 19:11:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bumpiest flight ever and still didn't sleep
2014-03-31 19:12:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Shiiiit
2014-03-31 19:12:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you getting a ride?
2014-03-31 19:12:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also check this out
2014-03-31 19:12:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, Dave's gonna pick me up
2014-03-31 19:13:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Heck yeah!
2014-03-31 19:19:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am so desperate for my bed, I feel like I'm running in some emergency backup manic energy stores now 
2014-03-31 19:20:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, man I can only imagine
2014-03-31 19:20:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've been drained in all kinds of ways
2014-03-31 19:21:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And in answer to your question, I have Speciation and Ethics tm, but they're afternoon/evening so I can sleep in a little 
2014-03-31 19:22:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good
2014-03-31 19:22:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]get a fresh start
2014-03-31 19:24:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I probs won't be 'fresh' until Thursday at the earliest. 
2014-03-31 19:24:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha good point
2014-03-31 19:24:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more fresh?
2014-03-31 19:24:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]less rotten?
2014-03-31 19:27:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh, speaking if which I totally forgot to take my trash out before I left  🙊👃💩
2014-03-31 19:27:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-03-31 19:27:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yeah that's gonna suck
2014-03-31 19:31:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha man you just came out of nowhere with that relationship history stuff
2014-03-31 19:31:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you have any idea what prompted you?
2014-03-31 19:32:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]MDMA?
2014-03-31 19:33:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it was related to the convo we were having about how Darwinian people would react
2014-03-31 19:33:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it was just so heavy for that moment!
2014-03-31 19:33:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gosh I'm in the middle of typing that sentence and then you go answer your own question!
2014-03-31 19:36:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Well, now might be a good time to fess up another thing..." lol no
2014-03-31 19:36:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm for real laughing at that lead in
2014-03-31 19:36:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think it had anything to do with the drugs, except for exhaustion making me more vulnerable(?) or emotionally unstable rather. And I think talking about how other's would perceive the likelihood of persistence of this relationship got me starting down the dark, unnecessary path of questioning it myself 
2014-03-31 19:38:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you feel better about it now?
2014-03-31 19:39:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So yeah, and then I imagined bringing up the Brett thing at a later date and you being surprised/upset I didn't bring it up when we were directly talking about recent hookups of possible importance 
2014-03-31 19:40:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I guess I was thinking about it and felt super guilty all of a sudden for not being upfront about it earlier
2014-03-31 19:42:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like you've seen (or at least text interacted with) me at a rare extreme of my personality, and I guess if that didn't freak you out then that's pretty cool 
2014-03-31 19:43:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah not freaked out
2014-03-31 19:43:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mostly just feel bad
2014-03-31 19:43:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it seemed like you were getting a bit defensive for a minute
2014-03-31 19:44:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I really wasn't trying to be judgemental
2014-03-31 19:44:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was trying to take the opposite approach
2014-03-31 19:44:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess there might've just been some misunderstanding going on
2014-03-31 19:44:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you were in a high stress state
2014-03-31 19:45:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do wish you'd call and talk to me if something ever happens again (not that I anticipate it ever will)
2014-03-31 19:45:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*something similar to this
2014-03-31 19:45:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Deal
2014-03-31 19:47:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I had subconsciously convinced myself you would be judgmental, especially in light of some of what we talked about earlier today
2014-03-31 19:47:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But if you're not, then we're cool
2014-03-31 19:48:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Better than cool, we're excellent 
2014-03-31 19:48:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha and what's the alternative?
2014-03-31 19:49:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you mean? 
2014-03-31 19:49:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like if I was being judgmental
2014-03-31 19:49:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know haha
2014-03-31 19:50:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, well I'm not judging
2014-03-31 19:50:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you just had me curious
2014-03-31 19:50:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm kinda hoping you aren't and we can end this conversation for at least the next 24 hours
2014-03-31 19:50:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can rehash it later when I'm more myself if you want 
2014-03-31 19:51:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm good
2014-03-31 19:51:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless you want to talk about it again of course
2014-03-31 19:54:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K, well at least right now I feel like we got a little worked up over some hypothetical concerns that we don't need to be worrying about, at least not to that deep of an extent 
2014-03-31 19:55:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]honestly, I'm not really worked up about anything
2014-03-31 19:55:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you're pretty into me    😉 
2014-03-31 19:55:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and until you do something to suggest otherwise I'm gonna roll with that mindset
2014-03-31 19:56:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I agree we might have been spending more time dwelling on possible negative hypotheticals than we needed to
2014-03-31 19:56:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]especially since the probability of them happening seems negligible at the moment
2014-03-31 19:57:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right, I'm not quite ready to blow past the "happy, mushy, getting to know each other" phase haha
2014-03-31 19:57:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]defintitely
2014-03-31 19:58:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm hoping the happy, mushy stuff isn't a phase, though!
2014-03-31 20:58:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Agreed. Home now after Dave helped pick up Florence 
2014-03-31 20:59:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awesome
2014-03-31 20:59:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you take out the trash?
2014-03-31 21:01:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just did. Didn't smell nearly as bad as I thought it would, unless my nose has quit functioning properly too  
2014-03-31 21:02:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I suppose that's a real possibility at this point
2014-03-31 21:06:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Could we possibly video for just a few minutes before I crash? If I can't snuggle with you after this long, slightly ridiculous day I'd like to at least see your face :)
2014-03-31 21:06:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for sure
2014-03-31 21:08:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K gimme a minute to get my shit together 
2014-03-31 21:20:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is now an ok time? 
2014-03-31 21:21:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yep!
2014-03-31 21:38:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=558469161231&set=a.868904631061.2513383.7031174&type=3&theater
2014-04-01 12:02:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Brain is now 70% operational, which is a big improvement from yesterday
2014-04-01 12:03:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha good to hear
2014-04-01 12:04:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still haven't made it out of bed though 
2014-04-01 12:05:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol when's your first class?
2014-04-01 12:05:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]3
2014-04-01 12:05:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, no rush
2014-04-01 12:06:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't realize we video'd for like an hour and a half last night
2014-04-01 12:07:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah! I was surprised by how long you lasted
2014-04-01 12:07:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really enjoyed it, though
2014-04-01 12:09:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did too, it was comforting having your face be the last thing I see before closing my eyes
2014-04-01 12:09:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awwwww
2014-04-01 12:09:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was pretty sappy lol 
2014-04-01 12:09:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe
2014-04-01 12:09:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even for me
2014-04-01 12:09:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I loved it, though!
2014-04-01 12:10:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I must've been a little more anxious than I realized yesterday because I had a couple of pretty unpleasant dreams
2014-04-01 12:12:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh, what about?
2014-04-01 12:12:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in one I was getting into it with Brett and in the other I was getting into it with Hannah
2014-04-01 12:12:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]woke up a little stressed out
2014-04-01 12:13:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those do sound unpleasant
2014-04-01 12:15:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry that the stuff we talked about yesterday stressed you out
2014-04-01 12:17:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's okay! It was a good talk. if that's any kind of indication of how we will totally handle uncomfortable situations, then I feel really good about things.
2014-04-01 12:22:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not really sure where the totally came from
2014-04-01 12:24:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I thought about that yesterday on the ride home with Dave. How even though I was a wreck and barely able to handle losing my Ventra card (I almost cried about it lol), we somehow ended up totally ok
2014-04-01 12:28:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And since I don't intend on ever going without food or sleep for 34 hours again, dealing with anything should be easy peezy going forward
2014-04-01 12:28:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha awesome
2014-04-01 12:29:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't get the GRFP
2014-04-01 12:29:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which is understandable, bc my project was kinda crap
2014-04-01 12:29:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry to hear that, but it really ain't no thang.
2014-04-01 12:30:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm still not entirely sure how they pick that shit.
2014-04-01 12:30:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The year before my cohort had like a 100% success rate
2014-04-01 12:30:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or something ridiculous like that
2014-04-01 12:31:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and our year only had a couple
2014-04-01 12:31:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like there's an element of luck to it honestly
2014-04-01 12:32:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, who you get to review your app makes a huge difference 
2014-04-01 12:32:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Last year like 6 got it
2014-04-01 12:33:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well, just keep on truckin'.
2014-04-01 12:33:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I remember a study that came out within the past couple of years that showed the GRFP isn't a good indicator of a scientist's future contribution
2014-04-01 12:33:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which isn't really surprising
2014-04-01 12:34:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's nice to have some concrete support for that fact
2014-04-01 12:37:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not bummed about it. Next year I'll almost certainly have a better idea of my project
2014-04-01 12:39:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good. I felt pretty insecure about my abilities as a scientist when I was rejected, so I'm just saying stuff that helped me :)
2014-04-01 12:46:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha, I appreciate it. When I wrote it in the Fall, I went through that phase where I felt like I knew nothing and would fail as a scientist. But I've shaken it since then
2014-04-01 12:47:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good to hear.
2014-04-01 14:19:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did this skull thumping trick and almost no more ringing! I'm not entirely sure how or why it works though...  http://m.wikihow.com/Stop-Ringing-in-Ears
2014-04-01 14:43:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha what in the world? That's so weird.
2014-04-01 14:44:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]buttt, I'm going to go off the grid for a bit
2014-04-01 14:47:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You being so great makes it a  little  too easy for me to not do work  
2014-04-01 14:49:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so let's just say I'll be good to chat again around 9
2014-04-01 14:49:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha that's totally ok.
2014-04-01 14:49:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have a good first day of class!
2014-04-01 14:50:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks! 
2014-04-01 20:10:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you're back on the grid and free you should call meeee because I have exciting opportunities to discuss!
2014-04-01 21:51:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]UTD is offering one section of Artificial Intelligence next fall and it's on a fucking Saturday!
2014-04-01 21:55:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How long is it?
2014-04-01 21:56:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2:45
2014-04-01 21:56:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I'm gonna take it
2014-04-01 21:56:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll take it in the spring if it's offered
2014-04-01 21:56:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's fucking football season man
2014-04-01 21:56:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who does that?
2014-04-01 21:56:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a school without a football team
2014-04-01 21:56:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's who
2014-04-01 21:56:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha what time is it on Saturday?
2014-04-01 21:56:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2-4:45
2014-04-01 21:57:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aw come on 
2014-04-01 21:57:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like you mighttt regret not taking it if it's not offered in Spring 
2014-04-01 21:57:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's offered every semester
2014-04-01 21:57:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they had two sections this semester
2014-04-01 21:58:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's a Bioinformatics course in the fall, but it's at the same time as the Big Data course that is a core for the Data Science track
2014-04-01 21:58:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's kind of a drag
2014-04-01 21:59:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Big Data is kind of a goofy name 
2014-04-01 21:59:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah it's pure buzzword
2014-04-01 22:00:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's your opinion on the term "millennials" ?
2014-04-01 22:00:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Indifferent I guess
2014-04-01 22:00:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do you feel about it
2014-04-01 22:01:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I waver I guess, but I like it better than any other name I've heard for our generation. Some of my friends hate it though
2014-04-01 22:02:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are the other names?
2014-04-01 22:02:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and why do they hate it?
2014-04-01 22:02:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just a word
2014-04-01 22:03:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Generation Y
2014-04-01 22:04:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I've heard Generation 9/11 I some contexts
2014-04-01 22:04:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-04-01 22:04:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]generation 9/11 is pretty interesting
2014-04-01 22:04:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and descriptive I feel like
2014-04-01 22:05:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One of my close friends from home was a marketing major and has some strong opinions on language. She also dislikes buzzword, I guess she just thinks they sound stupid lol
2014-04-01 22:06:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not crazy about buzzwords because they are almost always marketing bullshit
2014-04-01 22:06:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-01 22:08:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think she might be a slightly self-deprecating business major. She's super talented dancer/singer, but figured she wouldn't ever make a living that way...
2014-04-01 22:08:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think the 9/11 is pretty descriptive for some aspects of our generation
2014-04-01 22:08:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And what has been different in our world compared to the previous
2014-04-01 22:10:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I don't think 9/11 has defined our lives (ppl born from like 80-95 let's say) as much as maybe Gen X
2014-04-01 22:11:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it has a bigger impact on Gen Y
2014-04-01 22:11:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Gen Y was the people who were being shipped off and signing up for the military after 9/11
2014-04-01 22:12:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it got Bush another four years
2014-04-01 22:12:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which shaped a lot of our generations political views
2014-04-01 22:12:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and probably got Obama elected
2014-04-01 22:13:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the economic shittiness is kind of big for our generation
2014-04-01 22:13:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't know how much of that has to do with Bush
2014-04-01 22:14:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as much as shit Reagan had set in motion in the 80s
2014-04-01 22:17:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess when I think about characteristics of generations, I think more about their general traits and values than the environment they're in, even though that obviously can affect the former
2014-04-01 22:18:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really? I'm the opposite
2014-04-01 22:18:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's kinda hard to really generalize values and traits for a generation isn't it?
2014-04-01 22:20:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I've read a number of articles about how we are (in general), more ambitious/narcissistic/dependent on our parents longer than X
2014-04-01 22:20:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously no everyone is that way
2014-04-01 22:21:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-04-01 22:21:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]see
2014-04-01 22:21:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except for the ambitious thing
2014-04-01 22:21:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see that stuff as simply environmental things
2014-04-01 22:21:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"narcissistic" = we use social media and old people think it's narcissistic
2014-04-01 22:21:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The last one certainly is in response to the economy
2014-04-01 22:22:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"dependent on parents" = aka, we're broke because the economy is shitty and a college degree doesn't get you a good job anymore
2014-04-01 22:23:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They've done personality tests and shown that we as a whole actually are more narcissistic than our parents
2014-04-01 22:23:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which isnt necessarily a bad thing
2014-04-01 22:23:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean that's fine
2014-04-01 22:23:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's almost certainly a result of social media
2014-04-01 22:24:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not saying it isn't
2014-04-01 22:24:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'm not sure what we're arguing about. 
2014-04-01 22:25:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]generation 9/11
2014-04-01 22:25:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think 9/11 defines gen X more
2014-04-01 22:25:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because you think traits are what defines a generation
2014-04-01 22:25:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think events and environment define a generation
2014-04-01 22:25:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I think 9/11 defines gen Y more
2014-04-01 22:26:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if you said what traits 9/11 defines about Gen X, though
2014-04-01 22:27:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok give me a minute
2014-04-01 22:27:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You speed-typing demon
2014-04-01 22:27:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-01 22:32:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright, I retract my statement that it defines X more. I guess a part of me does not  want  it to define our generation (ie be our name), as it stemmed from hate and has resulted in hate. But I agree that the consequences of it certainly shaped many peoples political views
2014-04-01 22:35:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As for what either of us think about when we think about generation generalizations, thats just us saying the same thing looking at it from different angles, or getting tangled in the semantics of the word "defines" Like I said before, obviously the environment affects traits. 
2014-04-01 22:36:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok you can type again
2014-04-01 22:36:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-04-01 22:37:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Otm4RusESNU
2014-04-01 22:38:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahahaha perfect
2014-04-01 22:43:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I appreciate that you challenge what I say
2014-04-01 22:43:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad!
2014-04-01 22:43:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I appreciate that you challenge what I say too
2014-04-01 22:44:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that you're capable
2014-04-01 22:44:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're the first girl I've been with who isn't intimidated by me in debate
2014-04-01 22:44:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*woman
2014-04-01 22:44:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-04-01 22:45:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and who doesn't get defensive
2014-04-01 22:45:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhh I can sometimes get defensive haha
2014-04-01 22:45:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well, I guess we'll see
2014-04-01 22:46:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But usually I'm pretty good about realizing when I'm wrong, or didn't actually mean what i said
2014-04-01 22:46:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Things pop out sometimes and I'm just like "No, actually i completely disagree with what i just said" 
2014-04-01 22:46:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah... the defensiveness I'm thinking of stems more from them being overwhelmed
2014-04-01 22:47:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-01 22:47:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have noticed you might be contrarian at times
2014-04-01 22:48:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm a significantly better writer than i'll ever be at debating
2014-04-01 22:48:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Verbally
2014-04-01 22:48:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think things are particularly organized well in my head
2014-04-01 22:48:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-04-01 22:49:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And also I think I'm at a point of my life with significantly shifting views and opinions
2014-04-01 22:49:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And i havent quite worked all those out and reconciled them
2014-04-01 22:49:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really?
2014-04-01 22:49:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty interesting
2014-04-01 22:50:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think my views have really shifted much
2014-04-01 22:50:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]since like high school really
2014-04-01 22:50:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]things have sort of solidified
2014-04-01 22:50:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and become clearer
2014-04-01 22:50:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think my views are pretty much the same
2014-04-01 22:54:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess theres just been such an influx of experiences and knowledge in the past year for me
2014-04-01 22:56:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my parents never really shared their political or ideological views, nor did anyone else really in grade school. So I dont think I discussed it much and therefore didn't really start questioning myself about it until like sophomore year of college  
2014-04-01 22:56:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I guess I got sort of big in that when I was in high school
2014-04-01 22:57:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my world was sort of shattered in a way when I realized I didn't believe in God
2014-04-01 22:57:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or a personal Christian God
2014-04-01 22:58:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and heaven and all that jazz
2014-04-01 22:59:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and everything sort of started taking shape after that
2014-04-01 22:59:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my parents never really talked politics with me either, though
2014-04-01 22:59:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but my dad kind of go off on me once when I said I didn't like Bush
2014-04-01 22:59:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is weird
2014-04-01 23:00:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because he is sort of anti-politician
2014-04-01 23:00:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if just thought I was being trendy or what
2014-04-01 23:00:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but ten years later and I'm only further left
2014-04-01 23:00:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sooo
2014-04-01 23:00:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it was a phase
2014-04-01 23:00:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-01 23:03:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dont think I ever really believed in God, or at least I was ambivalent about it
2014-04-01 23:03:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, my views on religion were kinda weird
2014-04-01 23:03:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I think I told you how I thought heaven would be boring when I was a little kid
2014-04-01 23:03:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and how my mom told me there was no hell
2014-04-01 23:03:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I think I just sort of went with it for a while
2014-04-01 23:04:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then my cheerleader girlfriend's grandpa died when we were sophomores
2014-04-01 23:04:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that was the first time I really had to deal with mortality as an "adult"
2014-04-01 23:05:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I just realized I didn't believe any of it
2014-04-01 23:06:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty interesting that you were indifferent or whatever
2014-04-01 23:07:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess church didn't do a good enough job of scaring me 
2014-04-01 23:07:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the mortality thing was a big deal for me... so did you not ever go through that I guess
2014-04-01 23:09:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really dont think so, not in an earth shattering way as you descrbed. Some people close to me and my family have passed away, and I was obviously upset
2014-04-01 23:10:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess eternal life was either a thing or it wasnt, and when I die I'll find out
2014-04-01 23:11:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've been making the joke for a long time now that I dont want to live past 70
2014-04-01 23:11:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think watching myself slowly become decrepit scares me infinitely more
2014-04-01 23:12:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah that's pretty shitty
2014-04-01 23:13:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely can see that, though
2014-04-01 23:13:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like you embrace your youth
2014-04-01 23:14:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I worry a lot about wasting mine
2014-04-01 23:16:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like my youth has been pretty great, few regrets, blah blah blah, I am a little apprehensive about getting stuck later in life
2014-04-01 23:17:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like in a job/family/obligations?
2014-04-01 23:17:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure, something unfulfilling I guess
2014-04-01 23:18:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'd like to think I'm the type of person who would change career paths or whatever if I fellt that were the case
2014-04-01 23:20:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And barring any accidental pregnancies, I definitely don't plan on having kids with someone unless I'm like 200% confident 
2014-04-01 23:20:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just dont want to be in a marriage like my parents
2014-04-01 23:21:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]200% confident in what?
2014-04-01 23:21:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I don't really know your parents situation, you've alluded to it
2014-04-01 23:24:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The marriage and all that
2014-04-01 23:24:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh okay
2014-04-01 23:24:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would just never want a divorce with kids
2014-04-01 23:24:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I guess that's probably not very likely then, huh?
2014-04-01 23:24:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-01 23:25:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah that's a pretty shitty situation
2014-04-01 23:25:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not likely?
2014-04-01 23:25:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]being that confident in a marriage
2014-04-01 23:25:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know, I've never been married ;)
2014-04-01 23:26:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha truth
2014-04-01 23:26:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But my parents just don't love each other much, don't physically interact, and lately my mom is almost mean to my dad
2014-04-01 23:27:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But duty is really important to both of them 
2014-04-01 23:27:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess no one really wants that
2014-04-01 23:28:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my parents were rocky as fuck when I was growing up
2014-04-01 23:28:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they separated for a few months when I was a kid
2014-04-01 23:28:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my dad was mean as fuck
2014-04-01 23:28:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he had legitimate anger issues
2014-04-01 23:28:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sooo yeah
2014-04-01 23:28:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I obviously don't want that
2014-04-01 23:28:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-01 23:29:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he's mellowed out a lot
2014-04-01 23:29:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he's happier now
2014-04-01 23:29:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he's really nice to my mom now
2014-04-01 23:29:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that shit made me really sad/angry when I was a kid
2014-04-01 23:30:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel a little bad telling you that now
2014-04-01 23:30:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why?
2014-04-01 23:30:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-04-01 23:30:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in case you're judging him
2014-04-01 23:30:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which would be completely justified on your part
2014-04-01 23:31:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he knows he fucked up
2014-04-01 23:31:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not, it sounds like he made an effort to change for his family
2014-04-01 23:31:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which is a lot better than most people
2014-04-01 23:31:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely
2014-04-01 23:32:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I try not to judge people I haven't met. Or judge people at all
2014-04-01 23:32:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too    😃 
2014-04-01 23:32:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That made me sound wayyy more saintly than I probably actually am haha
2014-04-01 23:33:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, it's all good
2014-04-01 23:33:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]trying counts
2014-04-01 23:35:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But this conversation turn kinda got me down, sooooo how bout dem White Soxs? Haha 
2014-04-01 23:35:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha how about them?
2014-04-01 23:35:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you gonna check out a game this summer?
2014-04-01 23:36:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't be opposed to it
2014-04-01 23:36:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love going to baseball games
2014-04-01 23:37:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think baseball is kinda boring to watch
2014-04-01 23:37:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I love actually going to the ballpark for games
2014-04-01 23:37:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't been to one since high school, and I never enjoyed them at all 
2014-04-01 23:37:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]might be different as an adult with friends
2014-04-01 23:37:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I think with a group of friends and some beer I could get down with that 
2014-04-01 23:38:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]exactly
2014-04-01 23:38:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, you'll just have to take me to a game sometime
2014-04-01 23:38:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if it sucks, I'll blame you forever 
2014-04-01 23:38:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha

2014-04-01 23:44:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a lottt better
2014-04-01 23:44:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're gonna be in Costa Rica for like a month or something?

2014-04-01 23:45:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was that ever brought into question?
2014-04-01 23:45:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was operating under the assumption this was a bonus trip
2014-04-01 23:45:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-01 23:45:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok good :)

2014-04-01 23:50:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll probably be tired of talking to me so much by then and will appreciate a break :)
2014-04-01 23:51:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I wouldn't bet on it
2014-04-01 23:51:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]absence makes the heart grow fonder?
2014-04-01 23:51:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]extreme absence in that cas
2014-04-01 23:51:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]e
2014-04-01 23:52:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As opposed to the standing absence 
2014-04-01 23:52:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha right
2014-04-01 23:54:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I'm being a little optimistic and jumping the gun, but I think as long as we both want to we could easily get a visit in at least once a month 
2014-04-01 23:54:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I agree
2014-04-01 23:54:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking more of a necessity actually
2014-04-01 23:54:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-01 23:55:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]longer than that gets really tough I think
2014-04-01 23:55:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Agreed
2014-04-01 23:56:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you're a great excuse for me to get some Carolina seafood
2014-04-01 23:56:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'll take it
2014-04-01 23:57:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we sort of got an old-fashioned thing going
2014-04-01 23:57:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like courting by letters
2014-04-01 23:57:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's weird that people would think it's weird kinda
2014-04-01 23:57:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's like romance in the purest form
2014-04-01 23:57:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe, I don't know about pure
2014-04-01 23:58:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like, romance with zero sex? Hahaha
2014-04-01 23:58:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-01 23:58:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-04-01 23:58:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's like romance on the higher plane
2014-04-01 23:58:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]beyond the instinctual stuff
2014-04-01 23:59:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]although the instinctual stuff is definitely thriving I think
2014-04-01 23:59:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just sort of rambling yo
2014-04-02 00:00:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I like when you ramble. And I feel like the 'instinct' stuff was what started this whole thing in a way
2014-04-02 00:00:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah?
2014-04-02 00:00:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe for you
2014-04-02 00:02:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe, but even though we talked a little and you were into me because I liked music and biology and stuff, it still wasn't much to go on
2014-04-02 00:02:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Without the (I assume) physical attraction there too
2014-04-02 00:03:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe
2014-04-02 00:03:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I felt like we had a lot of good convo
2014-04-02 00:04:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'm sorry, I don't mean to question why you first noticed me. I'm just super happy you did 
2014-04-02 00:04:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good. I'm happy too.
2014-04-02 00:05:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even really know what timeframe we're referring to here
2014-04-02 00:05:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Austin?
2014-04-02 00:05:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-04-02 00:07:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bonkers
2014-04-02 00:08:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That might be the best word for all of this
2014-04-02 00:08:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no doubt
2014-04-02 00:08:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's more bonkers to me the more I know
2014-04-02 00:08:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-02 00:09:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why didn't you tell me you were coming to Chicago? Was it cause I wasn't very responsive on Facebook?
2014-04-02 00:10:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah... I guess I just thought that would be kinda like overstepping some bounds or something
2014-04-02 00:10:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like too aggressive?
2014-04-02 00:11:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we didn't really interact at all during those couple of months
2014-04-02 00:11:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I guess I didn't really expect you to necessarily even want to see me
2014-04-02 00:13:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I guess figured I would never see you again. I'm slightly curious if I would've talked to you more knowing you were coming for a week. Cause when I saw that you were here on Facebook, I had a much stronger reaction to it than I would've expected 
2014-04-02 00:14:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought I was def being too pushy by messaging you haha
2014-04-02 00:14:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, that was a pleasant surprise.
2014-04-02 00:14:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Was definitely not expecting that.
2014-04-02 00:16:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alrighty, it's past bedtime for me
2014-04-02 00:17:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha ok
2014-04-02 00:17:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I probably need to take a shower
2014-04-02 00:17:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sweaty as eff
2014-04-02 00:17:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yum
2014-04-02 00:17:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-02 00:18:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight, hopefully your dreams are more pleasant tonight 
2014-04-02 00:19:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]thanks, I hope so. Hopefully thinking about you visiting in a few weeks will keep my brain happy.
2014-04-02 00:19:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet dreams
2014-04-02 00:23:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh and let's actually find a show  or something to go to while I'm there. Maybe if we pick it ahead of time I won't get too tempted to just cuddle half naked on the couch the whole time :)
2014-04-02 00:23:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, goodnight for realz
2014-04-02 00:25:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the half naked cuddling  is  pretty nice, but a show might be fun too
2014-04-02 00:25:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can probably handle both    😃 
2014-04-02 00:26:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If only we could cuddle naked  at  a show, am I right? Lol
2014-04-02 00:27:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah, man! I guess clothed dancing will have to do.
2014-04-02 10:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How do you feel about manscaping?
2014-04-02 10:30:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As long as I can see everything down there and its not like super tangled, I dont care hahah
2014-04-02 10:31:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you're just fine
2014-04-02 10:32:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is there like a too short for you, though?
2014-04-02 10:32:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-04-02 10:32:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-04-02 10:32:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's mostly what I was wondering
2014-04-02 10:33:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wanted to make sure you weren't super turned on by hairiness or something
2014-04-02 10:33:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-02 10:33:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not particularly at all
2014-04-02 10:33:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But while we're on the subject, do you have a preference?
2014-04-02 10:34:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope, whatever makes you feel sexiest
2014-04-02 10:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did noticed you'd shaved this last time, though!
2014-04-02 10:34:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did noticed
2014-04-02 10:34:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yuckkkkkkk
2014-04-02 10:35:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well that was like 30% for you and 70% for my bikini haha, but while in Miami I usually just waxed cause it was easier
2014-04-02 10:36:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And some guys have strong opinions one way or another
2014-04-02 10:37:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope, I guess as long as just like it's not a jungle
2014-04-02 10:37:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-02 10:38:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good answers :)
2014-04-02 10:38:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you have a preference for yourself
2014-04-02 10:38:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just out of curiousity
2014-04-02 10:42:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I usually like to leave a little triangle and take everything else off, because it's a bit more sensitive/enjoyable down there
2014-04-02 10:43:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's cool
2014-04-02 10:46:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you get a little overzealous with the razor today? Haha
2014-04-02 10:46:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no
2014-04-02 10:46:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking of doing a body trim when I cut my hair, though
2014-04-02 10:46:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wanted to make sure I wouldn't be killing my mojo
2014-04-02 10:47:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like your chest too?
2014-04-02 10:47:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah maybe
2014-04-02 10:47:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not shaved
2014-04-02 10:47:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like with a razor
2014-04-02 10:47:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't do that anywhere
2014-04-02 10:47:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but trimmed
2014-04-02 10:47:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless you like it
2014-04-02 10:48:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, cause I feel like when shaved grows back in it would get all prickly on my face 
2014-04-02 10:48:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah not shaved
2014-04-02 10:48:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I kinda like your chest hair :)
2014-04-02 10:48:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok, well I'll leave it be then
2014-04-02 10:49:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whatever makes you feel sexiest 
2014-04-02 10:49:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I feel sexy 100% of the time
2014-04-02 10:49:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just trying to keep you turned on
2014-04-02 10:50:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm definitely not just turned on by you because of your looks. It's the whole package bebe
2014-04-02 10:51:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thoughhh if I get a vote, I probably would enjoy kissing you sans crazy beard
2014-04-02 10:51:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-04-02 10:51:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt I'll ever be bringing that back
2014-04-02 10:52:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that thing was gnarly as eff, though
2014-04-02 10:52:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just a bit
2014-04-02 10:55:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok I have to sign off now for a bit, I need to get my shit straightened out
2014-04-02 10:55:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Starting with my computer 
2014-04-02 10:56:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I'm about to had class and I'll probably go off the grid again.
2014-04-02 10:56:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good luck getting the computer fixed. I'll talk to you later :)
2014-04-02 10:57:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kick some ass today 
2014-04-02 15:33:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Computer guy just pressed some buttons and took out the battery for a second and boom, computer was fine
2014-04-02 15:33:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very weird 
2014-04-02 18:57:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's good to hear
2014-04-02 19:17:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we basically set a date to move in to Darcys (5/20). May is gonna be ridiculously busy 
2014-04-02 19:18:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, sounds like it
2014-04-02 19:18:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]will I be stressing you out if I visit?
2014-04-02 19:19:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You might be the only thing keeping me sane :)
2014-04-02 19:19:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-04-02 19:19:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I can't promise you don't get roped into moving some furniture around haha
2014-04-02 19:19:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-04-02 19:19:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got a lot of experience with that at this point
2014-04-02 19:21:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm booking a flight to Dallas right now.
2014-04-02 19:21:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-04-02 19:21:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So nows the time for objections
2014-04-02 19:22:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope
2014-04-02 19:22:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I object to you suggesting I might have objections
2014-04-02 19:24:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well in case you have a lot if school work or something and the other weekend is better
2014-04-02 19:24:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah, this'll work
2014-04-02 19:25:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Any chance you'll have a car by then?
2014-04-02 19:26:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]doubtful
2014-04-02 19:26:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why?
2014-04-02 19:26:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just wondering. 
2014-04-02 19:27:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In case you could pick me up from the airport
2014-04-02 19:27:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could ask my buddy Carl
2014-04-02 19:28:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah it's ok, I can public transit. I'm sure they have tickets for sale at the airport
2014-04-02 19:28:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmmm I'm actually not sure how that even works
2014-04-02 19:29:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess there are ticket stations at train stops
2014-04-02 19:29:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're flying into Love FIeld?
2014-04-02 19:29:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-04-02 19:30:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what time are you getting in?
2014-04-02 19:31:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Either 12:45 or 2:45
2014-04-02 19:31:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, let me ask Carl
2014-04-02 19:34:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You have class 2-3:30, right?
2014-04-02 19:34:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2:30 - 3:45
2014-04-02 19:35:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might as well get in at 2:45 and take transit so I get to your place like 4:30, right?
2014-04-02 19:36:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That might be optimisitc
2014-04-02 19:36:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess 5 at the latest probably
2014-04-02 19:37:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]eh maybe not
2014-04-02 19:39:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let me ask Carl
2014-04-02 19:39:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if he somehow doesn't mind one of those times, I'll wait and book it tm.
2014-04-02 19:39:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and see what he says
2014-04-02 19:39:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-04-02 19:41:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if he can't I'll get you a shuttle
2014-04-02 19:42:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's silly. I can get my own shuttle 
2014-04-02 19:43:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I would be getting you the shuttle
2014-04-02 19:43:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My computer won't turn on again
2014-04-02 19:43:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maaaaan
2014-04-02 19:43:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that would drive me crazy
2014-04-02 19:44:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I knew that stupid fucking trickery was too good to be true
2014-04-02 19:44:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha    😞 
2014-04-02 19:44:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it's me transporting it in my backpack somehow
2014-04-02 19:44:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt it
2014-04-02 19:45:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless that was a joke
2014-04-02 19:45:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, every time it's done this it's after I've walked home or walked to school with it
2014-04-02 19:46:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm that's weird
2014-04-02 19:46:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know what that would be doing
2014-04-02 19:47:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you think some sort of power connection is loose?
2014-04-02 19:47:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno maybe
2014-04-02 19:48:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just so frustrated 
2014-04-02 19:48:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry    😞 
2014-04-02 19:48:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would be too
2014-04-02 19:48:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It turned on
2014-04-02 19:48:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!!!!!!!
2014-04-02 19:49:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe...
2014-04-02 19:50:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]False alarm. It just made a noise
2014-04-02 19:50:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna go drown it in the bathtub, excuse me 
2014-04-02 19:50:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]noooooooo
2014-04-02 19:51:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't worry, I won't get in with it. I'm not thatttt upset
2014-04-02 19:51:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-02 19:51:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-04-02 19:51:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know man
2014-04-02 19:51:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you didn't notice what the dude did?
2014-04-02 19:52:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He took it in a back room, but then he showed me these buttons to reset the SMC, which I had definitely already tried
2014-04-02 19:53:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I think it was unplugging the battery that helped
2014-04-02 19:53:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you have it plugged in right?
2014-04-02 19:53:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't have the screwdrivers to disconnect the battery, but yes it's plugged in
2014-04-02 19:54:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Actually I think it's on for real now
2014-04-02 19:54:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I don't want to jinx it
2014-04-02 19:54:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't turn it off
2014-04-02 19:54:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Duhhhh
2014-04-02 19:54:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha sorry
2014-04-02 19:54:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well apparently you were doing it before!!
2014-04-02 19:55:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't turn it off, it turned itself off on the walk here!
2014-04-02 19:55:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ohhh
2014-04-02 19:55:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's really weird
2014-04-02 19:55:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah that's gotta be some sort of power thing
2014-04-02 19:56:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your warranty isn't good anymore?
2014-04-02 19:57:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is, but the last time I took it in they found sticky stuff in it
2014-04-02 19:57:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it looked to me like it was leaking out of the battery, but what the fuck do I know
2014-04-02 19:57:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know, you should argue it
2014-04-02 19:58:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Apple is supposed to be good about that stuff I thought
2014-04-02 19:58:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]an unreliable computer is kinda shitty
2014-04-02 20:00:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Agreed
2014-04-02 20:00:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Carl said he could pick you up and the 12:45 time would be better
2014-04-02 20:01:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He must be a pretty good friend 
2014-04-02 20:02:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he's my Mizzou friend
2014-04-02 20:02:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely the closest friend I've got at UTD
2014-04-02 20:03:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hope you buy him lots of drinks as a thank you.
2014-04-02 20:03:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha for sure
2014-04-02 20:03:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, I'll book it
2014-04-02 20:04:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hooray!
2014-04-02 20:04:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:))
2014-04-02 20:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad you 
2014-04-02 20:05:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whoops
2014-04-02 20:05:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad you'll definitely get to meet him this time at least
2014-04-02 20:06:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, get a whole 30 minutes of small talk in lol
2014-04-02 20:06:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you stay on campus I between those classes?
2014-04-02 20:07:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha y'all are both good conversationists, it'll be a good 30
2014-04-02 20:07:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do
2014-04-02 20:11:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hmmm we can figure it out later
2014-04-02 20:12:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe i can get dropped off there and grab some lunch
2014-04-02 20:12:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]aka Chickfila :))
2014-04-02 20:12:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw yeah
2014-04-02 20:14:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just feel like I'm constantly trying to keep my head above water for this Statistics for Machine Learning class
2014-04-02 20:15:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe thats why youre actually doing well in it
2014-04-02 20:15:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe, but it's stressing me out yo!
2014-04-02 20:17:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you were all "grades don't matter, man"
2014-04-02 20:17:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]i am
2014-04-02 20:17:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't like feeling like I don't understand what's going on
2014-04-02 20:18:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sounds like a classic complaint from the smart kid who's used to understanding everything instantly and then is given a challenge    😃 
2014-04-02 20:19:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't know
2014-04-02 20:19:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not the challenge that bother sme
2014-04-02 20:19:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think his notes are way too vague
2014-04-02 20:19:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's usually not clear what we are even supposed to be doing
2014-04-02 20:19:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or at least it's not clear to me
2014-04-02 20:20:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh yeah, i think you've mentioned that complaint about him before
2014-04-02 20:21:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he doesn't really say whether or not the homework problems are even possible
2014-04-02 20:21:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like in our first programming assignment
2014-04-02 20:21:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one of the networks we had to analyze
2014-04-02 20:21:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was like fucking huge
2014-04-02 20:21:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you would've had to really know your shit and have a pretty nice set up to be able to solve it
2014-04-02 20:22:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but he didn't tell us that beforehand
2014-04-02 20:22:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so everyone was just wondering what the fuck was going on
2014-04-02 20:22:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and on this new homework set
2014-04-02 20:22:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it uses sampling to estimate the probability of something
2014-04-02 20:22:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]essentially
2014-04-02 20:22:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the way you generate samples
2014-04-02 20:23:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]makes it basically impossible to get an estimate other than 0.0
2014-04-02 20:23:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the actual probability is not 0.0
2014-04-02 20:23:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I brought this up to him today
2014-04-02 20:24:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he said I need to try this alternative method
2014-04-02 20:24:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even though the homework explicitly says to do it this particular way
2014-04-02 20:24:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and this new way still doesn't work
2014-04-02 20:24:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you get graded on the homeworks?
2014-04-02 20:24:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-04-02 20:24:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty lenient, admittedly
2014-04-02 20:25:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still really frustrating for me, though
2014-04-02 20:25:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can tell
2014-04-02 20:25:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]am I distracting you?
2014-04-02 20:26:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-04-02 20:26:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had to quit with it
2014-04-02 20:28:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we should put the video on sometimes when we're both on computers, even when its just typing
2014-04-02 20:28:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, that's a sweet request
2014-04-02 20:29:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm down
2014-04-02 20:29:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're really into the visual thing
2014-04-02 20:30:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess, just trying to take advantage of technology to the fullest
2014-04-02 20:30:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha makes sense
2014-04-02 20:30:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and it helps to not feel like I'm just communicating with a computer somewhere 
2014-04-02 20:31:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I've set up an A.I. to keep you happy
2014-04-02 20:32:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I knew it!
2014-04-02 20:32:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yeah, just let me know whenever you want to do that
2014-04-02 20:33:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one of the first things I noticed about you is that you make intense eye contact
2014-04-02 20:34:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]really?? thats interesting, because I actually avoid eye contact in general with most people
2014-04-02 20:34:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's really interesting then
2014-04-02 20:34:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz yeah
2014-04-02 20:34:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it makes me kinda uncomfortable and I feel like when I do it i make peoople uncomfortable
2014-04-02 20:34:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's so weird
2014-04-02 20:35:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's exactly what I expect from people
2014-04-02 20:35:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you just verified all my fears
2014-04-02 20:35:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is why I noticed the way you were making eye contact
2014-04-02 20:35:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so like most people will glance away right away when you make eye contact
2014-04-02 20:36:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I felt like you sort of locked and lingered when we made eye contact
2014-04-02 20:36:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I thought that was really interesting
2014-04-02 20:37:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it was a fluke
2014-04-02 20:37:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]are you sure you werent wearing sunglasses? haha
2014-04-02 20:37:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz I noticed it while you were here too
2014-04-02 20:37:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, maybe I'm imagining it
2014-04-02 20:37:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you have really nice warm eyes
2014-04-02 20:38:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I guess I'm really comfortable around you for some reason
2014-04-02 20:38:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*many reasons haha
2014-04-02 20:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice save
2014-04-02 20:39:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]in fact, oncew Dallas called me out on it and asked why I always stare at his eyebrows when I talk to him lol
2014-04-02 20:40:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-02 20:40:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe you're always staring at my eyebrows!
2014-04-02 20:40:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's why you don't look away
2014-04-02 20:40:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]all makes sense now
2014-04-02 20:41:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]whatre you doing now>
2014-04-02 20:41:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]?
2014-04-02 20:41:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]partying
2014-04-02 20:41:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why?
2014-04-02 20:41:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why wasn't I invited?
2014-04-02 20:42:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no girls allowed obviously
2014-04-02 20:45:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'm ok with that haha
2014-04-02 20:46:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm watching some Mad Men, but if you want a muted video in the corner and my eyes dont freak you out, I'd like that    😃 
2014-04-02 20:46:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good
2014-04-02 22:49:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should've said something right away, but would you mind not using "retarded". I used to use it a lot myself, but I now have two exes who have worked with special ed kids and they both did a good job of changing how I perceive the word. I'm not upset at all! I just felt like I had to say something.
2014-04-02 22:53:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh man, I don't even remember when I said it but I'm sorry. I've been trying pretty hard not too the past few years because I put it up there with misusing "gay" and racial slurs, but I guess it still slips occasionally. You should totally call me out if it happens again
2014-04-02 22:55:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, that was the only time I've heard you use it. Caught me a little off guard since you seem to be really aware of how language can influence things! But I'll point it out in the future.
2014-04-02 22:58:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K goodnight
2014-04-02 22:59:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight
2014-04-02 22:59:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry again haha
2014-04-02 22:59:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good!
2014-04-02 22:59:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know there was no mal-intent and old habits die hard yo
2014-04-03 00:13:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.rollingstone.com/feature/millennial-sexual-revolution-relationships-marriage?utm_content=buffer3c205&utm_medium=social&utm_source=plus.google.com&utm_campaign=buffer
2014-04-03 00:13:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haven't read it yet, but seemed like something you'd be interested in
2014-04-03 07:21:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ughhh another bad dream :/
2014-04-03 07:22:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It wasn't really that bad, but it was enough to wake me up stressed out.
2014-04-03 08:51:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a lot of dreams about janky spaceships and trying to save the world 
2014-04-03 09:34:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Pharrell texting me 
2014-04-03 10:07:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-04-03 10:08:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You better tell dream Pharrell to ease up!
2014-04-03 10:09:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah who am I kidding, the dude's got swag
2014-04-03 10:12:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was pretty random all around haha. I don't think he was even trying to get with me, he was trying to get in on a movie deal
2014-04-03 10:13:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol what? What did you have yo do with a movie deal?
2014-04-03 10:13:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have you seen the new FSU logo?
2014-04-03 11:42:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It looks like he's having an orgasm
2014-04-03 11:42:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or is really constipated haha
2014-04-03 11:42:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha I didn't say anything so I wouldn't influence you, but I thought the exact same thing
2014-04-03 11:43:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the orgasm one
2014-04-03 11:44:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty silly 
2014-04-03 11:44:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like, how do you not realize that's what it looks like?
2014-04-03 11:44:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]blows my mind
2014-04-03 11:46:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some graphic designer pulled a fast one on the administrators
2014-04-03 11:46:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'd think a brand as big as FSU would run it by a few different sets of eyeballs before putting it out there, though
2014-04-03 11:46:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-04-03 11:47:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't get moving in time to shower :(
2014-04-03 11:47:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you stank
2014-04-03 11:47:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And now I can't even flush the toilet
2014-04-03 11:48:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha damn
2014-04-03 11:48:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you just slept in?
2014-04-03 11:52:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just groggy and moving slow and sort of forgot about it until 9:30
2014-04-03 11:53:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a rainy dreary cold day
2014-04-03 11:53:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yuck
2014-04-03 11:53:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looking like it's gonna storm here later
2014-04-03 11:53:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but at least it's not cold
2014-04-03 11:53:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I kinda enjoy storms
2014-04-03 11:54:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Running in a summer thunderstorm is one if my all time favorite things to do. But I can't really handle cold rain
2014-04-03 11:55:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't think I've ever heard of someone doing that
2014-04-03 11:55:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but cold rain is definitely my least favorite type of weather
2014-04-03 11:55:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not even close
2014-04-03 11:55:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's probably the case for most people
2014-04-03 12:56:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm hungry and this building is cold. Looks like I'm skipping class.
2014-04-03 13:02:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woah, I'm a little surprised. You don't strike me as the class skipping type
2014-04-03 13:12:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I skip my Computer Architecture class (the undergrad one) on the regular. I never pay attention in the class I'm skipping now. And I just found out I got a 92 on my exam, so I'm not really worried about it. I never skipped class as an undergrad, though.
2014-04-03 13:26:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then it sounds like we've switched in that regard haha.
2014-04-03 13:27:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm starting to think I shouldn't travel around Costa Rica by myself. 
2014-04-03 13:27:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-04-03 13:27:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why's that?
2014-04-03 13:27:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I read a few too many advisories about rape and murder
2014-04-03 13:27:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really?
2014-04-03 13:27:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]shit
2014-04-03 13:28:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-04-03 13:28:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now you definitely can't
2014-04-03 13:28:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-03 13:28:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll be stressing out
2014-04-03 13:29:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, it would probably be fine as it's safer than the countries around it. But it would also probably be more enjoyable if I wasn't über paranoid the entire time
2014-04-03 13:29:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, no doubt
2014-04-03 13:30:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I wish I could join ya!
2014-04-03 13:30:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me tooo. But I'm gonna ask some SAS friends and stuff 
2014-04-03 13:31:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe get the emails of other ppl in the program 
2014-04-03 13:31:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-04-03 15:04:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm a pretty big fan of On Avery Island
2014-04-03 15:04:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm glad :)
2014-04-03 16:21:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you read that article I sent you?
2014-04-03 16:21:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm reading it now and this quote has me loling "Sex isn’t inherently a huge step. At the end of the day, it’s a piece of body touching another piece of body – just as existentially meaningless as kissing."
2014-04-03 16:28:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I read it. I've seen some similar articles in magazines and such that interview people or couples with "unconventional" ideas about relationships, but the statistics were interesting
2014-04-03 16:28:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah there's nothing really revelatory in it
2014-04-03 16:56:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found a subletter for May 17- June 14! It couldn't be any more perfect
2014-04-03 16:57:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it means you'll definitely have to help me move stuff around, which kinda sucks since I wanted as much free time as possible with you
2014-04-03 16:57:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's all good
2014-04-03 16:57:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'll be a bonding moment
2014-04-03 16:57:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's great news, though!
2014-04-03 16:58:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, it makes me feel a lot better about money for summer trips and such
2014-04-03 16:59:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I'm sure that's a good feeling.
2014-04-03 17:05:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's your email 
2014-04-03 17:05:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]airalcorn2@gmail.com
2014-04-03 17:08:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-04-03 17:10:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Big smiles
2014-04-03 20:27:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hope you realize my visit was just engineered so I can get my panties back
2014-04-03 20:27:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-03 20:27:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll take what I can get
2014-04-03 20:28:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you know how I said this homework for stats for ML has been driving me crazy?
2014-04-03 20:28:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've been using the fucking wrong input data the whole time
2014-04-03 20:28:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-04-03 20:28:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ooooooo
2014-04-03 20:28:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's why I'm not getting correct answers
2014-04-03 20:28:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]uggghhhhh
2014-04-03 20:28:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thats the worst
2014-04-03 20:28:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-04-03 20:28:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least it's figured out now, though
2014-04-03 20:29:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should be able to focus on my projects come Monday
2014-04-03 20:29:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'll be ready to roll by the time you get here
2014-04-03 20:30:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool, and I wasn't kidding about study parties 
2014-04-03 20:30:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can get all wrapped around each other with our laptops out haha
2014-04-03 20:30:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, that sounds nice    😃 
2014-04-03 20:34:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how has your day been?
2014-04-03 20:35:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not too bad. Talked to a good friend from undergrad I hadnt talked to in a really long time, had my group meeting for Ethics and ended up leading it somehow, then booked some plane tickets
2014-04-03 20:36:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was your day?
2014-04-03 20:37:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not bad
2014-04-03 20:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]had an exam this morning
2014-04-03 20:37:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]skipped class
2014-04-03 20:37:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]almost done with my programming project for ML
2014-04-03 20:37:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]figured out why this effing stats for ML program isn't working
2014-04-03 20:37:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty productive I reckon
2014-04-03 20:37:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]listened to On Avery Island and Absolution
2014-04-03 20:39:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thoughts on Absolution?
2014-04-03 20:39:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I liked it
2014-04-03 20:39:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was fun to listen to a straight up rock album
2014-04-03 20:39:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't do that enough these days
2014-04-03 20:39:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like head banging material
2014-04-03 20:40:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Hysteria" is one of my all-time favorite songs
2014-04-03 20:40:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that bass line is killer
2014-04-03 20:41:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I feel like you're hard pressed to hear pure rock in recent music
2014-04-03 20:41:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe Black Keys
2014-04-03 20:41:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, The Black Keys for sure
2014-04-03 20:41:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Muse is a little bit harder rock, though
2014-04-03 20:42:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Jack White does rock
2014-04-03 20:42:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]new album coming out!
2014-04-03 20:42:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't listened to too much Jack White
2014-04-03 20:43:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love pretty much everything he touches except for the Dead Weather
2014-04-03 20:43:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess they're The Dead Weather
2014-04-03 20:44:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha thats the only thing I've listened to frequently that he's done. And seen them live
2014-04-03 20:44:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I liked it
2014-04-03 20:44:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like a couple of their tracks, but definitely wouldn't call myself a fan
2014-04-03 20:47:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you like Sigur Ros?
2014-04-03 20:47:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I listened to them a while back
2014-04-03 20:47:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on an airplane
2014-04-03 20:47:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it put me to sleep
2014-04-03 20:47:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-03 20:47:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really remember how I felt about it other than that
2014-04-03 20:50:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They might be a little too abstract for you, from what I'm learning about your tastes. But they can be good sleepy music 
2014-04-03 20:50:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]abstract is a weird way to describe music to me
2014-04-03 20:51:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean by that?
2014-04-03 20:53:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You seem to prioritize lyrics in some cases. And most of the music you like I feel is more structured than Sigur Ros. Except for James Blake 
2014-04-03 20:54:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's still kind of hard for me to grasp
2014-04-03 20:56:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like rock, folk, jazz (in some cases) usually have like an ABBA or ABAB form to them and use more western harmonies
2014-04-03 20:57:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you're saying Sigur Ros breaks those conventions?
2014-04-03 20:57:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like a lot of songs on The Age of Adz aren't really structured
2014-04-03 20:57:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I love that album
2014-04-03 20:58:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I don't know
2014-04-03 20:58:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like the reason I didn't like Sigur Ros is because they were boring to me
2014-04-03 20:58:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah maybe I'm generalizing your tastes, which isn't fair
2014-04-03 20:58:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]give me an example of an "unstructured" song
2014-04-03 20:59:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]By Sigur Ros? Or by anyone
2014-04-03 20:59:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]anyone
2014-04-03 20:59:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Explosions in the sky have some
2014-04-03 21:00:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not good with coming up with song names off the top of my head
2014-04-03 21:01:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-04-03 21:01:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That Darkside album has a couple
2014-04-03 21:05:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess all music seems to have some structure to me
2014-04-03 21:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or else it'd just be noise
2014-04-03 21:05:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's hard for me to come up with a counter example
2014-04-03 21:05:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or an example of what you would describe as "unstructured"
2014-04-03 21:06:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm trying to investigate this myself
2014-04-03 21:06:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be interesting to know
2014-04-03 21:06:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didnt say "unstructured"
2014-04-03 21:06:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just "more structured"
2014-04-03 21:06:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-04-03 21:06:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I can't imagine a "less structured" song
2014-04-03 21:06:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-03 21:07:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like one of the songs we sang fir music night
2014-04-03 21:08:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They have verses and bridges and follow a form, have predictable key changes, resolve their dissonances if they have any
2014-04-03 21:09:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or you can have a song that doesn't even seem to be in a key it's moving around so much, the lyrics never repeat, dissonance is used willy-nilly
2014-04-03 21:09:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ma-l-2izB_s&feature=kp
2014-04-03 21:09:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No clear cadence at the end
2014-04-03 21:10:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is this song structured?
2014-04-03 21:10:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's kinda long
2014-04-03 21:10:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so things like unpredictable key changes, and dissonance are all things I would say I'm okay with
2014-04-03 21:11:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'm still learning what kind of music you like, like I said
2014-04-03 21:12:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just all of your influential/favorite albums didn't really fit in that category
2014-04-03 21:13:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess maybe I find less structured bands boring?
2014-04-03 21:13:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it really has to do with things like dissonance and key changes
2014-04-03 21:13:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as much as they are just boring
2014-04-03 21:13:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but who knows
2014-04-03 21:37:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I wanted to finish reading this paper before I got too sleepy
2014-04-03 21:37:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no worries
2014-04-03 22:53:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The custodian came in my apt today to check that all the faucets were working
2014-04-03 22:54:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was incredibly embarrassing. I have clothes everywhere
2014-04-03 22:54:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like, everywhere
2014-04-03 22:54:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-03 22:54:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure he's seen worse
2014-04-03 22:55:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think clothes on the ground just indicate messiness too
2014-04-03 22:55:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He had to step on a pile of underwear
2014-04-03 22:55:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which isn't as bad as dirtiness, in my opinion
2014-04-03 22:55:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-03 22:55:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]welllll
2014-04-03 22:55:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that might've been a bit much
2014-04-03 22:56:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just dumped out my bags after i got home and havent done laundry yet
2014-04-03 22:56:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe you'll have time this weekend
2014-04-03 22:57:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thats the plan, the longer my apt is like this the unhappier I get
2014-04-03 22:57:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man
2014-04-03 22:57:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't want that
2014-04-03 22:57:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm helping some people with this stats for ML homework now
2014-04-03 22:57:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-03 22:58:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the same thing happened to me on the first assignment
2014-04-03 22:58:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I couldn't figure out for the life of me what I was doing wrong
2014-04-03 22:58:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it ended up being a really small stupid mistake
2014-04-03 22:58:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and my initial understand of the concept was actually correct
2014-04-03 22:58:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]shit's frustrating yo
2014-04-03 22:59:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That sounds like computer science in a nutshell to me
2014-04-03 22:59:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha more programming I would say
2014-04-03 23:00:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the science part was sound!
2014-04-03 23:00:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-04-03 23:00:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're just toooo smart
2014-04-03 23:01:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-03 23:01:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah we'll go with that
2014-04-03 23:02:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm talking to my parents more about getting a car weekend
2014-04-03 23:03:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like we're gonna have a car loan talk
2014-04-03 23:03:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like a loan from them or loan from the bank?
2014-04-03 23:04:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bank
2014-04-03 23:04:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ew
2014-04-03 23:05:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-03 23:05:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's growing up
2014-04-03 23:06:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-04-03 23:06:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you're life will get so much easier with a car
2014-04-03 23:06:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*your ugh
2014-04-03 23:06:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it really will
2014-04-03 23:07:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm really excited about it
2014-04-03 23:07:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll actually be able to do shit
2014-04-03 23:08:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if I ever fly to Dallas again, we wont have to rely on poor Carl
2014-04-03 23:08:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true!
2014-04-03 23:08:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he's completely cool with it, though
2014-04-03 23:09:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had told him we should grab dinner while you're here at lunch that day
2014-04-03 23:09:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that was yesterday
2014-04-03 23:10:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd be down
2014-04-03 23:11:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]our timesheets at UT Southwestern are due on Fridays
2014-04-03 23:11:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's also the last day on the timesheet
2014-04-03 23:12:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I don't know if I'm just supposed to guess how much I'm gonna work that day or what
2014-04-03 23:13:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure someone there can explain it. In past jobs you usually estimate and then they reflect any differences in the next paycheck
2014-04-03 23:13:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, I honestly doubt the dude cares
2014-04-03 23:13:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as long as it's not obviously wrong
2014-04-03 23:15:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yo! So apparently you can buy mobile tickets for DART 
2014-04-03 23:15:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And like show them with your phone
2014-04-03 23:15:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even for the bus?
2014-04-03 23:16:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh this GoPass thing?
2014-04-03 23:16:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-04-03 23:16:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's pretty fancy
2014-04-03 23:16:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've only ever been ticketed once on the train
2014-04-03 23:16:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or asked for my ticket
2014-04-03 23:17:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the bus you have to give them something to get on
2014-04-03 23:17:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you just get on the train
2014-04-03 23:18:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thats how it is in a few European cities, and it's sometimes like "Should I risk just getting on if I can't figure out where to get a ticket?"
2014-04-03 23:18:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-04-03 23:18:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the risk seems really low on DART, though
2014-04-03 23:18:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I'm not sure how they actually get away with it
2014-04-03 23:18:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've rode the train a lot
2014-04-03 23:19:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe Dallas people are really honest?
2014-04-03 23:19:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pshhh
2014-04-03 23:19:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-03 23:19:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'll have to explain the Dallas-Houston rivalry to Carl
2014-04-03 23:19:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he's intrigued by it
2014-04-03 23:20:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He's from Missouri?
2014-04-03 23:20:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yup
2014-04-03 23:21:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's kinda like LA and San Diego, or any other nearby regions
2014-04-03 23:21:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sibling rivalry 
2014-04-03 23:28:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This girl I was friends with in high school just got engaged to her high school sweetheart. Everyone's all freakin out
2014-04-03 23:28:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, that's exciting
2014-04-03 23:30:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess. I'm mostly trying to figure out if I'll be invited to the wedding haha
2014-04-03 23:32:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, what do you think are your odds?
2014-04-03 23:32:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]10%
2014-04-03 23:32:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha bummer?
2014-04-03 23:34:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just want to go to another wedding and eat good food and drink and dance
2014-04-03 23:35:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-03 23:35:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tell more of your friends to get married I guess
2014-04-03 23:36:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've only had one close friend get married I think
2014-04-03 23:36:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now that I'm thinking about it
2014-04-03 23:36:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't even get to go to his wedding
2014-04-03 23:36:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was Zeck
2014-04-03 23:37:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my childhood neighbor
2014-04-03 23:37:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why didn't you go?
2014-04-03 23:37:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was planning on it, but they were having a destination wedding
2014-04-03 23:37:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and ended up making last minute changes
2014-04-03 23:37:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it was when I was in college
2014-04-03 23:37:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was just pretty bad timing for me
2014-04-03 23:39:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the median age of first marriage for men in America is around 29
2014-04-03 23:39:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I guess it makes sense that none of my friends are getting married
2014-04-03 23:40:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, none of my girlfriends are anywhere near a marriage situation (except the one that got married)
2014-04-03 23:41:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder what flips the switch for people
2014-04-03 23:42:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it can't be that it just takes that long to find someone
2014-04-03 23:42:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Finding the right person? Haha
2014-04-03 23:42:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think?
2014-04-03 23:43:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, and I guess different people take different amounts of time/other relationships until they decide they found the "right person"
2014-04-03 23:47:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm getting close to bedtime
2014-04-03 23:47:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooook
2014-04-03 23:49:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're gonna have a pretty hard time getting out of bed at 7am 3 weeks from tomorrow
2014-04-03 23:50:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, man. I guess I'd rather have to face that struggle than not!
2014-04-03 23:51:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't wait, for real
2014-04-03 23:52:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me neither. 
2014-04-03 23:52:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright, good night. No more stressful dreams!
2014-04-03 23:53:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll try my best
2014-04-03 23:53:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet dreams  😘   
2014-04-03 23:53:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oooo a kissy face
2014-04-03 23:54:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Things are getting serious 
2014-04-03 23:54:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-03 23:54:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]another milestone
2014-04-03 23:54:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll mark it on my calendar
2014-04-03 23:55:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just put it on my Google Calendar
2014-04-03 23:55:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"First kissy face with Katie"
2014-04-03 23:55:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You did not
2014-04-03 23:55:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha definitely did
2014-04-03 23:55:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I ain't ashamed
2014-04-03 23:56:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're a dork
2014-04-03 23:56:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha future Michael will definitely appreciate it if he's ever looking at that date again
2014-04-03 23:56:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know what appeals to me
2014-04-03 23:57:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Future Katie will definitely still get a kick out of it too
2014-04-03 23:57:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok goodnight! :*
2014-04-03 23:57:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight    😃 
2014-04-04 10:02:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mother had this idea where I fly into Houston instead on Wednesday, then drive the car up to Dallas myself that afternoon, then you and I drive it up on Saturday and she buys you a plane ticket back to Dallas on Sunday instead of one for my Dad. I guess she thought we'd appreciate a little more time together, but that's a big time suck for you. 
2014-04-04 10:04:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Think about it and let me know, I would totally understand if you don't want to do that.
2014-04-04 10:24:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I think she's trying to find a way to see me too lol
2014-04-04 13:33:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wow! That's really nice of her. I think I could not probably do it. We'll talk about it more later :)
2014-04-04 13:34:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know why that not is there.
2014-04-04 13:34:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I probably COULD do it.
2014-04-04 13:36:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha ok. Yeah I kinda like that plan a lot the more I think about it, but we can chat after you're done working. She just wants to book a ticket before tm 
2014-04-04 17:09:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. I can't really think of a reason this wouldn't work, so I think we should go for it!
2014-04-04 17:12:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think the only issue is making sure you can get home from the airport on Sunday, which might end up depending on Carl/someone to pick you up. 
2014-04-04 17:12:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I could do a shuttle worse case scenario.
2014-04-04 17:13:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are you gonna do about that flight you booked? Can you change cities?
2014-04-04 17:13:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Worst*
2014-04-04 17:13:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah SW has no change fees woo woo
2014-04-04 17:14:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha sweet.
2014-04-04 17:15:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you talk on the phone really quick?
2014-04-04 17:16:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm on the bus right now and it's kinda loud, but we can try!
2014-04-04 17:16:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll text it's ok
2014-04-04 17:18:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Option 1) ORD 6:25p -> DFW 9:18p (my personal favorite) 2) ORD 9:15a -> DFW 11:42a 
2014-04-04 17:18:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1 for sure :)
2014-04-04 17:19:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A shuttle is only $30, and since these flights are way cheaper than any of the ones to Houston my mom can cover it if you can't get a ride 
2014-04-04 17:20:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's okay, she's done more than enough!
2014-04-04 17:21:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess she's convinced I'm not an axe murderer anymore?
2014-04-04 17:22:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Apparently dad wants to play in a golf tournament that weekend, so we may have him to thank haha. But I think she can tell that you make me happy and she's all about that
2014-04-04 17:24:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I can appreciate that. And I like how your dad prioritizes things.
2014-04-04 17:32:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok I'm about to book! 
2014-04-04 17:32:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you think grandparents will always sound completely bonkers on Facebook? Or do you think it has more to do with being used to the Internet?
2014-04-04 17:32:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do it!
2014-04-04 17:32:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's your date of birth?
2014-04-04 17:32:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]10/12/1987
2014-04-04 17:33:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you male or female?
2014-04-04 17:33:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol
2014-04-04 17:35:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think they will always sound bonkers. They're approaching it in a completely different way than those who grew up with it and have their own different social priorities 
2014-04-04 17:36:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But do you think our generation will sound bonkers when they're grandparents?
2014-04-04 17:37:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To the younger generation, absolutely 
2014-04-04 17:37:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah. That might be kinda fun. Just completely unfiltered.
2014-04-04 17:38:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My flight is on my momma's birthday.
2014-04-04 17:38:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What a coinky dink
2014-04-04 17:39:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]4 whole nights with you sounds pretty great 
2014-04-04 17:40:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yes, ma'am.
2014-04-04 17:43:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was the internship today?
2014-04-04 17:44:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not bad. I didn't get into any analysis stuff, unfortunately. But I have access to the cluster now, so I can start getting more familiar with the actual pipeline they're using.
2014-04-04 17:44:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got some free lunch for going to a seminar.
2014-04-04 17:44:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Seemed like stuff a lot of Darwinians would've been intom
2014-04-04 17:44:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Into.
2014-04-04 17:53:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty tight. I feel like I was busy all day but didn't really accomplish anything. I think I might go drink with Haley in celebration of her committee meeting tonight
2014-04-04 17:59:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think that was the deepest subway I've ever been on.
2014-04-04 18:00:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was three long escalators down.
2014-04-04 18:01:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you taking a different route than usual?
2014-04-04 18:01:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't even know Texas cities had subways 
2014-04-04 18:03:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This is my first time taking public transit home. It's the same train route, though. But I've never gotten on the train at that particular station, so I had no idea how far underground I was.
2014-04-04 18:05:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd you get home the other times?
2014-04-04 18:06:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]One of the dudes is also a UTD student. He's been giving me a ride.
2014-04-04 18:08:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty nice. People seem to like you pretty quickly
2014-04-04 18:09:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? I guess I was sort of aware of that. I like meeting new people and making new friends.
2014-04-04 18:10:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Missed my effing bus. Next one isn't until 6:35
2014-04-04 18:11:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Guess it could be worse, but Dallas transit really seems to suck 
2014-04-04 18:12:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's really bad for where I live.
2014-04-04 18:13:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Basically south of the stop I'm currently at, you can get around okay. But things get really shitty further north.
2014-04-04 18:13:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wonder why UTD is located so far north
2014-04-04 18:15:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not even in Dallas. It's in Richardson. They just use Dallas to give it more appeal.
2014-04-04 18:16:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you have a preferred facial hair length?
2014-04-04 18:16:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Obviously not epic beard
2014-04-04 18:16:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're so funny about that stuff
2014-04-04 18:17:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As long as your happy, I'm happy. 
2014-04-04 18:17:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*you're
2014-04-04 18:18:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just trying to maximize attractiveness yo. I don't personally care, so I might as well do what you like.
2014-04-04 18:18:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The length it was when you were in Chicago was pretty great
2014-04-04 18:19:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha okay. I'd be lying if I said I didn't plan that.
2014-04-04 18:19:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you obviously have an idea of what the ladies like haha
2014-04-04 18:20:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know what has worked historically. But tastes aren't universal!
2014-04-04 18:21:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if that's actually true. I wonder if there's a girl out there who finds me unattractive.
2014-04-04 18:22:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess things like symmetry have been shown to be kinda universally attractive.
2014-04-04 18:23:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well "out there" is kind of broad. You probably aren't nearly as appealing in different countries, for example
2014-04-04 18:23:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You think so?
2014-04-04 18:24:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I can see less appealing, but actually unattractive?
2014-04-04 18:24:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It'd be interesting to test.
2014-04-04 18:24:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't quite see the distinction between the two
2014-04-04 18:25:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So rather than an 8 I'm a 7 in two different countries. As opposed to like an 8 and a 4.
2014-04-04 18:25:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like still bangable vs not bangable
2014-04-04 18:26:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not all women really think that way, in terms of "bangability"
2014-04-04 18:27:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially in other cultures
2014-04-04 18:27:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or they subconsciously factor in other considerations than just physical attributes
2014-04-04 18:28:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I get that. But I'm just concerned with physical attractiveness here.
2014-04-04 18:29:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm saying the two are inseperable
2014-04-04 18:29:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For most females
2014-04-04 18:30:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So women don't ever asses the physical attractiveness of a dude until they've interacted with him?
2014-04-04 18:30:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol asses
2014-04-04 18:30:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Assess
2014-04-04 18:31:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No they do, but the physical attributes you have are not equally valued by all women everywhere.
2014-04-04 18:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I knowwww
2014-04-04 18:31:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's what I'm trying to figure out.
2014-04-04 18:32:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Would I become ugly somewhere else? Or would I still be decent looking, just less attractive.
2014-04-04 18:32:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know what to say, I find you attractive but I'm pretty sure not every single woman on the planet has the same tastes as me
2014-04-04 18:33:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You might be "ugly" in India for example 
2014-04-04 18:33:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's exactly what I'm asking.
2014-04-04 18:33:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So do you think that's actually the case or not?
2014-04-04 18:36:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I have no idea, you'll have to take a survey
2014-04-04 18:37:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like a plan.
2014-04-04 18:39:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The other UTD guy was rocking way too much cologne today.
2014-04-04 18:42:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe it was too much for you, but the ladies love it? Haha
2014-04-04 18:42:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you work at a desk next to him?
2014-04-04 18:43:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He's like 10 feet away. You could smell it anywhere in the office space, though.
2014-04-04 18:43:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think he had a date or something. I'm guessing that's why he couldn't give me a ride.
2014-04-04 18:54:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like I"m gonna be using my sister's car for the summer
2014-04-04 18:58:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's cool? 
2014-04-04 19:00:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it saves us some money
2014-04-04 19:00:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would mean I'm still trapped in Dallas, though
2014-04-04 19:00:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless this is just buying us some time to figure out a long term solution
2014-04-04 19:01:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my sister just told me about it so I haven't heard my parents' perspective yet
2014-04-04 19:02:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can always buy my 2001 car for $3000
2014-04-04 19:03:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so y'all haven't sold that yet?
2014-04-04 19:03:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nope. It's in pretty good condition, though it probably won't last longer than 5 years 
2014-04-04 19:05:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah... hmm I don't know. It'd probably best for me and the fam to go with my sister's car for the summer and then just find something really cheap to get me through my last two semesters.
2014-04-04 19:05:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Once I have a job I'll be able to get something reasonable (hopefully)
2014-04-04 19:09:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I was just throwing it out there. I'm sure you can get something for like $1500 that'll last you that long
2014-04-04 19:09:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah exactly
2014-04-04 19:10:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though the CR-V's trade in price is $4000, you could probably make a profit off it haha
2014-04-04 19:15:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm in more of a can't afford it in the first place situation
2014-04-04 19:18:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just kidding around, I don't really care if they sell it. I don't stand to gain/lose from it
2014-04-04 19:18:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word.
2014-04-04 19:19:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]any plans for the night?

2014-04-04 19:19:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-04-04 19:20:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm pretty tired from the week, so I wouldn't mind just chilling at home

2014-04-04 19:22:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my plan is to get as much of this project shit done before you get here
2014-04-04 19:22:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'll be able to just relax and enjoy it
2014-04-04 19:23:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've got three projects do at the end of this month
2014-04-04 19:24:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you ever sleep on your arm and it falls asleep?
2014-04-04 20:03:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am all for this plan of getting ahead, and I don't want to feel like I'm causing you to get behind.b
2014-04-04 20:04:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely wake up to my arm asleep sometimes, esp since I sleep on my stomach/arm a lot 
2014-04-04 20:04:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you ever masturbate? Haha
2014-04-04 20:04:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha uhh yeah

2014-04-04 20:06:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe that's what I was just doing... :)
2014-04-04 20:07:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-04 20:07:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was wondering where you went
2014-04-04 20:07:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's been a long week 
2014-04-04 20:07:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how you just gonna drop out of conversation to masturbate
2014-04-04 20:07:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-04 20:07:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm loling over here
2014-04-04 20:11:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean it's texting, I'm not inherently obligated to respond immediately 
2014-04-04 20:12:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whoa
2014-04-04 20:12:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok

2014-04-04 20:29:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry, didn't mean to come across rude.
2014-04-04 20:29:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going out, I'll talk to you later
2014-04-04 21:49:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't like being out thinking you're sour with me for some reason
2014-04-04 21:52:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sour!
2014-04-04 21:52:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sorry
2014-04-04 21:53:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have a fun night... I'm trying to code up some value iteration
2014-04-04 21:53:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]get that optimal policy going
2014-04-04 21:54:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok cool, that makes me feel better. I'm at Chant now with Haley, Tim, Christina, Molly and some others
2014-04-04 21:54:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like a good group

2014-04-04 22:40:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-04-04 23:12:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've come up a couple of time. I mentioned that you were gonna be here in a few weeks, I hope that's ok
2014-04-04 23:12:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for sure! I'm not sure why that wouldn't be ok, actually
2014-04-04 23:14:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, I guess taking this thing public 
2014-04-04 23:14:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I have no idea how private it is
2014-04-04 23:15:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we posted pictures of each other on Facebook while you were in Dallas
2014-04-04 23:15:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought that was pretty public
2014-04-04 23:15:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-04 23:16:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True, and Misha and Tim commented on it. I guess they're more your friends than mine, so I didn't know if you wanted to say something
2014-04-04 23:16:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno I'm drunk
2014-04-04 23:16:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-04 23:18:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well you can talk about us as much or as little as you like as far as I'm concerned
2014-04-04 23:19:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't have any reservations talking about us
2014-04-04 23:26:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess as long as you're drunk I should probably tell you that I'm stilll really into you
2014-04-04 23:26:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more now than I was before    😃 
2014-04-05 00:49:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, I was afraid you were annoyed/acting petty at me before (which would suck)
2014-04-05 00:49:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm at Haleys now. 
2014-04-05 00:49:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really wish you were here 
2014-04-05 00:50:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too
2014-04-05 00:50:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm still very into you
2014-04-05 00:51:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So into you I'm scared 
2014-04-05 00:52:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]scared of what?
2014-04-05 00:52:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My feelings I guess 
2014-04-05 00:53:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]scared of them being hurt?
2014-04-05 00:55:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe we should lay off this convo for now if you're inebriated
2014-04-05 00:56:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Perhaps 
2014-04-05 00:59:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just hope you know, how much I think about you 
2014-04-05 00:59:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃  that's nice to hear 
2014-04-05 00:59:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think about you a lot too
2014-04-05 01:03:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what's going on at Haley's?
2014-04-05 01:04:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We smoked and now playing Cards Against Science 
2014-04-05 01:05:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is it?

2014-04-05 01:06:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]super fun. I'll probably sleep here so I don't have to go home this late 
2014-04-05 01:07:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, that's a long walk
2014-04-05 01:12:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Counting down the days until you're in my bed. Goodnight darling
2014-04-05 01:13:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can't wait to see you. sweet dreams
2014-04-05 07:39:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]View from their apt, pretty amazing 
2014-04-05 08:38:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Very pretty.
2014-04-05 08:39:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't let it fool you, it's still freezing outside 
2014-04-05 08:40:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I actually thought to myself "Looks cold"
2014-04-05 08:40:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Still pretty, though
2014-04-05 08:41:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am a littleeee bit hungover. We took a couple shots of Jack last night and they snuck up on me
2014-04-05 08:43:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. Seems like you had a fun night at least.
2014-04-05 08:44:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Miley Cyrus is gonna be attending UChicago haha
2014-04-05 08:45:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No way
2014-04-05 08:46:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I just saw someone posted the story on Jon's Facebook.
2014-04-05 08:46:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That could be interesting.
2014-04-05 08:47:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm a little suspicious
2014-04-05 08:47:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]" What university officials failed to comment on was a large endowment the Cyrus family reportedly gave to the university last Christmas. There are plans to break ground for a future Earl Cyrus Jr. School of Gender, Sexuality, and Intersectionality, named for Cyrus’ maternal grandfather, a retired Marathon Oil service station manager in Flatwoods, Kentucky."
2014-04-05 08:47:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since the article I'm reading came out on April Fools
2014-04-05 08:48:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah damn
2014-04-05 08:48:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're definitely right.
2014-04-05 08:48:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hate April Fool's day. I actively avoid news for exactly this reason.
2014-04-05 08:49:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's silly
2014-04-05 08:50:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean... it's not even funny.
2014-04-05 08:50:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Agreed
2014-04-05 08:50:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok I'm going back to sleep with kitty
2014-04-05 08:50:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha ok

2014-04-05 08:50:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it's gonna be a lazy Saturday 
2014-04-05 08:51:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wish I could be lazy with you!
2014-04-05 08:51:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmm, some morning sex would definitely make me feel better
2014-04-05 08:52:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ughhh, do want.
2014-04-05 12:14:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You must have a pretty impressive memory to remember a Facebook post from 2009
2014-04-05 12:14:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-04-05 12:14:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, haha
2014-04-05 12:15:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I forgot that that would show up
2014-04-05 12:15:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just looking through old posts
2014-04-05 12:19:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I feel ya
2014-04-05 12:20:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really wanted to make a pie for Colin's BBQ but I think I slept in too late
2014-04-05 12:20:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw, man
2014-04-05 12:20:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure there'll be more opportunities in the future
2014-04-05 12:22:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When's the BBQ?
2014-04-05 12:22:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It started at 12, with ribs coming off around 2
2014-04-05 12:22:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's goes all day I guess
2014-04-05 12:22:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-04-05 12:23:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I forget where he lives now
2014-04-05 12:23:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know he lives with Alice
2014-04-05 12:23:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I only went there once
2014-04-05 12:23:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are they dating?
2014-04-05 12:23:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-04-05 12:23:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for like a long time
2014-04-05 12:23:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least as long as I've known them
2014-04-05 12:24:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha ok that's what I figured, but I don't think I've ever seen them act affectionate
2014-04-05 12:24:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just always together 
2014-04-05 12:25:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess they aren't super obvious about it, but if you hang around them enough you'll see occasional PDA. I've got a pic of them kissing somewhere on Facebook
2014-04-05 12:56:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just crawled back in bed....I might not even make it to the bbq
2014-04-05 12:56:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not feeling too hot?
2014-04-05 12:57:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel ok, just tired and lazy 
2014-04-05 12:57:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, you should make an appearance
2014-04-05 12:57:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's actually a gorgeous day outside 
2014-04-05 12:58:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even more reason to get out there
2014-04-05 13:00:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They aren't gonna have the final 4 on :/
2014-04-05 13:00:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]booooo
2014-04-05 13:00:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna have to stream it
2014-04-05 13:01:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]some B.S. not having it on network TV
2014-04-05 13:01:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Seriously, wtf
2014-04-05 13:01:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How do you stream it? 
2014-04-05 13:01:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are a bunch of sites
2014-04-05 13:02:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I typically use this one -->  http://www.firstrows.eu/
2014-04-05 13:02:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not very good quality
2014-04-05 13:02:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's better than nothing
2014-04-05 13:02:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sometimes the streams aren't bad
2014-04-05 13:02:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]make sure you use an ad blocker
2014-04-05 13:05:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks, maybe I can convince someone to hook their computer up to the tv
2014-04-05 13:33:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]  These are kind of funny  http://mentalfloss.com/article/53690/11-sexting-acronyms-1930s
2014-04-05 13:35:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha wow, those are great
2014-04-05 13:35:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder how the meaning got established?
2014-04-05 13:36:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They must've sent at least one with the actual definition. Or word of mouth from soldiers on leave
2014-04-05 13:37:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty interesting that they became standard
2014-04-05 13:38:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and awesome that 18-22 year olds have have always been laughably horny
2014-04-05 13:39:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was probably even worse then. No internet porn, stuck in the trenches with a bunch of other dudes
2014-04-05 13:40:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't know, I feel like 18-22 year olds are still pretty raunchy
2014-04-05 13:41:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now you've got dick pics and stuff on top of all that
2014-04-05 13:41:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-05 13:42:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah definitely raunchier, just different levels of horniness from sexual frustration 
2014-04-05 13:44:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I guess that's possible
2014-04-05 13:46:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]EGYPT
2014-04-05 13:47:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]China
2014-04-05 13:47:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]VENICE
2014-04-05 13:47:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahahaha
2014-04-05 13:48:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I think I might prefer these to dick pics
2014-04-05 13:49:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm trying to come up with one
2014-04-05 13:55:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Always Fucking Ready (for) Intercourse (with) Alcorn

2014-04-05 13:57:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I misspelled Africa!
2014-04-05 13:57:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This one is boring
2014-04-05 13:57:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]CLIMATE Come lie, I'm All Too Excited
2014-04-05 13:57:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought you were doing InterCourse

2014-04-05 13:57:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh, yeah that's totally what I meant...

2014-04-05 14:02:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if that's the first time those words have ever been combined like that
2014-04-05 14:03:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can't be, when it comes to sex I doubt anything hasn't been done or said before
2014-04-05 14:04:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe, but I can't imagine too many people in history have tried to come up with a sexual BIOLOGY acronym

2014-04-05 18:27:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I wasn't sure of the rule
2014-04-05 18:28:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you mean, the rule?

2014-04-05 23:17:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha we almost did and then decided to talk about it another night when we all watch Alien
2014-04-05 23:17:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ooh fun.
2014-04-05 23:20:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like a good night. I wanted to say goodnight but if you're busy we can video tm 
2014-04-05 23:23:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We can video now
2014-04-05 23:26:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The cat just broke the mirror, hold on
2014-04-05 23:26:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh shit!
2014-04-06 09:00:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good morning, beautiful. I hope you have a nice breakfast!
2014-04-06 09:22:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good morning handsome. Moving a little slow over here today
2014-04-06 10:05:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is there a way to hide individuals from your Instagram stream without unfollowing them? My cousin spams pics of her kids.
2014-04-06 10:05:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, you just have to unfollow them and hope they don't take offense 
2014-04-06 10:07:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Alright, thanks.
2014-04-06 11:18:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The buzzed head/beard makes me think of Edward Norton in American History X for some reason  
2014-04-06 11:40:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it's kind of badass looking
2014-04-06 11:40:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just videoing with my dad
2014-04-06 11:40:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]trying to nail down this car situation
2014-04-06 11:41:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might be flying out to San DIego and driving to Dallas
2014-04-06 11:41:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's option one
2014-04-06 11:41:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the one I prefer
2014-04-06 11:41:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and option two is I fly up to Chicago May 12-16
2014-04-06 11:41:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my dad drives to Dallas
2014-04-06 11:41:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we drive to Atlanta together
2014-04-06 11:41:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I drive to Raleigh myself from there
2014-04-06 11:43:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like some good options. If you need that time in May to go get the car, don't worry about coming to see me
2014-04-06 11:43:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can work out another visit time
2014-04-06 11:43:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah this would be Like May 2nd
2014-04-06 11:43:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the reason I prefer that one is because I get to see you up until I have to leave for Raleigh
2014-04-06 11:44:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really want to see you, that's a top priority!
2014-04-06 11:44:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, but I don't want to make things complicated with your dad and getting the car
2014-04-06 11:45:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You could also look into shipping it from SD to Dallas. Might be cheaper than the plane ticket + gas
2014-04-06 11:47:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd probably take too long I imagine
2014-04-06 11:47:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're trying to minimize the amount of time my sister is without her car
2014-04-06 11:48:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]while still allowing me to get it
2014-04-06 11:48:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it looks like that's pretty expensive
2014-04-06 11:48:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and my mom wants to see me
2014-04-06 11:48:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which might be the most important factor
2014-04-06 11:48:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-06 11:48:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha true
2014-04-06 11:49:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]regardless, I'm gonna be visiting you sometime that week
2014-04-06 11:49:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that is not in question
2014-04-06 11:49:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok :)
2014-04-06 12:06:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually haven't seen American History X
2014-04-06 13:40:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I went back to sleep
2014-04-06 13:40:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like wtf is wrong with me
2014-04-06 13:40:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-06 13:41:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lots of drinking and not a lof great sleep?
2014-04-06 13:41:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe, sounds plausible 
2014-04-06 13:41:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm feeling kinda sleepy myself.
2014-04-06 13:41:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all rainy out.
2014-04-06 13:43:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need help cleaning up my mirror
2014-04-06 13:43:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you gonna toss it?
2014-04-06 13:44:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I have to
2014-04-06 13:44:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I couldn't really tell how messed up it was
2014-04-06 13:44:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like still stuck together but floppy
2014-04-06 13:44:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, yeah looks pretty broken
2014-04-06 13:44:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I can't figure out how to take it to the big trash can alone
2014-04-06 13:44:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder who gets the seven years of bad luck in this case?
2014-04-06 13:45:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hopefully me, I don't want flo to suffer for the majority of her life
2014-04-06 13:45:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well ain't that sweet
2014-04-06 13:46:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't have a box or something to put it in?
2014-04-06 13:46:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That would require me breaking the back part to fold it together 
2014-04-06 13:47:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh okay, so it's not stable enough to carry... but also not broken enough to make smaller?
2014-04-06 13:47:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly 
2014-04-06 13:48:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol bummer
2014-04-06 13:48:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or I just need another person to carry it
2014-04-06 13:48:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you should come over now
2014-04-06 13:48:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok, gimme a minute

2014-04-06 13:56:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's a bit of an investment

2014-04-06 18:53:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably get a hotel that night
2014-04-06 18:53:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and get to Chicago reasonably earlier the 13th
2014-04-06 18:54:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*early
2014-04-06 18:55:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I also told them I'll be driving up with you
2014-04-06 18:55:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they think it's funny your mom bought me a ticket
2014-04-06 18:55:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they also think it's funny what she said about the axe murderer thing
2014-04-06 18:55:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my mom asked me what you study
2014-04-06 18:56:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's gonna be a crazy month and a half
2014-04-06 18:56:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but very exciting!
2014-04-06 18:57:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I've told you this already, but my mom volunteers on whale watching tours.
2014-04-06 18:57:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And they saw a sunfish this week
2014-04-06 18:57:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought that was pretty cool
2014-04-06 19:17:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When's the flight?
2014-04-06 19:17:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]May 3rd
2014-04-06 19:17:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]8:47 AM
2014-04-06 19:17:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yowza
2014-04-06 19:18:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ew. If you're getting a hotel not too far away from me, maybe I can drive down and meet you. But we'll see
2014-04-06 19:19:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that might be nice    😃 
2014-04-06 19:27:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are they worried I'm an axe murderess 
2014-04-06 19:27:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no I don't think so
2014-04-06 19:40:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is what my brother texted me
2014-04-06 19:40:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-06 19:40:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what
2014-04-06 19:41:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and aren't salsa lids metal?
2014-04-06 20:01:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I definitely had to retract that statement 
2014-04-06 20:01:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha good call
2014-04-06 20:03:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would love to see a sunfish
2014-04-06 20:03:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm jealous
2014-04-06 20:04:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too. She's got a pretty sweet gig with that.
2014-04-06 21:47:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Game of Thrones didn't disappoint in the gratuitous violence and full frontal nudity 
2014-04-06 21:47:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-04-06 21:47:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do they show penis on that show?
2014-04-06 21:48:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They have shown a couple flaccid ones
2014-04-06 21:48:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'm pretty sure you're not allowed to show erect penises without it being considered porn
2014-04-06 21:48:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still, not many shows even showing flaccid dicks these days
2014-04-06 21:51:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, it's still definitely skewed towards naked women 
2014-04-06 21:53:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I remember getting a healthy dose of sex in the few episodes I watched.
2014-04-06 22:04:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What else did you tell your mom about me? I'm curious
2014-04-06 22:05:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that was it I think
2014-04-06 22:06:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she asked if I was going to get to meet your parents
2014-04-06 22:06:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz I guess she was expecting me to meet your dad before
2014-04-06 22:06:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I told her you were my inspiration for seeing Arcade Fire in Houston
2014-04-06 22:07:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And just because they're awesome
2014-04-06 22:07:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meeting my dad is a pretty non-event 
2014-04-06 22:07:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He seems to take zero interest in my social life
2014-04-06 22:08:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, oh okay
2014-04-06 22:08:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's Momma Silliman who's approval you might need to win at some point
2014-04-06 22:08:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-04-06 22:08:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]parents typically seem to like me
2014-04-06 22:09:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I ain't scurrrred
2014-04-06 22:09:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha good to know 
2014-04-06 22:09:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna read a little bit then pass out. I'll talk to you tomorrow
2014-04-06 22:10:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sleep tight
2014-04-06 22:10:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet dreams  😘   
2014-04-06 22:10:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah 
2014-04-06 23:12:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought I had slept so much
2014-04-06 23:12:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:/
2014-04-06 23:12:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've already fallen asleep and waken up?
2014-04-06 23:12:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess s
2014-04-06 23:12:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man
2014-04-06 23:12:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not Tuesday is it?
2014-04-06 23:13:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're a light sleeper I guess?
2014-04-06 23:13:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no
2014-04-06 23:13:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still Sun
2014-04-06 23:13:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not always, just maybe I was still too full or something 
2014-04-06 23:14:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Simon is too good of a cook sometimes and I have no self control
2014-04-06 23:14:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, I'm starting to realize
2014-04-07 01:05:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Making me sound like some kind of glutton haha
2014-04-07 13:11:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey, ____ (still don't know what to call you, haha). How's your day going?
2014-04-07 13:12:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha no need to feel pressured to call me anything 
2014-04-07 13:13:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Day is good and productive. Doing some laundry and reading stuff for Speciation 
2014-04-07 13:13:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But "Katie" feels really formal to me and not affectionate.
2014-04-07 13:13:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like a good start, though.
2014-04-07 13:14:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like when people call me by my name, as opposed to just "Hey" or "Good night"
2014-04-07 13:14:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's your day going?
2014-04-07 13:15:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Alright. I'll try to get used to the fact I'm just using your name.
2014-04-07 13:16:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And it's going alright. Getting that sense of being overwhelmed again. I'm not sure what I'll do if I ever reach a point in my life where that's not the case.
2014-04-07 13:23:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]School stress sucks for sure
2014-04-07 13:24:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The only way I can really deal with it is use it positively as a way to fuel myself to get things done. And it sounds like you've been doing pretty well so far! 
2014-04-07 13:34:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I guess it's just felt kinda relentless and never ending recently. I'll get through it. Just helps me to be able to express it to someone who cares :)
2014-04-07 13:36:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Always happy to help :)
2014-04-07 13:37:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you're almost in the final stretch before summer! 
2014-04-07 13:38:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah, trying to keep that in mind. I only really have about four weeks of craziness left.
2014-04-07 13:41:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hopefully in 16 days you can get a little stress relief in 
2014-04-07 13:41:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Man, I can't tell you how much I'm looking forward to that.
2014-04-07 13:42:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How do you describe our relationship to people? Do you say like "dating", " seeing", "boyfriend", etc.?
2014-04-07 13:44:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess anyone I've talked to about it at this point I've explained the story, and that we have  plans to see each other coming up, and that we're seeing what happens
2014-04-07 13:45:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. That's a good way to put it.
2014-04-07 13:46:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why what do you say?
2014-04-07 13:47:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I just said "dating" to this friend of mine and it seemed kinda weird and inaccurate haha
2014-04-07 13:47:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I don't think I've ever actually said I was dating someone before.
2014-04-07 13:48:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Explaining the whole situation it comes up might be overkill, though haha.
2014-04-07 13:48:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*every time it comes up
2014-04-07 13:50:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it probably won't come up that often in the future. Only really needs explained once, haha.
2014-04-07 13:50:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I just mean to like my good friends from home or w/e
2014-04-07 13:51:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It hasn't really come up that much here, and I'm not necessarily the type to talk openly about my personal life
2014-04-07 13:53:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I dig. Yeah it's not really a big deal haha. I was just curious because I found myself wondering what to say in that situation.
2014-04-07 14:20:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You seem to have a tendency to think and care a lot about the details of us, which is great because it shows how invested you are! But I'm sure some of the specifics will work themselves out naturally with time
2014-04-07 14:24:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, man. I realized after sending that that I sounded kinda clingy and that really wasn't my intent. It was motivated by curiosity. But I am totally invested, so I can deal with it coming off that way if that's how you interpreted it.
2014-04-07 14:30:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not clingy at all, and obviously if something's on your mind you should ask. I'm just not the type to get hung up on labels.
2014-04-07 14:31:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds good to me. Well class is about to start. I'll talk to you later, Katie :)
2014-04-07 14:31:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bye!
2014-04-07 17:49:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you doing anything fun to watch the game tn?
2014-04-07 17:50:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh shit
2014-04-07 17:50:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't even realize it was tonight
2014-04-07 17:50:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking it was this weekend for some reason
2014-04-07 17:50:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the answer to that question is "no"
2014-04-07 17:50:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should probably hit up Carl
2014-04-07 17:50:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what about you?
2014-04-07 17:51:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm glad I reminded you then! It's on CBS so you should be able to get it. Adam Hardy is having some people over
2014-04-07 17:51:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I'm definitely glad you reminded me. I would've coded right through it, haha.
2014-04-07 17:51:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And that sounds like a good time.
2014-04-07 17:52:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You gonna bring anything?
2014-04-07 17:53:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, they have a whole HD setup which is pretty tight. I'm probably just gonna bring some beer and chips. I just cleaned my kitchen and can't bring myself to get it messy again just yet
2014-04-07 17:53:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, I can respect that.
2014-04-07 17:55:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did I ask you who you're picking?
2014-04-07 17:55:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't have either of them, but I guess Kentucky
2014-04-07 17:56:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Their defense is pretty great when they're on
2014-04-07 17:56:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No doubt. That's the way I'm leaning too.
2014-04-07 17:56:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess no bets this time.
2014-04-07 17:57:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you mean, bets?
2014-04-07 17:57:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if we were picking against each other we could put something on the line
2014-04-07 17:57:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhhh
2014-04-07 17:58:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably for the best, I have bad luck with gambling as we've discussed
2014-04-07 17:58:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, well it didn't necessarily have to be money
2014-04-07 18:00:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still don't like losing :P
2014-04-07 18:00:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh man
2014-04-07 18:00:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that might make for a bad combo
2014-04-07 18:00:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-07 18:01:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're telling me
2014-04-07 18:01:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm giving TG this Friday
2014-04-07 18:01:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my mom sent me a bunch of pictures from grade school if me with my tuba
2014-04-07 18:02:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awww
2014-04-07 18:05:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do kids use small tubas?
2014-04-07 18:05:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahahahah
2014-04-07 18:05:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In 6th grade they're a little bit smaller
2014-04-07 18:05:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty cheesy, huh?
2014-04-07 18:05:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what a band geek
2014-04-07 18:06:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha awesome
2014-04-07 18:06:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how old are you in these?
2014-04-07 18:06:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]11th and 12th grade.
2014-04-07 18:06:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-04-07 18:06:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I can show you the junior high ones
2014-04-07 18:07:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha understandable
2014-04-07 18:07:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least I didn't peak early, that's all I can say
2014-04-07 18:07:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-07 18:08:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can still tell you're pretty through the sheer geekiness in these pics
2014-04-07 18:08:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad I've gone to the other end of the spectrum now
2014-04-07 18:08:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from captain cheerleader to tuba player
2014-04-07 18:09:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I guess I'm glad too
2014-04-07 19:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Last paper from my undergrad was just accepted, haha.
2014-04-07 19:14:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woohoo! Gotta update that CV 
2014-04-07 19:14:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah it'll definitely help me land that engineering job someday!
2014-04-07 19:18:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Science, it's all the same. Right?
2014-04-07 19:18:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely
2014-04-07 19:18:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-07 19:18:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least that's what I'll tell myself
2014-04-07 19:21:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My research for the last 2 years probably won't result in a publication until I'm almost done with grad school, too
2014-04-07 19:22:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah? Why's that? Just a long project?
2014-04-07 19:23:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The post-doc in charge of the project is pretty incapable. And it takes a lot for me to say that
2014-04-07 19:24:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah, bummer.
2014-04-07 19:31:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gonna grab some pho with Dar!
2014-04-07 19:31:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't seen him in way too long considering how close we live to each other.
2014-04-07 19:32:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nomz, I love pho. 
2014-04-07 19:32:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually just had it for the first time a couple weeks ago
2014-04-07 19:32:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it is good
2014-04-07 19:33:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are y'all gonna watch the game after?
2014-04-07 19:34:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he said there were TVs at the place
2014-04-07 19:35:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess there's gonna be some live music at this place too
2014-04-07 19:37:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm almost done with this database project, so I think I deserve a break
2014-04-07 19:39:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like a good time. 
2014-04-07 19:40:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Random, but me and your friend Dar have a mutual friend on Facebook! A friend of mine in Miami I partied with 
2014-04-07 19:40:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not surprised
2014-04-07 19:40:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this dude could probably keep up with you
2014-04-07 19:40:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he volunteered at Bonnaroo for like six years straight
2014-04-07 19:40:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he was my roommate my senior year and is my MDMA hookup
2014-04-07 19:43:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm a little worried about your interpretation of me and my drug use lol. But yeah it figures he would know Greg, he was everyone's everything hook up in Miami and went to a ton of festivals  
2014-04-07 19:44:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you think my interpretation is?
2014-04-07 19:44:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just using the data I've got!
2014-04-07 19:44:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-07 19:52:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True. Have fun at dinner
2014-04-07 20:16:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dar is playing some Thriftworks in the car and holy shit did not realize how much I wanted to go to an EDM show.
2014-04-07 20:25:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That block was sick.
2014-04-07 20:25:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't even heard of thriftworks, but sounds dubstepy haha. 
2014-04-07 20:26:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just got to hardy's
2014-04-07 20:26:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Smoked a lil bowl before haha
2014-04-07 21:33:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Thriftworks is more trap I guess.
2014-04-07 21:39:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That would've been my second guess 
2014-04-07 21:42:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you listen to a track or something?
2014-04-07 21:43:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, but just the name doesn't strike me as any other subgenre of edm 
2014-04-07 21:44:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. I guess I've never noticed naming trends.
2014-04-07 21:46:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're gonna see Godzilla when you're here, btw
2014-04-07 22:27:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like me and you? Or is this a group thing?
2014-04-07 22:29:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We saw a preview and decided we needed to get a group together may 16 when it came out, and I realized you'd be here for that
2014-04-07 22:29:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. Sounds like a good time.
2014-04-07 22:29:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean obviously if you don't want to we don't have to lol
2014-04-07 22:31:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Looks like we were wrong together 😘
2014-04-07 22:37:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should've bet something anyways, then we could've both won something off the other ;)
2014-04-07 22:39:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I don't know if I want to risk it now!
2014-04-07 22:40:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was your pho?
2014-04-07 22:44:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nom. The live music is a DJ set. It's kinda goofy, you would never expect this place to be hosting this kind of event. And there's not really anyone here. We might check out some reggae in a bit though.
2014-04-07 22:47:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Reggae shows are super fun
2014-04-07 22:49:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you want to chat a little and its not too late when you get home, lemme know :)
2014-04-08 01:38:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oops I never responded. I had "OK will do" sitting in the text field.
2014-04-08 01:38:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Anyway, I'm guessing you're asleep...
2014-04-08 01:38:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe not?
2014-04-08 01:38:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not quite
2014-04-08 01:38:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was playing some pvz2
2014-04-08 01:39:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha so on your way out?
2014-04-08 01:39:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can hang in there for a few if it means I get to see you
2014-04-08 01:40:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw OK :)
2014-04-08 01:40:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you home?
2014-04-08 01:40:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah
2014-04-08 01:41:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well do you want to video?
2014-04-08 01:41:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah!
2014-04-08 02:12:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's trying to get me to come back!
2014-04-08 02:12:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-04-08 02:13:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's Steve Jobs!
2014-04-08 02:14:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna get sappy for a second because it's something I was thinking about earlier, but I'm fucking grateful as hell for whatever this is, no matter how it ends up.
2014-04-08 02:16:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You make me smile so much
2014-04-08 02:17:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good :)
2014-04-08 02:17:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like I've forgotten how much I was capable of smiling
2014-04-08 02:17:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*I'd
2014-04-08 16:51:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pub night before ethics  👍👍
2014-04-08 16:52:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha sweet. Y'all are doing it right.
2014-04-08 16:56:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I tried registering for classes today and was blocked from each class for various reasons. The course enrollment/advising/adminstration here is one giant frustrating clusterfuck
2014-04-08 17:09:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's so obnoxious. Probably not helping your exasperation with school
2014-04-08 17:26:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah. It's such an unnecessary source of stress too. It definitely does not have to be this complicated.
2014-04-08 20:02:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A lady in class said "If it was meant to survive, it wouldn't be so ugly" when discussing conservation 
2014-04-08 20:02:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-08 20:02:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a pretty good line
2014-04-08 20:03:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]honestly kinda true
2014-04-08 20:03:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least from the way the universe has been playing out so far
2014-04-08 20:03:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Ugly" is only based on human perception. 
2014-04-08 20:04:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but humans are the ones determining which species survive
2014-04-08 20:04:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at this point in time
2014-04-08 20:04:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or are worth conserving I should sa
2014-04-08 20:04:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]y
2014-04-08 20:04:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not in the entire universe
2014-04-08 20:05:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]isn't the focus on Earth species?
2014-04-08 20:05:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You said universe
2014-04-08 20:06:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I was just saying that's the way the universe is playing out
2014-04-08 20:06:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on Earth
2014-04-08 20:06:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And yeah, a lot of money is funneled to charismatic mammals, but that doesn't mean us as young scientists should keep it that way 
2014-04-08 20:06:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whose side do you think I'm on here?
2014-04-08 20:07:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know! You're worrying me!
2014-04-08 20:07:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't saying only cute animals should be cared for
2014-04-08 20:08:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm saying that is the way the universe is working right now
2014-04-08 20:08:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because most humans don't care about ugly animals
2014-04-08 20:08:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just saying her observation was kinda accurate
2014-04-08 20:08:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you take the emotion out of it
2014-04-08 20:08:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It wasn't an observation, she meant it
2014-04-08 20:08:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I knoooowwww
2014-04-08 20:09:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I regret my tangent
2014-04-08 20:09:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I regret jumping on you about it
2014-04-08 20:09:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm tired and cranky
2014-04-08 20:09:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And fearing for the future of humanity 
2014-04-08 20:10:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that ethics class will definitely NOT restore your faith in humanity
2014-04-08 20:10:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the animal rights talks blow my fucking mind
2014-04-08 20:10:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's like
2014-04-08 20:10:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just admit this shit is evil
2014-04-08 20:10:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that you're okay with it
2014-04-08 20:10:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]quit trying to dance around it making it sound okay
2014-04-08 20:10:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sorry if that was an extreme point of view
2014-04-08 20:10:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's how I feel 
2014-04-08 20:10:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-08 20:11:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]People justify eating me in very similar ways. Or by pure ignorance. 
2014-04-08 20:11:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha meat
2014-04-08 20:11:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-04-08 20:11:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahahaha
2014-04-08 20:11:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yeah
2014-04-08 20:11:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I agree
2014-04-08 20:11:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I totally admit it's fucked up that I eat meat
2014-04-08 20:12:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I just deal with it
2014-04-08 20:12:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I mean it'd be fucked up if there were any kind of moral truths
2014-04-08 20:12:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh
2014-04-08 20:12:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-08 20:12:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry
2014-04-08 20:14:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does my amorality bug you?
2014-04-08 20:14:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think you're amoral
2014-04-08 20:14:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I know I'm amoral
2014-04-08 20:14:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I behave "morally" by most societal standards
2014-04-08 20:15:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you have a personal "code" that you live by, right?
2014-04-08 20:15:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not really
2014-04-08 20:16:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't believe in free will
2014-04-08 20:16:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sooo
2014-04-08 20:16:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]make decisions based on a code doesn't really make sense to me
2014-04-08 20:16:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know I respond to certain situations a certain way
2014-04-08 20:16:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but there's nothing absolute about it
2014-04-08 20:17:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I might respond differently one day because changes in my brain shifted my code
2014-04-08 20:19:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't feel like texting about this now, sorry. Let's table it for another time?
2014-04-08 20:20:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-04-08 20:20:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sorry to be a bummer
2014-04-08 20:20:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not a bummer, I'm just tired 
2014-04-08 20:53:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you listened to any Antony and the Johnsons?
2014-04-08 20:53:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, I haven't heard of them
2014-04-08 20:54:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just listened to I Am a Bird Now
2014-04-08 20:54:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was what Tom recommended to me when I asked him for an important album
2014-04-08 20:54:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's pretty good
2014-04-08 20:54:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are some tracks that really blew me away
2014-04-08 20:54:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What kind of music?
2014-04-08 20:54:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kslkgAX3uAg
2014-04-08 20:55:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]piano stuff with a focus on the voice
2014-04-08 20:55:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]use headphones!
2014-04-08 20:55:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I left my nice headphones at school!
2014-04-08 20:55:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just listen to it later
2014-04-08 20:55:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-08 20:56:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll try to rustle some up. I do like ze piano
2014-04-08 20:57:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I'm just messing around, kind of
2014-04-08 20:57:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think laptop speakers kinda ruin music sometimes
2014-04-08 20:57:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I only have my phone, which is even worse
2014-04-08 20:57:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes that is worse
2014-04-08 20:57:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-08 20:58:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I fully ascribe to the importance of good headphones
2014-04-08 20:58:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or good speakers
2014-04-08 20:58:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep
2014-04-08 20:58:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm actually headphones > good speakers these days
2014-04-08 20:58:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I'm really trying to appreciate an album it's gotta be with headphones
2014-04-08 20:59:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]although the best way to get low-end stuff is with a nice sub
2014-04-08 21:00:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-04-08 21:01:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying to find a movie to watch
2014-04-08 21:02:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]narrowed it down any?
2014-04-08 21:02:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-04-08 21:03:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm thinking either something silly, something sad, or something scary
2014-04-08 21:03:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, yeah that doesn't really narrow it down does it?
2014-04-08 21:04:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They all start with "s" though, that's something
2014-04-08 21:04:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah I suppose that's true
2014-04-08 21:04:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should let me know what you pick
2014-04-08 21:10:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry I'm not always 'in the mood' to have deep meaningful conversations. It's not that I don't care or dislike what you have to say, or don't want to eventually have that conversation with you
2014-04-08 21:10:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude, no need to apologize
2014-04-08 21:10:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that totally makes sense
2014-04-08 21:11:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and messaging definitely isn't the forum for talking about that kind of stuff anyway
2014-04-08 21:11:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was mostly worried I was freaking you out
2014-04-08 21:11:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know my views on that stuff are kind of unorthodox
2014-04-08 21:12:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or at least uncomfortable for a lot of people
2014-04-08 21:12:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you also just went from saying something was evil to saying you're amoral
2014-04-08 21:12:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-04-08 21:13:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I "feel" like they're immoral
2014-04-08 21:13:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or evil
2014-04-08 21:13:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I realize they aren't
2014-04-08 21:13:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because that doesn't exist
2014-04-08 21:13:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ehh we should avoid this right now, huh?
2014-04-08 21:13:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah. You didn't freak me out though
2014-04-08 21:14:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, good.
2014-04-08 21:17:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Look up the synopsis of the movie "Woman on Top"
2014-04-08 21:19:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm watching the trailer
2014-04-08 21:20:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that what you're thinking about watching?
2014-04-08 21:20:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, I just saw the blurb on HBO Go and it cracked me up
2014-04-08 21:21:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, the trailer looked tacky as eff
2014-04-08 21:27:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]James and the Giant Peach I think
2014-04-08 21:27:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from the director of Coraline
2014-04-08 21:28:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was actually thinking about watching Coraline again now that I've read the book
2014-04-08 21:28:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it used to be on Netflix
2014-04-08 21:28:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure if it still is
2014-04-08 21:29:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll put on James and the Giant Peach too, though    😃 
2014-04-08 21:30:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd like that
2014-04-08 21:34:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't remember the subpar kid singing
2014-04-08 21:35:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah
2014-04-08 21:35:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're a bit ahead of me
2014-04-08 21:35:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I remember that
2014-04-08 21:35:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll pause while I go make a snack haha
2014-04-08 21:35:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-04-08 21:43:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm having so many idd emotional responses to random images in this movie. Like held over responses from the hundreds of times I watched it as a kid
2014-04-08 21:44:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah I get that with some movies too
2014-04-08 21:44:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I only saw this one a few times as a kid, though
2014-04-08 21:44:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was idd id, or is that an abbreviation?
2014-04-08 21:44:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*odd
2014-04-08 21:44:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*disjunct
2014-04-08 21:48:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like it would be really cool to work on a movie like this because you'd get to interact with so many different creative types
2014-04-08 21:49:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would be cool for a day or two, but there would also be quite a lot of personality haha
2014-04-08 21:50:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think there's big egos in the non-glamourous jobs?
2014-04-08 21:50:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like the stop-motion animators
2014-04-08 21:50:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]set designers
2014-04-08 21:50:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]etc.
2014-04-08 21:50:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't say egos, but personalities 
2014-04-08 21:50:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah I guess you're right
2014-04-08 21:51:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm gonna make a stop motion movie someday
2014-04-08 21:51:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-08 21:51:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it seems really appealing to me for some reason
2014-04-08 21:51:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes!
2014-04-08 21:51:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would take like a whole day for 2 minutes, but I think it's be super fun 
2014-04-08 21:51:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-04-08 21:51:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you watch Parks and Rec?
2014-04-08 21:52:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not regularly, but Yes
2014-04-08 21:52:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like it
2014-04-08 21:52:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ben is unemployed for a bit and starts working on a stop motion movie
2014-04-08 21:52:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he plays back the footage
2014-04-08 21:53:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and is pretty bummed about how short it actually is
2014-04-08 21:53:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]after he worked on it for so long
2014-04-08 21:54:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could see that 
2014-04-08 21:54:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just think I'd enjoy the process
2014-04-08 21:54:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like it'd be kind of meditative
2014-04-08 21:54:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you remember gumbi?
2014-04-08 21:54:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it's so meticulous and kind of tedious
2014-04-08 21:54:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know Gumbi
2014-04-08 21:54:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I never really watch it much, though
2014-04-08 21:55:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't seen it in over a decade I'm sure
2014-04-08 21:58:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's how I feel about puzzling sometimes. Relaxing 
2014-04-08 21:59:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I haven't sat down to do a puzzle in a while
2014-04-08 22:16:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you give me a back massage next I see you?
2014-04-08 22:16:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]of course
2014-04-08 22:16:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Such a nice guy
2014-04-08 22:16:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-04-08 22:16:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]any reason to get my hands on ya    😉 
2014-04-08 22:17:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I never noticed how Monty Python-esque that animated sequence was
2014-04-08 22:17:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]James' dream
2014-04-08 22:17:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very silly
2014-04-08 22:21:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Jack Skellington!
2014-04-08 22:23:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a great movie
2014-04-08 22:24:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I should see Coraline
2014-04-08 22:24:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you would like it
2014-04-08 22:24:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and there really wasn't any needle eye stuff in the book
2014-04-08 22:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they made the threat
2014-04-08 22:25:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but there was never any actual moment where it seemed like it would happen
2014-04-08 22:25:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The fake mom had button eyes
2014-04-08 22:25:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-04-08 22:25:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what freaked you out?
2014-04-08 22:26:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Imagination can be much worse 
2014-04-08 22:26:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Than what's actually written
2014-04-08 22:26:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's true
2014-04-08 22:26:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Coraline is just really awesome visually
2014-04-08 22:26:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I think they do a really good job with the creepiness
2014-04-08 22:32:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Danny Elfman was the singing voice of Jack and another guy was the speaking voice
2014-04-08 22:32:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How interesting 
2014-04-08 22:32:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I didn't realize he sang
2014-04-08 22:32:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me neither 
2014-04-08 22:34:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're on the Empire State Building, James!
2014-04-08 22:34:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*tears*
2014-04-08 22:34:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-08 22:35:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wonder if this movie helped form peoples associations with "sad" music and "happy" music
2014-04-08 22:35:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That scene before with the cricket 
2014-04-08 22:36:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-04-08 22:37:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He plays a sad tune and a happy one. I don't think it actually did, but it's interesting to think about
2014-04-08 22:37:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you mean the grasshopper?
2014-04-08 22:37:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-04-08 22:38:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would be interesting to see how a naive person responds to what we consider "sad" and "happy" music
2014-04-08 22:38:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm assuming that's been studied at some point
2014-04-08 22:38:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure
2014-04-09 00:06:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dropped off my computer today. They said it should hopefully be fixed by the end of the week
2014-04-09 00:07:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well that seems like progress.
2014-04-09 00:07:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like they're actually going to fix it.
2014-04-09 00:08:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah, I just hope it's not too much $$
2014-04-09 00:08:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They didn't give you an estimate?
2014-04-09 00:08:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know how that Apple stuff works.
2014-04-09 00:09:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just dropped it off at the hardware center on campus. They're Mac certified
2014-04-09 00:09:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh okay. Yeah hopefully it's not expensive.
2014-04-09 00:10:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you been coding all night?
2014-04-09 00:11:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I stopped about halfway through James and the Giant Peach.
2014-04-09 00:12:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Only two weeks now!
2014-04-09 00:13:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've been waiting to say the same thing :)
2014-04-09 00:14:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha aw
2014-04-09 00:14:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's only been a month since Haley's party. Isn't that crazy?
2014-04-09 00:15:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I don't know? I guess that seems short to you?
2014-04-09 00:16:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not necessarily 
2014-04-09 00:16:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it feels like it's been longer than that
2014-04-09 00:17:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Does seem like a lot has happened between us in that amount of time.
2014-04-09 00:18:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which is kinda funny since we aren't physically in each other's presence much.
2014-04-09 00:19:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. This is definitely unlike anything I've been a part of before.
2014-04-09 00:21:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it's silly to compare it to 'typical' relationship rate conventions then
2014-04-09 00:24:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. That's exactly the word I was thinking (except in the form of unconventional). It's all a little strange when you look at it from afar, but it doesn't feel weird to me. Feels really good actually.
2014-04-09 00:26:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It don't feel bad, that's fer shur
2014-04-09 00:26:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha sorry I'm getting a lil sleepy
2014-04-09 00:27:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha no worries. That was pretty goofy, though.
2014-04-09 00:28:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's what I would've probably said, had we been having this conversation in person 
2014-04-09 00:28:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cuddling, obviously 
2014-04-09 00:28:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Obviously!
2014-04-09 00:29:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I find your goofiness really attractive.
2014-04-09 00:29:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It totally accents your physical sexiness.
2014-04-09 00:31:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can be sexy in non-physical ways too...
2014-04-09 00:31:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just not usually right before or after sleeping 
2014-04-09 00:32:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I get what you're saying.
2014-04-09 00:32:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not always goofy 
2014-04-09 00:33:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'd like to think you're attracted to me for more than just my good looks haha 
2014-04-09 00:34:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought that's what I was implying with the goofiness comment, but I guess I failed 😣
2014-04-09 00:35:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I was mostly teasing you, I got what you meant
2014-04-09 00:36:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think a long distance thing based on purely physical attraction would be a pretty bad idea haha
2014-04-09 00:39:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-04-09 00:39:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can go to this while I'm there!   http://www.klydewarrenpark.org:80/Things-To-Do/events/decks-in-the-park.html
2014-04-09 00:40:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yep! Dar actually mentioned it to me. I went once last summer.
2014-04-09 00:40:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like free and I like picnics
2014-04-09 00:43:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're going to houston today!
2014-04-09 00:43:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I am!
2014-04-09 00:43:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Super excited.
2014-04-09 00:45:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My friend Michael Schneider whom I call the Schnyfather said it's an awesome show.
2014-04-09 00:47:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you have GA or a seat?
2014-04-09 00:51:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A seat. I splurged.
2014-04-09 00:51:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've been waiting like 7 years for this, though!
2014-04-09 00:51:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Worth it
2014-04-09 00:52:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure you'll make friends with the people next to you 
2014-04-09 00:52:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should stop by and say hi to my momma 
2014-04-09 00:52:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah?
2014-04-09 00:53:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She would probably love it. 
2014-04-09 00:53:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And would feed you
2014-04-09 00:53:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Buttttt I'd rather be there the 1st time haha
2014-04-09 00:53:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK. I would've totally done it.
2014-04-09 00:55:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]First impression might be better with less of a badass look going too
2014-04-09 00:55:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh, maybe.
2014-04-09 00:55:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure she'll think you're cute either way. Which is creepy to say...
2014-04-09 00:56:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-04-09 00:57:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think this might be the last time I see her for a long time :/
2014-04-09 00:57:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least until September 
2014-04-09 00:58:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Damn really?
2014-04-09 00:58:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't have any other reason to go home. And if I go home in sept it'd probably be to visit someone else in Tejas
2014-04-09 00:59:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP];)
2014-04-09 00:59:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's a pretty long time though.
2014-04-09 01:00:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure what the longest I've gone without seeing my momma is.
2014-04-09 01:00:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think mine is 4 months
2014-04-09 01:00:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I'd imagine mine is somewhere  around that.
2014-04-09 01:01:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok dude, I gotta go to bed. A ton of shit to do tomorrow. I shoulda videoed you, I'm guessing you're just hanging out in bed too? Haha
2014-04-09 01:02:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah.
2014-04-09 01:02:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight 
2014-04-09 01:03:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet dreams.
2014-04-09 01:03:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Call me on your drive if you're about to crash (literally and in terms of sleepiness)
2014-04-09 01:04:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks. Will do.
2014-04-09 01:09:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just kicked a pile off clothes pretty hard off my bed and realized it was actually the cat
2014-04-09 01:10:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ohh man. I feel bad about how hard I laughed at that.
2014-04-09 01:10:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And just before I was lamenting about how she wasn't snuggling with me
2014-04-09 01:10:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm assuming she's okay?
2014-04-09 01:11:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I'm sure she's not gonna feel particularly motivated now.
2014-04-09 01:11:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah, she just stalked off 
2014-04-09 01:11:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok nowww I'm asleep 
2014-04-09 01:11:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]zZZzZZzzZzz
2014-04-09 01:12:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol goodnight 😘
2014-04-09 10:24:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm gonna go to Evolution in Raleigh June 20-24.
2014-04-09 10:25:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yesss. I'll have a couch for you to crash on if you want ;)
2014-04-09 10:25:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can take the couch, I want a bed. 
2014-04-09 10:26:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you go to any of the conference stuff in Austin? Like any talks?
2014-04-09 10:33:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha told you she'd want to feed you 
2014-04-09 10:48:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. All I made it to all my Darwinian friends' talks.
2014-04-09 10:49:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Except Aaron's because I didn't think I'd be able to sneak in. I felt bad about that.
2014-04-09 10:49:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you didn't pay?
2014-04-09 10:51:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No.
2014-04-09 10:53:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet. Also my mom now wants you sleep at the house for a bit before driving back to Dallas 
2014-04-09 11:08:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha. That's really sweet of her!
2014-04-09 11:08:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd honestly be down with stopping by afterwards, but it'd probably be a little.
2014-04-09 11:09:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And you wouldn't be there like we were talking about last night.
2014-04-09 11:10:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well this would be for you to take a nap if needed and get some food, not necessarily to meet my parents. 
2014-04-09 11:11:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I would be meeting your parents as a byproduct haha.
2014-04-09 11:12:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well yeah, but I don't want my momma to stay up late just to chat with you for a few minutes, though she probably wouldn't mind that either
2014-04-09 11:13:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah it's no worries! My message earlier was supposed to say "it'd probably be a little late"
2014-04-09 11:14:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Tell her I really appreciate the offer, but that I think I'll just had straight back to Dallas and that I'm looking forward to meeting her.
2014-04-09 11:14:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want you to crash and die
2014-04-09 11:15:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha so which way are you pushing me here? I can't tell.
2014-04-09 11:16:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you should go after and eat some food and sleep until like 5a or w/e and then drive back 
2014-04-09 11:17:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm assuming you were gonna skip your 8am anyways? Haha
2014-04-09 11:17:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You know it.
2014-04-09 11:17:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She makes good bacon
2014-04-09 11:18:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I could definitely get down with that.
2014-04-09 11:18:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well let me call and confirm she isn't planning on showing you all my awkward pictures 
2014-04-09 11:19:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha, don't ruin our fun!
2014-04-09 11:20:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll be in a suit. So I'll have that going for me.
2014-04-09 11:24:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I saw that the concert said formal dress! How funny 
2014-04-09 11:25:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's totally down, you'll probably be in my bed since Daniels shower is broken. My room is now the storage place for broken TVs and random shit I haven't thrown away from my childhood so judge it accordingly
2014-04-09 11:26:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can you verify your mom's not an axe murderer for me?
2014-04-09 11:28:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha well the attic drips blood and is banned from anyone but her going up there, but I think her knees keep her downstairs for the most part
2014-04-09 11:35:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-04-09 11:38:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Call me sometime when you're free/on the road. I'll also send you address and stuff
2014-04-09 13:27:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jan Silliman: 7135820544 1019 Sherfield Ridge Katy, TX 77450
2014-04-09 13:28:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Watch out for cops, they always fiendin to give out tickets
2014-04-09 13:28:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]thanks for the heads up
2014-04-09 13:28:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Mrs. Silliman or Jan?
2014-04-09 13:28:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wait that's my number! Hers is 2816827599
2014-04-09 13:29:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Call her ms. Silliman and she might say "just call me jan"
2014-04-09 13:29:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But probably not
2014-04-09 13:29:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-04-09 13:30:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you probably won't see my dad except asleep on a chair, so don't be weirded out if he just waves at you
2014-04-09 13:31:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol no worries
2014-04-09 13:32:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably shouldn't bring a girl back, right?
2014-04-09 13:33:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you do, use Daniel's bed please. Have some propriety
2014-04-09 13:33:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-09 16:42:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm a little more concerned now that I've seen the suit pic. The ladies are gonna swarm you
2014-04-09 19:45:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My eyes are only for you, sugar ;)
2014-04-09 19:46:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like sugar :)
2014-04-09 19:47:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool :)
2014-04-09 19:47:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you there?
2014-04-09 19:48:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah just got here.
2014-04-09 19:49:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pretty swanky area, huh?
2014-04-09 19:49:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, everyone else in Htown kinda hates the woodlands
2014-04-09 19:49:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or generally dislikes it
2014-04-09 19:50:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Uppity rich people?
2014-04-09 19:50:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty much
2014-04-09 19:50:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And once I got lost there trying to find a chickfila, so I have a personal vendeta
2014-04-09 19:54:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Enjoy the show, wish I was there with you!
2014-04-09 19:54:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Take some videos!
2014-04-09 19:54:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No!
2014-04-09 19:55:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha wish you were here with me too, though. I'm so excited!
2014-04-09 19:55:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is everyone else dressed up?
2014-04-09 19:56:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah. Maybe 30%?
2014-04-09 19:56:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Enough that it's pretty cool, though.
2014-04-09 20:32:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This DJ (Kid Koala) is playing right now and he just put on "The Whole World" by Outkast. I haven't heard this track in forever!
2014-04-09 21:05:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gotta love Outkast 
2014-04-09 21:06:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I went to BSD pub night and no Darwinians showed up, so I had to make some new friends 
2014-04-09 22:35:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Kicking it with Win Butler
2014-04-09 22:36:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was within arms reach at one point.
2014-04-09 22:39:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ahhhhhh!
2014-04-09 22:39:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd you have a seat so close?
2014-04-09 22:45:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The band walked through the crowd and came right by me.
2014-04-09 22:48:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]On the way to your parents! :)
2014-04-09 22:53:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:) so weird and silly and awesone
2014-04-09 23:03:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Call her when you're like 10 min away
2014-04-09 23:53:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm here. Met your mama. Getting changed in your room now :)
2014-04-09 23:55:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha restrain yourself from digging through my old stuff, though I'd probably do the same in your position 
2014-04-09 23:57:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wanna chat for a minute from my bed and really trip me out?
2014-04-10 00:05:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm being fed right now :)
2014-04-10 00:06:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:))))
2014-04-10 00:12:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK I can video now.
2014-04-10 06:20:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you want a waffle with your eggs and bacon, or toast?
2014-04-10 06:21:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It doesn't matter
2014-04-10 06:38:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)))))?)
2014-04-10 06:38:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss my puppy 
2014-04-10 06:46:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Om nom nom
2014-04-10 08:57:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yay!
2014-04-10 11:35:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just dropped off the car.
2014-04-10 11:57:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Your mom totally did the axe gag by the way. I just didn't notice it in my post-concert daze.
2014-04-10 11:57:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet. My mom says you were very cute, polite, and washed your dish 
2014-04-10 11:58:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All important things in her book
2014-04-10 11:59:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha glad to hear it. Well she was very sweet, welcoming, and fun to talk to, which are all important things in my book ;)
2014-04-10 12:04:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Y'all have a pretty nice place too
2014-04-10 12:05:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks, Texas is at least good for cheap property
2014-04-10 12:18:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're trying to sell it because it's way too big for the two of them but they keep making up excuses about every house they look at
2014-04-10 12:19:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well you don't want to get stuck in a place that you don't like! She did mention they were looking to sell the place, though.
2014-04-10 12:51:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hey consolation prize
2014-04-10 12:52:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because the UTD admin are being such assholes about letting me take the classes they tell me I "need" to take, I get to take the Bioinformatics
2014-04-10 12:52:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]class
2014-04-10 13:14:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty cool! Did you work out the other classes?
2014-04-10 13:15:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm in two of the "cores" I would need for the Intelligent Systems track
2014-04-10 13:15:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I think I'm just gonna switch to that one
2014-04-10 13:15:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and hopefully get enrolled in a fourth class if my grades are decent
2014-04-10 13:15:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then I'd just need to take four more in the Spring to graduate
2014-04-10 13:15:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and only 1 core
2014-04-10 13:16:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it'd hopefully pretty easy to fill up the other three
2014-04-10 13:16:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's the difference between the two tracks? Like in the kind if job you would get?
2014-04-10 13:16:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably nothing
2014-04-10 13:17:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]machine learning, natural language processing, and statistics are probably the most important categories for doing big data stuff
2014-04-10 13:17:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'll have all of those
2014-04-10 13:17:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the only class I'll be missing is the "intro to big data" course
2014-04-10 13:17:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I'm guessing is an overview based on the title
2014-04-10 13:17:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and wouldn't really teach me much
2014-04-10 14:01:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It does seem kinda silly to take an intro course when you've already been learning stuff about it
2014-04-10 14:02:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The department is really poorly organized. Which is too bad because they have a decent research program.
2014-04-10 14:03:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How's your day going? Did you have your meeting yet?
2014-04-10 14:05:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup, Ev Processes went a little over my head with the theory but it was good. And Cathy and I caught up/made some game plans. 
2014-04-10 14:06:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now I'm working on my stupid ethics presentation 
2014-04-10 14:06:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha. You're giving that when?
2014-04-10 14:07:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The 22 but we have a group meeting tn
2014-04-10 14:07:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. What was your topic again?
2014-04-10 14:07:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Genetic engineering
2014-04-10 14:08:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. That could be interesting. People seem to get riled up about that stuff.
2014-04-10 14:09:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I'm actually learning a lot about it I didn't know
2014-04-10 14:11:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I sent you an email that's pretty funny
2014-04-10 14:13:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I replied. That's pretty great.
2014-04-10 14:17:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My first TG was about music too :)
2014-04-10 14:26:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]D'aww. Did you okay your guitar?
2014-04-10 14:26:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*play
2014-04-10 14:28:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha no it was much more antagonistic than that. The title was something like "Why My Music Tastes are Better than Yours"
2014-04-10 14:29:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]of course
2014-04-10 14:31:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha hey! What's that supposed to mean?
2014-04-10 14:32:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It actually went over really well. Got a lot of good banter going. That's where I got my reputation as a "Radiohead hater"
2014-04-10 14:33:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I gave another TG where we did origami.
2014-04-10 14:35:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It just sounded a little cocky ;)
2014-04-10 14:35:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i wish I knew how to do origami
2014-04-10 14:36:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think this TG will be that great
2014-04-10 14:37:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I might do a duet with myself playing the GoT theme song...
2014-04-10 14:53:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you go to class?
2014-04-10 16:55:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah I ran into a friend and we ended up grabbing lunch.
2014-04-10 19:45:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So it turns out that not only did my partner for Computer Architecture not drop the class, but he's this precocious little freshman who has already done a significant chunk of the project
2014-04-10 20:07:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I think my shades made my face break out.
2014-04-10 20:07:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I look like a teenager.
2014-04-10 21:02:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got done with EvMorph
2014-04-10 21:02:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty tight about the partner. As for a teenager, I highly doubt that
2014-04-10 21:04:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was the EvMorph?
2014-04-10 21:07:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty good, about Holocene coral reef trends. He ended it with a pretty strange comment about how we should get people to care about coral reefs via terrorism though 
2014-04-10 21:07:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol what?
2014-04-10 21:09:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Next time we talk I'll explain it, it was a little convoluted 
2014-04-10 21:10:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-04-10 21:11:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna go home and try to record some tuba
2014-04-10 21:11:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha awesome. You should send me some of the raw cuts!
2014-04-10 21:13:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll be lucky if you get the good cuts haha
2014-04-10 21:14:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awww come on, I wanna hear    😞 
2014-04-10 21:15:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't played in over a month, it's gonna be rough
2014-04-10 21:16:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My lips gonna be swollen tomorrow 
2014-04-10 21:19:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha really? I never really thought about that.
2014-04-10 21:20:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah, practicing is definitely essential to building up endurance 
2014-04-10 21:20:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess getting lip callouses too?
2014-04-10 21:21:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do the lips even adapt to that?
2014-04-10 21:21:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do they always get swollen after playing?
2014-04-10 21:24:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah you don't really get lip calluses. It's more muscular development and I think something with constricted blood vessels
2014-04-10 21:25:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like when you over-exercise or work out other muscles they can get swollen and tender
2014-04-10 21:25:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah I see
2014-04-10 21:25:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-04-10 21:25:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't press on the mouthpiece
2014-04-10 21:26:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the lips do adapt in some way, though?
2014-04-10 21:27:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They strengthen like any other muscle 
2014-04-10 21:27:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so they get bigger?
2014-04-10 21:27:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not perceptibly
2014-04-10 21:28:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But they will be swollen tm at least
2014-04-10 21:29:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word, that's pretty funny
2014-04-10 21:29:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you got that circular breathing down?
2014-04-10 21:32:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh not really
2014-04-10 21:32:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could kinda do it on long sustained notes at a certain volume, but usually just staggered breathed with the person next to you
2014-04-10 21:33:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, that technique is kinda bonkers to me
2014-04-10 22:04:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like practicing after 10pm is just rude
2014-04-10 22:05:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I guess I'm done until tm lol
2014-04-10 22:05:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah maybe a little
2014-04-10 22:13:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I corrupted my hard drive a while back accidentally
2014-04-10 22:13:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I had to try to recover all my files on it
2014-04-10 22:14:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it appears I lost my TG talk    😞 
2014-04-10 22:14:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wanted to send you it
2014-04-10 22:14:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh no! Both of them?
2014-04-10 22:14:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the second one I just brought in paper and played YouTube videos
2014-04-10 22:15:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yeah the music one
2014-04-10 22:15:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a bummer
2014-04-10 22:15:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had made these charts
2014-04-10 22:15:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where one axis was a measure of artistry or something like that
2014-04-10 22:15:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the other axis was entertainment
2014-04-10 22:16:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I did different genres and stuff
2014-04-10 22:16:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was fun
2014-04-10 22:16:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Personal opinions about artistry and entertainment?
2014-04-10 22:16:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-04-10 22:17:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would be interesting so see if those had changed over the years
2014-04-10 22:17:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would
2014-04-10 22:17:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man that bums me out!
2014-04-10 22:17:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:/ you can always make new ones haha
2014-04-10 22:17:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I suppose so.
2014-04-10 22:17:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wouldn't be the same, though.
2014-04-10 22:18:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]RIP 23 year old Michael's inflammatory TG
2014-04-10 22:21:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think 23 year old Michael and 23 year old Katie would get along so well? Barring obvious external complications  
2014-04-10 22:21:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a good question!
2014-04-10 22:22:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'd still have been into you.
2014-04-10 22:23:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the question is more of whether you would have been into me.
2014-04-10 22:23:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you changed a lot in 3 years?
2014-04-10 22:24:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know.
2014-04-10 22:24:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm fundamentally the same person, but I think my outlook on life has changed a lot the past several months.
2014-04-10 22:24:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm finally turning into the guy I've always wanted to be.
2014-04-10 22:25:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a pretty good feeling
2014-04-10 22:25:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it took me going through some shitty situations to solidify some things.
2014-04-10 22:26:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's usually how it works
2014-04-10 22:27:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah... so even if you would have been into me
2014-04-10 22:27:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it probably would've crashed and burned
2014-04-10 22:27:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess there's still potential for that
2014-04-10 22:27:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the probability is lower, though
2014-04-10 22:28:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If this had happened when I was 20, it would've definitely crashed and burned 
2014-04-10 22:29:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh fuck yeah
2014-04-10 22:29:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if we were both 20?
2014-04-10 22:29:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]holy shit
2014-04-10 22:29:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that would've been something to see
2014-04-10 22:29:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was a bit of mess
2014-04-10 22:29:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fucking 20 year old Michael with the whole world figured out
2014-04-10 22:30:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-04-10 22:30:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how so?
2014-04-10 22:30:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Typical getting over a bad heartbreak bullshit. I died my hair bright red
2014-04-10 22:30:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*dyed
2014-04-10 22:31:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw    😞 
2014-04-10 22:31:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah that's rough
2014-04-10 22:31:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha it's ok 
2014-04-10 22:31:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good learning experience I guess
2014-04-10 22:32:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-04-10 22:32:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what'd you learn?
2014-04-10 22:32:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you don't mind me asking
2014-04-10 22:32:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no worries if it's too personal
2014-04-10 22:35:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mostly came to terms with some things about myself that I had been compartmentalizing, like fear of rejection and a tendency to trust too easily. 
2014-04-10 22:36:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And what I didn't actually want in a relationship after all 
2014-04-10 22:36:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I guess those are good things to realize
2014-04-10 22:37:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]kinda sucks that "trusting too easily" is a naive trait and something that needs corrected
2014-04-10 22:37:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah but I guess that's life lol
2014-04-10 22:38:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unfortunately
2014-04-10 22:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've actually thought about the you being 23 thing a bit
2014-04-10 22:40:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know it's like getting ahead of things and whatever
2014-04-10 22:40:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's just how my brain works
2014-04-10 22:42:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely might be getting ahead of things, but I don't think it'll be an issue  
2014-04-10 22:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I'm not really worried about it
2014-04-10 22:43:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's something I would've worried about in the past
2014-04-10 22:43:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless it weirds you out for done reason 
2014-04-10 22:43:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*some
2014-04-10 22:43:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's one of the big differences about me now
2014-04-10 22:43:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and no it doesn't weird me out
2014-04-10 22:43:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still think about the future a lot
2014-04-10 22:44:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and possibilities and shit
2014-04-10 22:44:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and how things could go bad or good
2014-04-10 22:44:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't worry about it now
2014-04-10 22:44:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why would you have worried about it?
2014-04-10 22:44:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm able to re focus on the present
2014-04-10 22:44:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]worried about us?
2014-04-10 22:45:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or my future?
2014-04-10 22:45:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Worried about my age
2014-04-10 22:45:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh
2014-04-10 22:45:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just knowing how much my worldview shifted in the past few years
2014-04-10 22:45:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]again
2014-04-10 22:46:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]getting way ahead of things
2014-04-10 22:46:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just how I am
2014-04-10 22:46:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-10 22:46:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I guess I'm saying I'm just happy I get to participate in this time in your life!
2014-04-10 22:47:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha kinda corny but I like it
2014-04-10 22:50:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure my worldviews are still going to shift, but that doesn't have to be mutually exclusive to being with you :)
2014-04-10 22:58:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, I can't think of a response that isn't kinda pessimistic sounding
2014-04-10 22:58:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Greatttt
2014-04-10 22:59:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know, it doesn't matter
2014-04-10 22:59:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I said in my corny way either
2014-04-10 22:59:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]earlier*
2014-04-10 23:01:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just happy to share some time with you. You really are an amazing person.
2014-04-10 23:07:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That probably wasn't necessary
2014-04-10 23:07:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or intelligent
2014-04-10 23:07:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on my part
2014-04-10 23:07:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry
2014-04-10 23:07:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No no it's ok!
2014-04-10 23:07:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]eh, I still feel bad about it
2014-04-10 23:07:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just didn't know what to say
2014-04-10 23:08:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it's not really something that's easy to respond to I guess
2014-04-10 23:08:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't worry about it
2014-04-10 23:09:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooook
2014-04-10 23:12:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not always great at taking compliments
2014-04-10 23:13:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, what?
2014-04-10 23:13:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't always know how to respond to compliments 
2014-04-10 23:14:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, are you referring to me saying you're amazing?
2014-04-10 23:14:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]orrr
2014-04-10 23:14:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where is that coming from?
2014-04-10 23:14:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-10 23:14:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I guess
2014-04-10 23:14:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just letting me know?
2014-04-10 23:15:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I didn't really expect a response to that
2014-04-10 23:15:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was more the other stuff
2014-04-10 23:15:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I expect you to take my compliments and feel good
2014-04-10 23:15:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's all I'm going for
2014-04-10 23:15:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-10 23:15:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you don't even have to feel good
2014-04-10 23:16:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as long as you're away it's how I feel about you
2014-04-10 23:16:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aware
2014-04-10 23:16:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha away might work too
2014-04-10 23:16:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-04-10 23:16:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except it's true when you're not away too
2014-04-10 23:17:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maaaaan
2014-04-10 23:17:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I totally bummed myself out
2014-04-10 23:18:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry 
2014-04-10 23:18:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's ok
2014-04-10 23:18:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm just trying to reconcile these two different aspects of my personality
2014-04-10 23:18:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I think sometimes I go to far in either direction
2014-04-10 23:18:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]too*
2014-04-10 23:19:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which 2 aspects?
2014-04-10 23:20:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you don't mind me asking
2014-04-10 23:20:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or we can drop the subject if you want 
2014-04-10 23:20:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah, I don't mind.
2014-04-10 23:21:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess this romantic side and a sort of disenchanted side
2014-04-10 23:22:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'll just try to filter out most of the disenchanted comments unless I feel they're validated 
2014-04-10 23:23:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'd actually really appreciate that
2014-04-10 23:23:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I prefer my romantic side
2014-04-10 23:23:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's more fun
2014-04-10 23:23:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the disenchanted thing is a defense mechanism a bit
2014-04-10 23:23:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Preaching to the choir on defense mechanisms 
2014-04-10 23:24:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, well I'm glad we can empathize with each other in that regard then
2014-04-10 23:31:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You might have a tendency to overthink things, but it's who you are and something I'm learning to appreciate in you. I just don't want you to bum yourself out over this before it even has a chance to really start
2014-04-10 23:35:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, you're completely right
2014-04-10 23:35:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably something I could work on
2014-04-10 23:38:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you like alcoholic milkshakes?
2014-04-10 23:39:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt it
2014-04-10 23:39:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I've ever had one
2014-04-10 23:39:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think we talked about how I think alcohol ruins most tasty drinks
2014-04-10 23:44:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My friend told me about a really good burger place in Dallas with adult milkshakes
2014-04-10 23:44:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't knock em until you try them
2014-04-10 23:45:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm down
2014-04-10 23:45:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's the name of it?
2014-04-10 23:47:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wrote it down hold on
2014-04-10 23:50:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Twisted Root Burger Co
2014-04-10 23:50:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-04-10 23:50:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think someone else has mentioned that place to me before
2014-04-10 23:53:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Baileys might be my favorite liquid on this planet
2014-04-10 23:53:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, yeah?
2014-04-10 23:53:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you ever seen the Old Gregg sketch?
2014-04-10 23:54:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-04-10 23:54:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol I can't think of Bailey's without thinking about it
2014-04-10 23:54:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was like the focus of every band joke in high school 
2014-04-10 23:54:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not even sure if it's actually funny
2014-04-10 23:55:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just so weird
2014-04-10 23:55:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but everyone was quoting it
2014-04-10 23:55:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what a strange little meme that was
2014-04-10 23:56:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very strange 
2014-04-10 23:57:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now it's Tim and Eric
2014-04-10 23:57:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is it?
2014-04-10 23:57:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm out of the loop
2014-04-10 23:57:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe that was like a year ago
2014-04-10 23:57:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I heard so much new pop music during my driving
2014-04-10 23:57:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm all about that John Legend song
2014-04-10 23:57:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that I heard at least five times
2014-04-10 23:58:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I kinda like junk radio for a bit
2014-04-10 23:58:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Zone out
2014-04-10 23:59:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do kids still listen to the radio?
2014-04-10 23:59:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like actual kids
2014-04-10 23:59:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]middle school/high school
2014-04-10 23:59:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If they drive I guess
2014-04-10 23:59:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that music gets played at all their social events 
2014-04-10 23:59:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I wonder why they wouldn't listen to their iPhones or something
2014-04-10 23:59:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-04-10 23:59:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm wondering how they know what's popular
2014-04-11 00:00:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like when I was in school
2014-04-11 00:00:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you listened to the radio
2014-04-11 00:00:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we didn't have iPhones
2014-04-11 00:00:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to get whatever music
2014-04-11 00:00:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so everyone was on the same page
2014-04-11 00:00:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you have iPods?
2014-04-11 00:00:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely not in middle school
2014-04-11 00:00:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably in high school at least
2014-04-11 00:00:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I was the first of my friends to get an iPod
2014-04-11 00:01:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was in high school, but I don't remember which year
2014-04-11 00:01:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was like 13(?)
2014-04-11 00:01:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I had the third generation
2014-04-11 00:02:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-04-11 00:02:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2003
2014-04-11 00:02:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sooo
2014-04-11 00:02:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-04-11 00:02:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would've been 16
2014-04-11 00:02:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably a 16th birthday present
2014-04-11 00:02:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yeah
2014-04-11 00:02:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so we were all still listening to the radio
2014-04-11 00:04:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bet they still listen to the radio or use spotify to'p 40
2014-04-11 00:04:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok I'm off to sleep 
2014-04-11 00:04:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah
2014-04-11 00:04:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that makes sense
2014-04-11 00:04:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-04-11 00:04:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Night
2014-04-11 00:05:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight
2014-04-11 00:36:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Muah
2014-04-11 07:09:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-04-11 07:14:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good morning, beautiful. Have fun at your TG today. Wish I could see it!
2014-04-11 09:13:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good morning darling.
2014-04-11 09:14:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They fixed my computer!
2014-04-11 12:35:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet! Just saw that email. Under warranty too.
2014-04-11 14:06:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I just picked it up and now they're saying the harddrive might still be wonky and not always booting up so I'm a little skeptical that they actually fixed it at all but we'll see
2014-04-11 17:29:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maaan this is even starting to annoy me and it's not even my computer, haha. I hope you're killing your TG!
2014-04-11 17:49:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meh, picking up the computer and getting home took so long I didn't actually get to record myself, but TG was ok
2014-04-11 17:51:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Going to a grill out at Simons on a bit, it's 66 and sunny!!
2014-04-11 17:53:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*in
2014-04-11 18:08:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awesome! Have fun :)
2014-04-11 18:10:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I found out my summer internship ends August 8, which means I'll have two weeks between when that ends and classes start. Sooo something to keep in mind.
2014-04-11 18:11:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found out the tides in Washington will be super shitty in August, so I'll probably be prettyyyy free
2014-04-11 18:12:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aka have to do most of my field work in July/sept

2014-04-11 18:24:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably just do homework :(
2014-04-11 18:25:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aww. Well maybe you can get a Skype chat with drunk me later haha
2014-04-11 18:25:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'd be great :)
2014-04-11 18:29:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty tired today. I kinda just want to have some sex and fall asleep on the couch with you right now.
2014-04-11 19:15:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh man. That would be perfect
2014-04-11 19:15:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That 8-5 must be pretty rough 
2014-04-11 19:21:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pretty :)
2014-04-11 19:22:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have you ever listened to Illmatic?
2014-04-11 19:27:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have! Pretty dope 
2014-04-11 19:34:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I'm digging it so far.
2014-04-11 21:01:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's a new pho place here apparently 
2014-04-11 21:12:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? Gonna check it out I'm assuming?
2014-04-11 21:13:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I just wanted to put it on your radar. In case you wanted to check it out

2014-04-11 22:11:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you wanna Skype? Not hangouts necessarily...
2014-04-11 22:11:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sure I gotta install it first
2014-04-11 22:12:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If it's a hassle it's not a big deal 
2014-04-11 22:12:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah it should only take a couple of minutes
2014-04-11 22:12:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just think it'll work better with my mediocre mac
2014-04-11 22:12:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm kinda curious how it works on Linux anyway
2014-04-11 22:13:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]actually I'm gonna boot into Windows
2014-04-11 23:15:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hi
2014-04-11 23:29:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-04-12 00:23:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ya blocked me    😞 
2014-04-12 00:23:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh no!
2014-04-12 00:24:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whoops
2014-04-12 00:26:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok ask to video me
2014-04-12 01:21:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That was like a three hour video session.
2014-04-12 01:22:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]its hard to tell because Hangouts is so lame    😃 
2014-04-12 01:22:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha haterrr
2014-04-12 01:23:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pretty sure that's a record for me, though.
2014-04-12 01:23:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i think it might be one for me too
2014-04-12 01:23:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it didnt feel like 3 hours at all
2014-04-12 01:24:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I agree. Glad we don't find each other boring.
2014-04-12 01:25:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I loved every minute of it
2014-04-12 01:27:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘
2014-04-12 09:54:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I coulda been watching to Coachella webcast last night instead!
2014-04-12 10:25:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh :(
2014-04-12 10:26:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And could you REALLY?
2014-04-12 10:26:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha good point
2014-04-12 10:27:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I slept in!
2014-04-12 10:28:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wooo
2014-04-12 10:28:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You deserve some good sleep
2014-04-12 10:30:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks :)
2014-04-12 10:30:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What time is the grill out?
2014-04-12 10:33:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like around 1
2014-04-12 10:34:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't get out of bed though
2014-04-12 10:35:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha aw. What is it with animals and sleeping right under your butt?
2014-04-12 10:35:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or on it?
2014-04-12 10:36:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's been doing this since she was 6 weeks old. Maybe some bastardization of a natural instinct?
2014-04-12 10:37:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe animals have been unconsciously bred to be adorable and butt cuddly
2014-04-12 10:37:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha definitely
2014-04-12 10:37:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Plus if you were 9 lbs and could sleep anywhere on me, where would you pick?
2014-04-12 10:38:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha I was actually thinking that. It's probably pretty comfy.
2014-04-12 10:39:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'll just have to settle for the full body cuddle.
2014-04-12 10:39:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's an OK consolation prize ;)
2014-04-12 10:39:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Speak for yourself
2014-04-12 10:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaa
2014-04-12 10:42:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yo what happened to Jon?
2014-04-12 10:42:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have no idea I just saw that too
2014-04-12 10:42:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know he's been traveling 
2014-04-12 10:43:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm well I guess he's alright. That's not the kinda post I like to be seeing, though!
2014-04-12 12:08:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I accidental went back to sleep -_-
2014-04-12 12:08:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's great

2014-04-12 12:16:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fuck condoms dude
2014-04-12 12:16:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they cut circulation off to my dick real bad
2014-04-12 12:16:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would have to agree
2014-04-12 12:16:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha!
2014-04-12 12:16:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you need a size up?
2014-04-12 12:16:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe
2014-04-12 12:17:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Talking about your dick is just gonna frustrate me
2014-04-12 12:18:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha aw I'm sorry
2014-04-12 12:18:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do you think I felt about the show you were giving me last night?
2014-04-12 12:18:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You were shirtless
2014-04-12 12:19:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha fair enough

2014-04-12 12:20:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck
2014-04-12 12:21:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's cute that you still read the tribune

2014-04-12 12:22:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok I'm out. Gotta deal with this sexual frustration quickly so I can get a burger!
2014-04-12 12:22:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha ok
2014-04-12 12:22:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll talk to you later
2014-04-12 13:01:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't wear a sundress cause it'll be too windy  😔  
2014-04-12 13:02:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man    😞  I bet you would've looked really pretty
2014-04-12 13:02:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now I'm gonna look hideous
2014-04-12 13:02:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not going
2014-04-12 13:02:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-12 13:03:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what browser do you use?
2014-04-12 13:04:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Safari 
2014-04-12 13:04:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you have Chrome installed?
2014-04-12 13:05:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's an extension for Chrome that lets you have Hangouts open outside of the browser
2014-04-12 13:05:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you wouldn't need to use Chrome
2014-04-12 13:05:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you would have to have it installed and the extension installed
2014-04-12 13:06:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have chrome, I can play around with it and see
2014-04-12 13:06:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/hangouts/nckgahadagoaajjgafhacjanaoiihapd
2014-04-12 14:38:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-04-12 15:44:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Such a lovely windy sunny afternoon. Someone brought salmon and grilled it up perfectly 
2014-04-12 15:45:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's awesome. I wish I could be there with you.
2014-04-12 15:46:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know. We'll definitely engineer some summery afternoons at the Point when you're in town though 
2014-04-12 15:47:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can't wait    😃 
2014-04-12 15:50:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really appreciate all the little messages you send me. It definitely makes it feel like I'm participating in your life.
2014-04-12 15:53:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm really glad. In a past relationship when I talked about what I was doing and the other person was away or working it just made them sad/jealous that they weren't there too or that I was doing more fun things. Which isn't my intention at all
2014-04-12 15:55:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there was a point in my life where I was the same way
2014-04-12 15:58:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'm glad I caught you at this point then :) I like sharing happy moments and not feeling guilty about them
2014-04-12 16:00:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I think a big part of it is me maturing or whatever, but I also think some of it is just because of the way you are.
2014-04-12 16:01:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I definitely get the sense you're trying to share your happiness with me.
2014-04-12 16:02:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I really just like that you embrace life. It's one of my favorite things about you    😃 
2014-04-12 16:03:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Making me blush, all the time  😍
2014-04-12 16:03:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know wgat happened to Jon!
2014-04-12 16:03:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well fill me in!
2014-04-12 16:04:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He had a blood clot in his lungs, and thought it was just a bad cold for a while until they started filling up with liquid 
2014-04-12 16:05:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what Mo told me via Rob
2014-04-12 16:05:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But he'll be ok
2014-04-12 16:05:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeesh
2014-04-12 16:05:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty scary still
2014-04-12 16:05:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No kidding 
2014-04-12 16:06:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is there a decent crew at the Point?
2014-04-12 16:07:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Everyone just dispersed. I'm at a coffee shop on 53 now reading. But it was Aaron, Kate, Garber, Mo + GF, Adam, Hussein (2nd year CEB), Colin, Alice, and some Human Genetics people  
2014-04-12 16:08:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too windy for frisbee though :-
2014-04-12 16:08:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man. Sounds like a good time, though.
2014-04-12 16:08:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Matute + Casey + baby!
2014-04-12 16:09:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's fun
2014-04-12 16:09:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*Kacy
2014-04-12 16:09:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are they still in Chicago?
2014-04-12 16:09:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even know
2014-04-12 16:09:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry, I barely know them. But she's about to defend and then they're leaving 
2014-04-12 16:10:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The baby is like 3 months old and so delayed her a little 
2014-04-12 16:10:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]makes sense
2014-04-12 19:42:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to a house party of a friend of mine from high school in Wrigleyville
2014-04-12 19:42:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hopefully will avoid the hail on the way home...
2014-04-12 19:43:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. Have fun!
2014-04-12 19:44:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well i'm not leaving yetttt
2014-04-12 19:44:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok haha
2014-04-12 19:44:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty wild you've got a friend from your high school in Chicago
2014-04-12 19:44:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe not
2014-04-12 19:45:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]kinda, he's not a best friend or anything but it was still exciting when he moved here in Feb
2014-04-12 19:45:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just never have time to go see him so I feel like I should take advantage when I can
2014-04-12 19:46:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for sure
2014-04-12 19:46:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is he doing in Chicago?
2014-04-12 19:46:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]trying to make it in the comedy scene
2014-04-12 19:46:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah I think you mentioned him before
2014-04-12 19:47:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gonna be rowdy?
2014-04-12 19:48:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have no idea, I won't know anyone else there unless my friend Priya from Miami comes with
2014-04-12 19:48:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]probably gonna be a fair amount of laughs though haha
2014-04-12 19:48:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, I just feel like comedians only know how to go hard
2014-04-12 19:48:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-12 19:48:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like they're nerdier than you would think, but maybe that's just my impression
2014-04-12 19:49:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, in my experience they're nerdy too
2014-04-12 19:49:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but also go really hard
2014-04-12 19:51:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to now?

2014-04-12 19:54:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pizza is something I definitely don't eat enough considering how much I like it
2014-04-12 19:54:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm delaying the time until I have to put clothes on
2014-04-12 19:54:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely took like a 2 hour nap once I got home
2014-04-12 19:55:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha wow
2014-04-12 19:55:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you not sleep a lot last night?
2014-04-12 19:55:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no I did
2014-04-12 19:55:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]day drinking, even if only slight, wrecks me
2014-04-12 19:55:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no kidding
2014-04-12 19:56:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I just love to sleep
2014-04-12 19:56:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really can't nap unless I get less than five hours of sleep
2014-04-12 19:56:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can get addicted to it
2014-04-12 19:57:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like I don't even need it but I'll just stay in bed until I pass back out
2014-04-12 19:57:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha man, I just really don't even like sleep
2014-04-12 19:57:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have this thing with sleeping and showering
2014-04-12 19:57:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where I absolutely hate both and don't want to do either
2014-04-12 19:58:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you dont like showering?
2014-04-12 19:58:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]until I'm in the process of doing them
2014-04-12 19:58:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in which case I don't want it to end
2014-04-12 19:59:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha I don't really like long showers
2014-04-12 19:59:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I get bored just standing there
2014-04-12 19:59:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]unlesssss
2014-04-12 19:59:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just hate getting out of the shower
2014-04-12 19:59:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like when it's cold
2014-04-12 19:59:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]same thing with getting out of the bed
2014-04-12 20:00:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's a struggle for sure
2014-04-12 20:00:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unlessss what?
2014-04-12 20:01:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]unless I'm doing something more entertaining in the shower haha
2014-04-12 20:01:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh haha
2014-04-12 20:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do you feel about shower sex?
2014-04-12 20:03:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like it occasionally, but it requires a fair amount of coordination
2014-04-12 20:03:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha how so?
2014-04-12 20:04:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so no one falls over of tears down the shower curtain, or to make up for height differences
2014-04-12 20:04:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like it, don;t get me wrong
2014-04-12 20:04:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not judging
2014-04-12 20:04:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually think it's pretty overrated
2014-04-12 20:04:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually don't even know if it's overrated
2014-04-12 20:04:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's something that sounds good in theory
2014-04-12 20:05:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but isn't as great in practice
2014-04-12 20:05:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well it sounds like we're more or less on the same page with that on
2014-04-12 20:05:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*one
2014-04-12 20:07:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I ordered dominos
2014-04-12 20:08:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]update
2014-04-12 20:08:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I appreciate you keeping me up to speed on your pizza situation
2014-04-12 20:08:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't want you worrying
2014-04-12 20:09:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]🍕 
2014-04-12 20:13:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I took a closer looks at my plan of study today and it turns out I only need to take four classes in one of my two remaining semesters
2014-04-12 20:13:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought thats what you already said? Or maybe I misunderstood the 1st time
2014-04-12 20:14:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought I was gonna have to take four for both semesters
2014-04-12 20:14:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you ever listen to that Antony and the Johnsons song?
2014-04-12 20:15:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no I actually meant to ask you the name of them again
2014-04-12 20:16:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]can you resend it

2014-04-12 20:44:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the first few tracks on that album are all pretty amazing
2014-04-12 20:44:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the rest is decent
2014-04-12 20:46:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aKZAopePZpI
2014-04-12 20:46:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i love her
2014-04-12 20:51:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never listened to any Björk
2014-04-12 20:52:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you really like any female singers/groups with a lead female vocalists? just curious
2014-04-12 20:52:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Joanna Newsom
2014-04-12 20:52:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah Yeah Yeahs
2014-04-12 20:52:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]M.I.A.
2014-04-12 20:54:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that might be it of bands I love
2014-04-12 20:54:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok
2014-04-12 20:55:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]some people seem to have a slight preference either way
2014-04-12 20:55:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I have a preference
2014-04-12 20:55:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just don't there are a lot of female leads in the genres I listen to
2014-04-12 21:20:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A preference unto itself, but that makes sense
2014-04-13 00:37:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Omw home now
2014-04-13 00:38:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good ol hour long commute :/
2014-04-13 00:38:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least, right?
2014-04-13 00:38:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I left early enough so I can catch the 6
2014-04-13 00:38:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-04-13 00:38:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Safer too
2014-04-13 00:38:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for sure
2014-04-13 00:39:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was it
2014-04-13 00:39:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-04-13 00:40:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was chill. I only knew one person so it was kinda social overstimulation, but they had cute dogs and birthday cake which is always good
2014-04-13 00:41:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not particularly crazy, but maybe I left too early 
2014-04-13 00:41:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no speedballs?
2014-04-13 00:42:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's a speedball? Like someone cracked out?
2014-04-13 00:43:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]coke + heroine that you put in a syringe
2014-04-13 00:43:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's how a bunch of comedians died
2014-04-13 00:43:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha if there were I wasn't invited to partake
2014-04-13 00:43:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Chris Farley, Jim Belushi, Mitch Hedberg
2014-04-13 00:44:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I knew that, just not the street name 
2014-04-13 00:45:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's the tedious coding?
2014-04-13 00:45:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]terrible
2014-04-13 00:45:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this kind of thing really makes me question my life choices
2014-04-13 00:45:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-13 00:46:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You just gotta get through a little bullshit to get to the good stuff
2014-04-13 00:46:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as long as there's good stuff at the end I suppose
2014-04-13 00:46:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There will be
2014-04-13 00:47:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll make sure of it :)
2014-04-13 00:47:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃  I dig yo optimism 
2014-04-13 00:48:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just chock full for cliches lol
2014-04-13 00:48:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they're positive cliches!
2014-04-13 01:04:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm gonna crash.
2014-04-13 01:04:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-04-13 01:05:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I missed the 6 so I gotta figure out a different way home
2014-04-13 01:06:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. You're downtown?
2014-04-13 01:08:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I'll wait up until you figure it out.
2014-04-13 01:09:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I'm taking the red line down to garfield and then getting a cab
2014-04-13 01:09:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No need to wait up, I'll be ok
2014-04-13 01:11:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. Goodnight
2014-04-13 01:12:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight, talk to you tomorrow!
2014-04-13 01:33:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Home and had the most pleasant cab experience ever through uber
2014-04-13 08:33:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good morning from me and kitty 
2014-04-13 08:35:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, good morning :)
2014-04-13 08:36:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What is uber?
2014-04-13 08:37:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's that cab thing, you've never heard of it? You can order them with your phone and choose between real cabs, private drivers, or regular ppl that have registered
2014-04-13 08:37:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Handsome
2014-04-13 08:38:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah I've never heard of it. I've never been in a situation where I needed a service like that I guess.
2014-04-13 08:39:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should see if they're in Dallas, they can be super cheap cabs
2014-04-13 08:41:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Interesting. Yeah I'll look into it.
2014-04-13 08:51:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's on the agenda for today?
2014-04-13 08:53:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lots of work. I'll probably skip valoise, I'm not in the mood for French toast 
2014-04-13 08:53:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I slept absolutely terribly. I think because of the nap overload.
2014-04-13 08:55:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. That sucks.
2014-04-13 08:55:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're sleeping patterns are pretty odd.
2014-04-13 08:56:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not typically, but this weekend they've been
2014-04-13 08:56:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. Getting up in the middle of the night to drink orange juice?
2014-04-13 08:57:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lots of people wake up for a few minutes in the middle of the night! Haha
2014-04-13 08:58:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe I'm the odd one then.
2014-04-13 08:58:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you doing today?
2014-04-13 08:59:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Homework. I'll probably get started on it as soon as I get out of bed.
2014-04-13 08:59:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably go to the gym too to take a break.
2014-04-13 09:00:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like a plan. 
2014-04-13 09:01:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you work well from home?
2014-04-13 09:01:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]As well as anywhere I guess. What about you?
2014-04-13 09:02:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When's it's not too messy and the cat isn't getting all up in my computer too much
2014-04-13 09:03:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. Yeah, my issue tends to come from the type of work rather than the location. Boring and tedious shit will be hard for me to work on anywhere.
2014-04-13 09:04:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All of my Auburn grad student friends are posting pictures and videos of frogs from their various current locations. I'm jealous :(
2014-04-13 09:04:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you should've stayed in biology ;)
2014-04-13 09:05:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha or just live somewhere that isn't a wasteland for wildlife.
2014-04-13 09:06:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did see a gigantic bullfrog at UTSW the other day, but bullfrogs are kinda evil.
2014-04-13 09:07:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We def gotta do some camping in Big Bend or the hill country while you're in Texas. It's not all bad
2014-04-13 09:07:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But city life can suck for that reason
2014-04-13 09:07:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh I know. I wasn't referring to all of Texas. But that would be a lot of fun.
2014-04-13 09:18:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why are bullfrogs evil? unless it's the invasive/poisonous kind?
2014-04-13 09:28:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They've been introduced all over the world and they eat fucking everything.
2014-04-13 09:28:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm referring to the American Bullfrog here.
2014-04-13 09:38:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not the bullfrogs fault that we introduced it outside of it's native range
2014-04-13 09:39:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Isn't that true for all invasive species?
2014-04-13 09:41:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]for the most part
2014-04-13 09:41:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's why I don't call any of them evil
2014-04-13 09:42:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well I don't actually think they're evil
2014-04-13 09:43:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but there pretty bad for habitats where they are non-native
2014-04-13 09:43:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ick they're
2014-04-13 14:38:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]While on a long run I was thinking more about our discussion about determinism and it's implications for free will
2014-04-13 14:38:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty heavy stuff 
2014-04-13 14:47:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Very. I think I said this before, but my realizing that or buying into it or whatever is the most important shaper of my personal philosophy/world view.
2014-04-13 14:51:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is there anything in particular you thought about?
2014-04-13 14:58:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not convinced the predictability of outcomes with physical laws can be applied to life.
2014-04-13 14:59:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-04-13 15:00:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can talk about it in person sometime, I wrote a bunch of stuff down. 
2014-04-13 15:01:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds good.
2014-04-13 15:07:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It kinda bummed me out lol
2014-04-13 15:09:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw :( Any reason in particular?
2014-04-13 15:11:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And it sounded like you were saying you disagree with the premise before.
2014-04-13 15:11:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I don't know why that'd bum you out.
2014-04-13 15:14:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm still not convinced that we know enough about the universe to verify it, but I think I understand a lot more how you arrived at that conclusion. And either you're right, and then the implications for future societies of humans would almost certainly involve eugenics and all sorts of things that I am currently instinctually against. Or your wrong, which would also be a bummer
2014-04-13 15:14:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*you're 
2014-04-13 15:21:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't see why it would result in eugenics by default, although that's definitely one way things could go. Why would it be a bummer if I was wrong? Because that would mean people are actually evil?
2014-04-13 15:27:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, I guess it would mean you went the majority of your life viewing the world through an incorrect lens 
2014-04-13 15:29:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that wouldn't really bother me. I still behave like free will is real and I'm trying to be a good person, I just also acknowledge it's an illusion.
2014-04-13 15:29:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Being right isn't all that important to me.
2014-04-13 15:33:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Does it bother you I think this way?
2014-04-13 15:33:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're probably right, so it shouldn't 
2014-04-13 15:34:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's talk about it later, I should've waited to bring it up not via text
2014-04-13 15:34:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK :/
2014-04-13 15:37:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I'm just mourning my existential self a little bit. I'll be ok 
2014-04-13 15:40:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. I'm sorry my views bummed you out. I don't actually get into that stuff much with people for exactly that reason.
2014-04-13 15:42:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it makes me a more sympathetic person, and I'm grateful for that.
2014-04-13 15:45:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm mostly worried about how you think this affects my perception of our relationship.
2014-04-13 15:48:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I get it. 
2014-04-13 15:49:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could use a little oxytocin though lol
2014-04-13 15:51:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not too long now.
2014-04-13 15:51:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was actually already feeling pretty bummed today haha
2014-04-13 15:52:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why?
2014-04-13 15:52:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't wait to see you.
2014-04-13 15:52:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just class is really getting me down.
2014-04-13 15:53:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your homework that's due tm, or the project?
2014-04-13 15:54:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All of it.
2014-04-13 15:55:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Only about 2.5 more weeks. Just got to keep that in mind.
2014-04-13 15:55:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just wish the classes were enjoyable you know?
2014-04-13 15:56:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like the subjects. They're just so poorly taught.
2014-04-13 15:57:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if you somehow end up teaching, then you'll know what not to do
2014-04-13 15:57:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the biggest source of stress right now is that I really want to get into a fourth class so I can guaranteed I'll graduate next spring
2014-04-13 15:58:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The thought of another semester here just totally bums me out.
2014-04-13 15:58:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure it will work out
2014-04-13 16:01:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘😘😘😘😘
2014-04-13 16:17:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm feeling funky, how about you?
2014-04-13 16:18:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was feeling pretty funky, but I've been lying in bed kinda letting my kind wander and now I feel mostly ok
2014-04-13 16:18:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Still very much looking forward to seeing you
2014-04-13 16:18:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, that's good to hear
2014-04-13 16:19:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry to have made you feel funky when you've already got school stress on your plate 
2014-04-13 16:19:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's ok.
2014-04-13 16:20:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm thinking maybe long distance relationships weren't really designed to facilitate the kinds of discussions we like having
2014-04-13 16:20:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hah
2014-04-13 16:20:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love that you love talking about this stuff
2014-04-13 16:21:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I love that I can be open about my true thoughts
2014-04-13 16:21:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think it gets kinda bleak at times
2014-04-13 16:21:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and, for me, not having you physically here can make that tough to handle a bit
2014-04-13 16:22:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Agreed
2014-04-13 16:22:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think relying on texting so much doesn't help though
2014-04-13 16:22:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least for me
2014-04-13 16:22:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah that's true
2014-04-13 16:23:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we can make a better effort to call each other more? Or hold off on bringing this stuff up over text? 
2014-04-13 16:23:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or both 
2014-04-13 16:23:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yes, please!
2014-04-13 16:24:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe keep the text stuff a bit lighter. And for pics of you in bed with your kitty    😃 
2014-04-13 16:24:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can do they
2014-04-13 16:24:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*that
2014-04-13 17:02:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you got clothes on?
2014-04-13 17:02:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Panties. I just crawled in bed after showering cause it was cold
2014-04-13 17:03:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sexy    😃 
2014-04-13 17:05:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how would you feel about showing a little more?
2014-04-13 17:06:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha maybe another time. 
2014-04-13 17:06:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I'm in the mood too I'll act on it though ;)
2014-04-13 17:06:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok    😉 
2014-04-13 17:32:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maaan you are sexy
2014-04-13 17:32:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha we'll thank you. Enjoy it, that probably won't happen too often
2014-04-13 17:32:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*well
2014-04-13 17:33:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha damn why you gotta go and say that?
2014-04-13 17:36:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really would like to get my hands on you right now
2014-04-13 17:38:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think we're going to make it up the stairs to your apt when I get there. I won't be able to wait
2014-04-13 17:38:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-04-13 17:40:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know it's kind of self-centered, but it's a big turn on how much you like having sex with me
2014-04-13 17:40:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the fact that you let it be known
2014-04-13 17:41:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As long as that's not the only way I turn you on haha. 
2014-04-13 17:42:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no. You turn me on in a lot of ways.
2014-04-13 17:42:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're basically the definition of the "complete package" in my eyes.
2014-04-13 17:42:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's hard to believe a combination of traits like yours exists.
2014-04-13 17:46:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd have to say the same about you. I had almost decided that there must be some universal trade off between a decent man and sexual chemistry
2014-04-13 17:47:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'm glad I get to be the outlier    😉 
2014-04-13 17:56:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to force myself to like fish
2014-04-13 18:01:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To study? To eat?
2014-04-13 18:02:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]To eat.
2014-04-13 18:02:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I'm letting my ancestors down.
2014-04-13 18:19:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fish is pretty freakin tasty
2014-04-13 18:20:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can make teriyaki salmon some time. It tastes just like teriyaki chicken but a different texture (and better)
2014-04-13 18:20:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That might be a good way to get me started.
2014-04-13 18:20:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just feel like I'm missing out on something fundamentally human
2014-04-13 18:20:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-13 18:32:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh I guess
2014-04-13 18:32:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok I'm off to Simons 
2014-04-13 18:33:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Talk to you later!
2014-04-13 18:33:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]byyye!
2014-04-13 22:11:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I see you joined snapchat
2014-04-13 22:11:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah, my sister got me on it
2014-04-13 22:11:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, I just saw yours... my first snap to my sister was of me sticking my tongue out!
2014-04-13 22:12:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Typical snap haha
2014-04-13 22:16:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I briefly mentioned my inner debate earlier, mentioning it was based on a previous conversation. At least 3 ppl had also considered the topic quite a bit
2014-04-13 22:17:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Determinism/free will?
2014-04-13 22:18:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-04-13 22:19:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Max and Dallas and even Aaron a bit
2014-04-13 22:19:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what'd they think?
2014-04-13 22:19:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not surprised any of those guys have thought about it a lot
2014-04-13 22:19:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-13 22:19:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm kinda bummed you didn't say the convo was with me!
2014-04-13 22:20:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did say it was with you that sparked it! Max has come to very similar conclusions as you for 
2014-04-13 22:20:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Similar reasons 
2014-04-13 22:20:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not surprised.
2014-04-13 22:20:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dallas interjected a few comments but we kinda aren't really speaking right now...
2014-04-13 22:21:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh really?
2014-04-13 22:21:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know you had said things were kinda weird recently.
2014-04-13 22:23:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, maybe we're both acting immature concurrently but I really don't like ppl talking shit undeservedly behind my back and am just not in the mood got his general juvenile tactics 
2014-04-13 22:23:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't wanna talk about it
2014-04-13 22:24:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-04-13 22:25:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not a big deal either way. Simon made some amazing baked pasta though and I got to take home the leftovers 
2014-04-13 22:25:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ballin'
2014-04-13 22:25:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm set for meals until I fly to houston :)
2014-04-13 22:25:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have ten meals set?
2014-04-13 22:25:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or I guess it's 9
2014-04-13 22:26:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ehh not quite 
2014-04-13 22:26:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll probably incorporate some food trucks
2014-04-13 22:27:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Food trucks are where it's at.
2014-04-13 22:29:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh man, you're killing me with these snaps
2014-04-13 22:29:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]too much sexiness
2014-04-13 22:30:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think this could be an interesting collaboration
2014-04-13 22:30:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha I like the sound of that    😉 
2014-04-13 22:38:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The Snapchat delivery method makes me nervous
2014-04-13 22:38:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]all those contacts right next to each other
2014-04-13 22:38:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how many dick pics have been accidentally sent to the wrong person I wonder?
2014-04-13 22:42:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never received a dick pic via snapchat. Accidental or otherwise  
2014-04-13 22:42:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, still it's gotta happen
2014-04-13 22:42:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh lawdy
2014-04-13 22:43:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't drunk chat neked pics
2014-04-13 22:43:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like I'll just be walking around with a hard-on for the next 10 days
2014-04-13 22:44:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should do something to take care of that. I don't want you to be in pain...
2014-04-13 22:45:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha man, listen to you!
2014-04-13 22:46:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's gonna be good when we see each other
2014-04-13 22:47:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You definitely get my libido all riled up in a way it's not usually. 
2014-04-13 22:47:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry if I'm coming off too strong 
2014-04-13 22:48:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]absolutely not
2014-04-13 22:49:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually have noticed that you seem... "ready to go" with little notice
2014-04-13 22:50:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like how turned on you get
2014-04-13 22:50:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it gets me going even more
2014-04-13 22:53:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still think it's something about you, some pheromones or subtle cue.
2014-04-13 22:53:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aside from your pretty impressive equipment  😳
2014-04-13 22:53:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-13 22:54:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I could get into me being partially responsible for your active libido
2014-04-13 22:54:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]appeals to my cocky side    😉 
2014-04-13 22:55:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-04-13 22:58:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's pretty rad that we can transition from talking about the impacts of a deterministic universe on free will to how much we enjoy sex with each other
2014-04-13 22:59:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is
2014-04-13 22:59:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though definitely not mutually exclusive ideas haha
2014-04-13 23:00:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm how so?
2014-04-13 23:00:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess no human action can be separated from the concept of free will
2014-04-13 23:01:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I was thinking we can still really enjoy sex with each other and be on a deterministic path   
2014-04-13 23:02:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh no doubt
2014-04-13 23:02:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you might say we have no choice but to really enjoy sex with each other
2014-04-13 23:02:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's how the universe was intended to be    😉 
2014-04-13 23:03:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha quite romantic in its own right 
2014-04-13 23:03:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I agree
2014-04-13 23:03:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that last pic is burned in my brain right now
2014-04-13 23:04:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you are sexy as fuck
2014-04-13 23:04:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha

2014-04-13 23:58:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm gonna go to sleep. Gonna be grinding until you get here it looks like.
2014-04-13 23:59:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet dreams, sugar 😘
2014-04-13 23:59:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmk. I'm watching some netfix. Good night and sweet dreams too!
2014-04-14 11:09:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww, what a happy kitty
2014-04-14 11:11:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's making it too easy to stay in bed
2014-04-14 11:12:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was a littleeee bit tipsy last night haha
2014-04-14 11:12:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too much wine
2014-04-14 11:15:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I was a fan of the results ;)
2014-04-14 11:33:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I ordered 2 med pizza on Saturday (bc it's a much better deal) and now I feel like I have to eat pizza for breakfast every day this week to get rid of it
2014-04-14 11:34:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol you're goofy.
2014-04-14 15:56:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey. I think I'm going to try to stay off the grid until 11 PM for the next nine days. Just wanted to let you know I'm not ignoring you if you message me. Hopefully it pays off. I'm pretty on edge!
2014-04-14 15:57:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll make sure to not provide any distractions. Take a deep breath, I'll talk to you tonight!
2014-04-14 15:58:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks 😘
2014-04-14 23:00:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yooooooooo
2014-04-14 23:01:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]11 on the dot
2014-04-14 23:02:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's like waiting for the school bell
2014-04-14 23:02:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Productive day?
2014-04-14 23:02:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I worked a lot
2014-04-14 23:02:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not sure if it was productive
2014-04-14 23:03:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]writing assembly is really frustrating
2014-04-14 23:03:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and slow moving
2014-04-14 23:03:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and utterly pointless
2014-04-14 23:03:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-14 23:03:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could write this program in literally 30 minutes in Python
2014-04-14 23:03:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-04-14 23:03:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sorry I have been complaining so much
2014-04-14 23:03:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have never been close to this stressed out about school before
2014-04-14 23:04:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't want you to think this is who I am
2014-04-14 23:04:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Complain away my dear
2014-04-14 23:05:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just gonna trust my past ability to perform well in stressful situations will continue
2014-04-14 23:06:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's the only way to do it
2014-04-14 23:06:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure an undergrad class is not gonna be the thing to break you 
2014-04-14 23:06:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no, but all my classes collectively might
2014-04-14 23:07:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm gonna put that worry off until tomorrow morning at 7:30 for now
2014-04-14 23:07:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-14 23:07:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let me get some quality Katie time in
2014-04-14 23:07:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how has your day been?
2014-04-14 23:08:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not bad, overall pretty productive
2014-04-14 23:08:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My computer has a new trick!
2014-04-14 23:08:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It wont charge haha
2014-04-14 23:09:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awww
2014-04-14 23:09:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's dead?
2014-04-14 23:09:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-04-14 23:09:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn, dude

2014-04-14 23:11:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have the ipad though at least 
2014-04-14 23:13:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you gonna check out the lunar eclipse tonight?
2014-04-14 23:14:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Completely overcast
2014-04-14 23:14:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Damn
2014-04-14 23:14:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And been snowing most of the day
2014-04-14 23:14:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh yeah
2014-04-14 23:14:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-14 23:14:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man
2014-04-14 23:14:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's brutal
2014-04-14 23:14:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was pretty bad
2014-04-14 23:15:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And is sticking on cars
2014-04-14 23:15:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I don't miss that part of Chicago
2014-04-14 23:15:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]snow in the middle of April is a little ridiculous
2014-04-14 23:19:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you going to watch it?
2014-04-14 23:19:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I think so
2014-04-14 23:19:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need some cosmic perspective in my life right now
2014-04-14 23:21:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love meteor showers
2014-04-14 23:21:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too. I haven't watched one in a long time, unfortunately.
2014-04-14 23:22:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]City life makes it tough.
2014-04-14 23:22:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe we can check out the Perseids together?
2014-04-14 23:23:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would absolutely love to
2014-04-14 23:23:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, man. That last snap had me loling
2014-04-14 23:23:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I missed them last year
2014-04-14 23:24:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Im not good at fake smiling, unless I'm pretty tipsy
2014-04-14 23:24:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe it's not fake in that case?
2014-04-14 23:25:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Smiling on command may be a better way of putting it
2014-04-14 23:25:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gotcha
2014-04-14 23:28:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's been a slight change of plan with the car
2014-04-14 23:29:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm buying back my old green crv and am just gonna drive it into the ground
2014-04-14 23:29:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good
2014-04-14 23:29:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we won't be driving in quite as nice of style lol
2014-04-14 23:30:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, doesn't bother me.
2014-04-14 23:30:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I drove beaters basically from 16 through college
2014-04-14 23:30:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I actually missed it a lot
2014-04-14 23:31:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, well that's exciting you'll be getting it back
2014-04-14 23:32:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And me buying it is really just me paying back what I got paid for it in July, so its no net loss for me
2014-04-14 23:33:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I'm sure it'll be nice having a car again.
2014-04-14 23:33:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just finished listening to Phosphene Dream
2014-04-14 23:33:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm digging this rocker edge you got going
2014-04-14 23:33:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I would've guessed it.
2014-04-14 23:33:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha why not?
2014-04-14 23:34:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess just cuz talking to you it's been all EDM and softer indie stuff
2014-04-14 23:35:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like it, though. I can totally imagine you rocking out.
2014-04-14 23:36:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I saw The Black Angels open for The Black Keys in Atlanta when I was in college
2014-04-14 23:36:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I barely remember that show for some reason, though.
2014-04-14 23:36:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That sounds like a great fucking show
2014-04-14 23:37:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can get down with most music except pop country and really heavy metal. I can definitely do punk though
2014-04-14 23:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I guess I'm the same way.
2014-04-14 23:38:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well except I don't like "abstract" stuff too, apparently    😉 
2014-04-14 23:38:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was probably misstepping with that statement lol
2014-04-14 23:39:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's all good, it was an interesting discussion
2014-04-14 23:40:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Music night is happening again on thursday
2014-04-14 23:41:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That makes me really happy
2014-04-14 23:41:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]At Roberto's?
2014-04-14 23:41:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sara's
2014-04-14 23:42:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. That'll be fun.
2014-04-14 23:46:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you doing now?
2014-04-14 23:47:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]listening to some Yeah Yeah Yeahs
2014-04-14 23:47:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your punk comment got me craving some
2014-04-14 23:47:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what about you?
2014-04-14 23:48:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are they punk? I guess I never thought about them that way
2014-04-14 23:48:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would say they were definitely punk early on
2014-04-14 23:49:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's Blitz! Isn't really at all
2014-04-14 23:49:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure if Show Your Bones has any punky tracks either
2014-04-14 23:49:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but Fever to Tell is pretty punky
2014-04-14 23:49:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and their first release
2014-04-14 23:49:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]their self-titled EP
2014-04-14 23:49:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is definitely punky
2014-04-14 23:50:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's what I'm listening to
2014-04-14 23:50:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably been a while since I listened to that one 
2014-04-14 23:50:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's old as eff
2014-04-14 23:50:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2001
2014-04-14 23:50:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's crazy
2014-04-14 23:51:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one of my professor's university website has pop up ads, lol
2014-04-14 23:52:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no apostrophe I guess
2014-04-14 23:53:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ads for the website?
2014-04-14 23:53:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like you get pop up ads if you go to his site
2014-04-14 23:53:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And yes apostrophe?
2014-04-14 23:54:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's because he has this third party website stats thing
2014-04-14 23:54:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's probably what's serving the ads
2014-04-14 23:54:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know about the apostrophe
2014-04-14 23:54:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's an awkward sentence
2014-04-14 23:54:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I said one of
2014-04-14 23:54:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's one of my professors
2014-04-14 23:54:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no apostrophe
2014-04-14 23:55:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should have said something like Dr. Ng, one of my professors, has pop up ads on his website
2014-04-14 23:55:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Word
2014-04-14 23:59:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think the eclipse is now
2014-04-14 23:59:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it doesn't peak until 1:00
2014-04-14 23:59:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll go check real quick, though
2014-04-15 00:01:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah it's just starting nvm
2014-04-15 00:29:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice hat
2014-04-15 00:29:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha thanks
2014-04-15 00:39:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you see anything?
2014-04-15 00:40:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not yet.
2014-04-15 00:40:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna head back out in a few.
2014-04-15 00:40:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok then I'll probably just say goodnight
2014-04-15 00:40:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-04-15 00:41:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet dreams
2014-04-15 00:57:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Take some pics if it's big enough!
2014-04-15 00:58:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I snapped a couple using my camera + binoculars already. They actually turned out decent. I'll try to get a couple when it's a little more interesting.
2014-04-15 00:58:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kinda cool you can use your binoculars with your camera
2014-04-15 00:59:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#OpticsFTW
2014-04-15 00:59:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not sleepy
2014-04-15 01:00:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well why don't you keep talking to me then?
2014-04-15 01:00:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't you need to get up in 6 hrs?
2014-04-15 01:02:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fuck that class.
2014-04-15 01:02:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you gonna skip it when I'm there?
2014-04-15 01:02:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There's a little nibble out of the moon.
2014-04-15 01:02:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably.
2014-04-15 01:03:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not that I support that obviously
2014-04-15 01:03:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If he didn't have his bullshit no laptops rule I might go more knowing I could work on other stuff while he was wasting my time.
2014-04-15 01:04:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Boom
2014-04-15 01:04:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-15 01:24:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Phone + binoculars. The ones on my camera look a lot better.
2014-04-15 01:25:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's awesome!
2014-04-15 01:25:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm so jealous
2014-04-15 01:25:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's pretty sweet.
2014-04-15 01:35:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My setup
2014-04-15 01:36:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The moon's starting to get a little red.
2014-04-15 01:36:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Looks like you could use someone to bundle up with and keep you warm
2014-04-15 01:38:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'd be nice :)
2014-04-15 01:38:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think some star gazing would make for a pretty nice night for us.
2014-04-15 01:40:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]August 12, I got it in my calendar 
2014-04-15 01:40:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though hopefully is won't be in the 30s-40s....
2014-04-15 01:41:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It better not be!
2014-04-15 01:45:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our setup 
2014-04-15 01:46:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha looks comfy
2014-04-15 01:48:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder what cavemen thought was going on when lunar eclipses occurred.
2014-04-15 01:49:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Magic
2014-04-15 01:53:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm kinda jealous
2014-04-15 01:53:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's still pretty cool, even when you know why it happens 
2014-04-15 01:58:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No doubt. Just a different kind of awe I guess.
2014-04-15 01:58:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It kinda looks like an eyeball right now.
2014-04-15 01:59:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pretty fucking cool. Glad I watched.
2014-04-15 02:00:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will you post the eyeball pic?
2014-04-15 02:01:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The eyeball one didn't really come out because the moon was too dark. I'll post the pics I took, though.
2014-04-15 02:03:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll see if I can find a pic online so you can see what I mean. It looks like a lateral view if an eyeball.
2014-04-15 02:04:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm
2014-04-15 02:08:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]While you do that, I think I actually can drift off to sleep now. 
2014-04-15 02:09:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe after 11p tm we can chat a little more interactively? If you aren't busy 
2014-04-15 02:09:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sounds good.
2014-04-15 02:10:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool :)
2014-04-15 02:10:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sleep tight 
2014-04-15 02:11:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet dreams, beatiful
2014-04-15 02:23:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://twitter.com/search?q=%23LunarEclipse&src=tren&mode=photos
2014-04-15 02:23:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oops
2014-04-15 02:23:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BlPs0-dCQAEFbxw.jpg:large
2014-04-15 02:23:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not perfect
2014-04-15 02:24:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it reminded me of this
2014-04-15 02:24:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.feinberg.northwestern.edu/gfx/news/Small_Eyeball.jpg
2014-04-15 02:24:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can definitely see it
2014-04-15 02:26:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dalas T.X? 
2014-04-15 02:26:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-04-15 02:26:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, whoops

2014-04-15 02:27:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks. I was definitely surprised by how well that actually worked, haha.
2014-04-15 02:27:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Eff, every picture says Dalas, T.X.
2014-04-15 02:30:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's so late in sure no one saw
2014-04-15 02:30:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you're probably right
2014-04-15 02:31:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should probably get to sleep too, though
2014-04-15 02:31:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Night (again)

2014-04-15 23:16:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]any more absurdity in ethics?
2014-04-15 23:16:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We talked about harassment and diversity, but pretty standard discussion patterns 
2014-04-15 23:16:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-04-15 23:21:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Chilling at home now?

2014-04-15 23:23:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel a little bit better today
2014-04-15 23:23:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I was working on my Stats for ML homework
2014-04-15 23:24:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I actually got a lot done
2014-04-15 23:24:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]usually these assignments take me a really long time
2014-04-15 23:24:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like several days
2014-04-15 23:24:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm mostly done

2014-04-16 01:01:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's good for you that I still think you look good even when you think you look bad?
2014-04-16 01:01:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good for me too I reckon
2014-04-16 01:02:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah I guess. I'm just anticipating when you realize the goofy/awkward side usually outnumbers the sexy side 
2014-04-16 01:03:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I've already realized    😉 
2014-04-16 01:03:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah I'm just playing
2014-04-16 01:03:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're sexy and goofy all the time
2014-04-16 01:03:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no reason they have to be separate!
2014-04-16 01:08:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]#SnapChat
2014-04-16 01:09:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-04-16 01:09:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm dying.
2014-04-16 01:09:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Exactly like that :)
2014-04-16 01:10:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That would've been some prime blackmail. Good thing you don't know how to screenshot lol
2014-04-16 01:13:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I actually thought about that. Not with you specifically, but how the app might give people a false sense of security.
2014-04-16 01:13:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It tells you when you're pic gets screenshotted(?)
2014-04-16 01:13:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*your fuck what is wrong 
2014-04-16 01:14:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's pretty interesting.
2014-04-16 01:14:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I bet there's a workaround on Android.
2014-04-16 01:15:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Incentive to send like 3 sec snaps. Or not racy ones
2014-04-16 01:15:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But where's the fun in that?
2014-04-16 01:16:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never sent a half naked snap until the one I sent you
2014-04-16 01:16:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then I sent one to allllll my friends 
2014-04-16 01:17:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Huh?
2014-04-16 01:17:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just kiddinggg
2014-04-16 01:17:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, I wasn't sure what you were getting at!
2014-04-16 01:17:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm honored I'm your first!
2014-04-16 01:17:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I guess you didn't say you hadn't sent a full naked one    😉 
2014-04-16 01:19:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah, though you are the first current boyfriend I'm friends with on there
2014-04-16 01:20:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that makes it less impressive
2014-04-16 01:20:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-16 01:20:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but also makes more sense I suppose
2014-04-16 09:33:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey, you referred to me as "boyfriend"
2014-04-16 09:33:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hope you have a great day. I'll talk to you later.
2014-04-16 09:37:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You knoww what I meant. Have a great day too, guybuddy
2014-04-16 22:03:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm done for the day.
2014-04-16 22:04:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"guybuddy" has to be the most awkward word ever.
2014-04-16 22:07:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah, came up with it all by mahself
2014-04-16 22:13:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How you doin'?
2014-04-16 22:18:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm good. Had a relatively productive day, worked out, and watched some Dollhouse
2014-04-16 22:18:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dropped my computer off -_-
2014-04-16 22:18:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, I've given up hope for your computer
2014-04-16 22:19:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You and me both
2014-04-16 22:19:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You do zumba?
2014-04-16 22:19:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah I decided to run in the treadmill and then do abs
2014-04-16 22:19:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*on
2014-04-16 22:20:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna get all high and mighty and say ab work doesn't do anything
2014-04-16 22:20:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It can't hurt
2014-04-16 22:20:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I suppose so
2014-04-16 22:21:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And strengthening your core is important for running endurance. 
2014-04-16 22:21:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And keeping off the lil love handles haha
2014-04-16 22:21:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well... it doesn't really keep off love handles is the thing.
2014-04-16 22:21:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What ab work do you do?
2014-04-16 22:23:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah you're mostly right, but I guess I try to do more HIIT type stuff 
2014-04-16 22:23:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://fitness.mercola.com/sites/fitness/archive/2011/08/20/new-research-shows-abdominal-exercises-do-not-reduce-your-belly-fat.aspx
2014-04-16 22:24:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It definitely dies something, it just doesn't make you skinny 
2014-04-16 22:24:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*does
2014-04-16 22:24:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Right. It makes you better at doing ab workouts.
2014-04-16 22:24:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-16 22:25:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm being gym smug
2014-04-16 22:25:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I apologize
2014-04-16 22:26:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know. I have plenty of comments about lifting but I keep them to myself :)
2014-04-16 22:26:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha oh man
2014-04-16 22:26:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now you got me curious
2014-04-16 22:32:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It really depends on what your fitness goal is, but people who exclude cardio and just focus on building muscle mass for aesthetic aren't necessarily improving cardiovascular health 
2014-04-16 22:34:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fair enough. I guess I don't really know anyone who thinks they're improving their cardio health by lifting weights, though.
2014-04-16 22:35:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly, though it would be pretty beneficial to life expectancy if they just did cardio once a week even if it meant losing a couple pounds of bulging muscle
2014-04-16 22:36:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha true, but aren't you the one who doesn't want to make it past 70?
2014-04-16 22:38:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd still like to make it to 70 though, something that is pretty rare in my family history 
2014-04-16 23:38:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You shaved your beard?!
2014-04-16 23:38:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah!
2014-04-16 23:38:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You positioned the text right over it though so I couldn't really tell
2014-04-16 23:39:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh I didn't even think to move the text.
2014-04-16 23:39:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]N00b
2014-04-16 23:39:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Snapchat makes me feel like an old person
2014-04-16 23:40:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I tried replying to my sister the first day I was using it and I sent a pic without any text, haha
2014-04-16 23:40:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can understand that. It kinda makes me feel like one too
2014-04-16 23:41:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you like gingerbread flavoring?
2014-04-16 23:41:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ummm
2014-04-16 23:41:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like gingerbread ok?
2014-04-16 23:42:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I'd ever seek it out.
2014-04-16 23:42:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a package of gingerbread oreos, and they are superrrr tasty. But I'm not gonna finish them 
2014-04-16 23:42:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And they might make a magical milkshake 
2014-04-16 23:43:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, well I'd be down with giving them a shot
2014-04-16 23:44:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My mom gave me her digital copy of Frozen
2014-04-16 23:45:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you tell her I wanted to watch it?
2014-04-16 23:45:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did.
2014-04-16 23:46:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm betting $100 you fall asleep 
2014-04-16 23:46:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-16 23:46:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hey!
2014-04-16 23:46:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]depends what time we watch it
2014-04-16 23:47:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and whether or not it's preceded by some sex
2014-04-16 23:47:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we started treasure island around 9:30 haha
2014-04-16 23:47:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-16 23:47:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for real?
2014-04-16 23:47:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe earlier 
2014-04-16 23:47:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man, that's so funny
2014-04-16 23:47:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's really not like me
2014-04-16 23:47:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I did it twice!
2014-04-16 23:48:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Does sex usually make you sleepy?
2014-04-16 23:48:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess so
2014-04-16 23:49:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more like really relaxed I guess
2014-04-16 23:49:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Makes sense 
2014-04-16 23:53:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might actually crash soonish. Long day tomorrow and I can't sleep in until 9 like I have been 
2014-04-16 23:53:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good, maybe I'll follow you
2014-04-16 23:54:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Follow me into my bed?! :)))
2014-04-16 23:54:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish
2014-04-16 23:54:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'm sorry my jokes are so lame
2014-04-16 23:54:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, nah I like it
2014-04-16 23:56:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just sent you my assembly code
2014-04-16 23:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]look at what a clusterfuck it is
2014-04-16 23:58:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a lot of chars
2014-04-16 23:58:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you get as far as you wanted?
2014-04-16 23:58:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I finished the bit we talked about me doing.
2014-04-16 23:58:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which means I'm feeling better today too.
2014-04-16 23:58:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hopefully I can keep it up.
2014-04-16 23:58:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yay!
2014-04-16 23:59:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]assembly is so miserable
2014-04-16 23:59:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'll say it one more time, don't kill yourself to finish up stuff before I get there 
2014-04-17 00:00:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm ok with you working a bit, as long as I get your undivided attention after 11p 
2014-04-17 00:00:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP];)
2014-04-17 00:00:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, well I appreciate you saying that, but it's honestly in my best interest just to keep this up for the time being.
2014-04-17 00:01:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm going to San Diego the next weekend after you're here.
2014-04-17 00:01:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And gonna just be driving for two full days.
2014-04-17 00:01:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I gotta be moving at some point.
2014-04-17 00:01:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So it's best I get ahead if I can.
2014-04-17 00:03:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True true. It'll be crazy hectic but hopefully still a pretty net good month for you
2014-04-17 00:03:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Seeing you pretty much makes it golden regardless.
2014-04-17 00:05:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Counting down the hours at this point

2014-04-17 00:24:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah, I want to participate! I like getting the pics from you, it only makes sense to reciprocate    😃

2014-04-18 00:56:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only trying to repay the favor, that towel does not do a very good job of hiding what's going on underneath ;)
2014-04-18 00:58:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha man it's gonna be good to see you. Sweet dreams 😘
2014-04-18 18:32:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WTF is up?

2014-04-20 13:14:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*grant proposal
2014-04-20 13:15:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oooh intense.
2014-04-20 13:16:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well, that's a tough call I suppose.
2014-04-20 13:17:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I typically try to be social unless I'm completely cornered.
2014-04-20 13:17:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which it sounds like you're close to being
2014-04-20 13:17:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh
2014-04-20 13:18:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll probably go hang out around 4 and just work really hard tm/Tuesday morning
2014-04-20 13:19:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-04-20 13:20:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's your work coming?
2014-04-20 13:21:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't done anything today.
2014-04-20 13:21:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll get started after bball
2014-04-20 13:21:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All I've done today is put away my laundry.
2014-04-20 13:21:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And finished House of Cards season 2
2014-04-20 13:21:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like a pretty good Sunday
2014-04-20 13:22:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's aight I suppose
2014-04-20 13:25:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're kinda coming across as a little bummed out, but maybe it's just distracted typing from both of us?
2014-04-20 13:25:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I feel a little bummed out!
2014-04-20 13:26:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's interesting you could pick up on it.
2014-04-20 13:27:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I've chatted with you enough to tell deviations haha. Why do you think that is?
2014-04-20 13:30:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I experienced a little twinge of doubt earlier, but I'm probably just being paranoid.
2014-04-20 13:31:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]paranoid might not even be the right word
2014-04-20 13:31:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just worrying for no reason
2014-04-20 13:31:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]neurotic is probably more appropriate
2014-04-20 13:31:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-20 13:32:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]About me smoking with certain people, I assume
2014-04-20 13:33:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah, not with certain people
2014-04-20 13:33:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more the fact that I don't smoke and you do
2014-04-20 13:33:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm just going off of how things went when I was with Hannah
2014-04-20 13:33:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but she didn't like smoking around me for some reason
2014-04-20 13:33:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I think it made her unhappy
2014-04-20 13:33:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and resent me maybe
2014-04-20 13:34:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I think smoking is really important to people who od
2014-04-20 13:34:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do
2014-04-20 13:34:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I've wondered whether a smoker and a non-smoker can really be completely in sync
2014-04-20 13:34:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've thought about this stuff before you by the wya
2014-04-20 13:35:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just resurfacing now
2014-04-20 13:36:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least in my case, I don't think the action itself is as important to me as not being judged by you about it
2014-04-20 13:39:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I guess it's just something that is such a big part of people's lives that they'd want to be sharing it with someone.
2014-04-20 13:39:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. It doesn't really matter.
2014-04-20 13:41:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No point in worrying about it.
2014-04-20 13:41:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-04-20 13:42:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I won't bring it up as much
2014-04-20 13:43:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol see you saying that is basically confirming exactly what I was saying
2014-04-20 13:44:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have you ever dated a non-smoker?
2014-04-20 13:46:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've dated someone who only liked to smoke very rarely
2014-04-20 13:47:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I obviously didn't smoke with my high school boyfriend 
2014-04-20 13:48:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't have a problem with you not smoking, I just get bummed out about these hypothetical thought tangents you sometimes go on about reasons why we won't work out. And if that means being slightly less specific about what I'm doing when chilling with friends to avoid those concerns that's fine by me
2014-04-20 13:51:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It has nothing to do with you talking to me about it. It has to do with the fact that that's who you are. I wasn't even going to mention it.
2014-04-20 13:53:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should buy into the fact of you saying my non-smoking is a non-issue.
2014-04-20 13:55:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I absolutely do not want you not sharing certain aspects of your life with me.
2014-04-20 13:55:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's the opposite of what I want.
2014-04-20 13:56:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'll breed exactly the kind of resentment and distance I'm trying to avoid.
2014-04-20 13:57:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-04-20 13:59:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you do have issues with me smoking beyond trying to imagine my future opinions about you, you should let me know though.
2014-04-20 14:02:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I 100% do not.
2014-04-20 14:02:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool
2014-04-20 17:11:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you know what you're doing next Christmas?
2014-04-20 17:11:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-20 17:37:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I don't haha. What are your plans?
2014-04-20 17:38:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My dad is trying to organize a trip to Disney World the week before Christmas. He likes to plan things ridiculously far in advance... so he wanted me to ask you if it'd be possible for you to attend.
2014-04-20 17:38:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I already told him most people don't know what they're doing that far in advance
2014-04-20 17:38:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]especially grad students
2014-04-20 17:39:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, it would probably depend on the state of my proposal, which us kind of hard to imagine. But I'm obviously not opposed to the idea
2014-04-20 17:40:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. That should be adequate for him.
2014-04-20 17:40:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how's Easter dinner?
2014-04-20 17:41:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Spent a couple hours on the roof, think I might've even gotten a tan!
2014-04-20 17:41:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dinner is in the process
2014-04-20 17:41:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as in you're eating?
2014-04-20 17:42:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cocino
2014-04-20 17:43:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're cooking?
2014-04-20 17:57:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cocines? Haha I am cutting up some of the veggies 
2014-04-20 18:36:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're beautiful yo
2014-04-20 18:54:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fancy lighting obscures everything haha
2014-04-20 19:30:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gosh I can't wait to be next to you
2014-04-20 19:38:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too. I was just lying here with my eyes closed because I've got a headache and I was daydreaming about when I first see you on Wednesday.
2014-04-20 19:56:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I'm sorry you have a headache 
2014-04-20 20:02:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all good. I think it's getting better.
2014-04-20 20:14:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My mom is "intrigued by the tuba"
2014-04-20 20:14:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-04-20 20:16:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha well I probably won't play for her very often 
2014-04-20 20:17:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah she was just asking questions about it
2014-04-20 20:17:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I guess I like the romanticizing 
2014-04-20 20:18:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-04-20 20:18:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That she is intrigued by something she hadn't heard 
2014-04-20 20:23:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha, she's a nut
2014-04-20 20:24:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she said she wants to video chat with me while you're here so she can meet you
2014-04-20 20:24:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and she wants to see your tuba
2014-04-20 20:24:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well the tuba def won't be there 
2014-04-20 20:25:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'd love to video message with her 
2014-04-20 20:27:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-04-20 20:34:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-04-20 20:34:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That face 
2014-04-20 21:08:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. Noelle's boyfriend has been sick all day today so she hasn't been to any of the shows.
2014-04-20 21:08:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Neutral Milk Hotel and Arcade Fire are today    😞 
2014-04-20 22:45:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a big bummer 
2014-04-20 22:49:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd hope if that happened to us you'd keep going to shows
2014-04-20 22:49:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And report back :)
2014-04-20 22:49:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, I guess it would depend on how sick you were
2014-04-20 22:56:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-04-20 22:59:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Home now. I definitely fell asleep for the last 15 min of thrones 
2014-04-20 22:59:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-20 23:00:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The wine did you in?
2014-04-20 23:01:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd you know I had wine? Haha was it in a snapchat?
2014-04-20 23:01:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah!
2014-04-20 23:02:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You even said "wino" in it
2014-04-20 23:02:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-04-20 23:02:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh dear
2014-04-20 23:02:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mildly intoxicated were we?
2014-04-20 23:03:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was probably the wine + marijuana+carb heavy dish*waking up at 7:30a 
2014-04-20 23:03:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds like a recipe for sleepiness for you
2014-04-20 23:04:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As I'm sure you're discovering, most things are haha
2014-04-20 23:05:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I guess that particular combo just seems like a guarantee from what I've gathered so far.
2014-04-20 23:06:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-04-20 23:06:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Weird snapchat on the way, mostly in reply to one of my brothers 
2014-04-20 23:09:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fine, I won't send you the abstract ones anymore :)
2014-04-20 23:09:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I was cracking up
2014-04-21 00:15:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm excited about seeing a show with you?
2014-04-21 00:15:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, are you confused about it?
2014-04-21 00:15:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I'm excited too.
2014-04-21 00:15:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh
2014-04-21 00:15:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know what I mean
2014-04-21 00:15:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That person hasn't emailed me back, though    😕 
2014-04-21 00:17:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I guess we have a few days. And if that falls through I'm sure we can find other ways to entertain ourselves that evening :)
2014-04-21 00:17:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For sure. Hopefully it works out, though. I'm trying to get my dance on with you.
2014-04-21 00:23:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tessa
2014-04-21 00:23:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*yesss
2014-04-21 00:23:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Stupid autocorrect
2014-04-21 00:23:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, that's a pretty good one
2014-04-21 00:23:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're getting so close!
2014-04-21 00:23:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pumped.
2014-04-21 00:24:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So close. It's gonna be great
2014-04-21 00:33:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Daft Punk just did a guest opening for Arcade Fire
2014-04-21 00:34:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I'm so jealous
2014-04-21 00:34:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hell yeah
2014-04-21 00:35:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All the best Collabs happen at Coachella 
2014-04-21 00:35:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]need to go
2014-04-21 00:35:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt
2014-04-21 00:35:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Coachella 2015
2014-04-21 00:35:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good optimism 
2014-04-21 00:36:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though you'll still probably be swamped with work haha
2014-04-21 00:36:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll hopefully have a job lined up and being coasting by this point.
2014-04-21 00:36:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you'll pay for my flight to Cali? Haha :)
2014-04-21 00:37:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha if I've got an engineering job lined up no doubt!
2014-04-21 00:38:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean... when I've got my engineering job lined up
2014-04-21 00:39:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even if you had $$$ it's still probably be hard for me to let you pay for things haha. Just how u was raised I guess
2014-04-21 00:39:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*how I
2014-04-21 00:40:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well hopefully you get over that if I do get a nice paying job
2014-04-21 00:40:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ain't no point in having money if I can't spend it
2014-04-21 00:40:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh baby oh baby
2014-04-21 00:40:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, you're goofy
2014-04-21 00:41:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and lol at that sentence
2014-04-21 00:41:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]" Even if you had $$$ it's still probably be hard for me to let you pay for things haha. Just how u was raised I guess"
2014-04-21 00:42:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cavewoman speech over here
2014-04-21 00:43:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cave woman in respect tony grammar?
2014-04-21 00:43:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-04-21 00:44:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*to my
2014-04-21 00:44:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]combination of typos and grammar
2014-04-21 00:47:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our texting grammar incompatibility may be our downfall :,(
2014-04-21 00:48:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha are we incompatible in that regard?
2014-04-21 00:49:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You seem to be very particular about it, while I don't care about it nearly as much while texting 
2014-04-21 00:50:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I don't enforce it on you.
2014-04-21 00:50:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sentence just sounded funny to read.
2014-04-21 00:55:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm calling it a night.
2014-04-21 00:55:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright, me too. 
2014-04-21 00:56:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight darling
2014-04-21 00:56:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet dreams :)
2014-04-21 01:00:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lemme just say again real quick how handsome you are. On top of innumerable other amazing qualities :)  
2014-04-21 01:01:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, thanks. What prompted that?
2014-04-21 01:02:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Just looking at that picture you sent
2014-04-21 01:04:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well thanks. I'm glad you seem to be enjoying my aesthetics as much as I enjoy yours.
2014-04-21 01:06:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just can't wait to see you.
2014-04-21 01:06:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So soon. 
2014-04-21 01:07:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) goodnight, beautiful
2014-04-21 01:08:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like using "beautiful" because I think it describes how I see you physically and spiritually
2014-04-21 01:08:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I think that's enough sappiness for the night ;)
2014-04-21 01:09:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I have a whole pool of sappiness for ya, but I'll save it. Sleep right 
2014-04-21 01:09:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*tight
2014-04-21 09:48:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good morning, hon. I hope your grant meeting is going well. Kick ass today    😃 
2014-04-21 10:44:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So far so good I think 
2014-04-21 11:24:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was fake Daft Punk playing with Arcade Fire
2014-04-21 11:27:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol what? That's so weird.

2014-04-21 13:36:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like time has slowed down for me, haha. I'm like a little kid at Christmastime.
2014-04-21 13:37:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah I'm almost glad I have so much to do, should distract me :)
2014-04-21 16:37:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh eff yeah... a back porch with trees! 
2014-04-21 16:51:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is this your place in NC?
2014-04-21 16:51:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah
2014-04-21 16:54:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's so awesome. How much is it a month?
2014-04-21 16:54:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$400 before utilities
2014-04-21 16:54:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he's prorating my rent for May and August
2014-04-21 16:54:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so $150 for May
2014-04-21 16:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and probably $100 or so for August
2014-04-21 21:05:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a pretty good deal. 
2014-04-21 21:05:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am pretty tired of oysters at the moment 
2014-04-21 21:05:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty pretty pretty
2014-04-21 21:12:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-04-21 21:12:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm making some Hamburger Helper
2014-04-21 21:12:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nom nom nom
2014-04-21 21:12:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm on the bus

2014-04-21 21:13:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was the day?
2014-04-21 21:14:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Long, and spanning from feeling really optimistic to wanting to give up science haha
2014-04-21 21:15:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, haha. Welcome to grad school!
2014-04-21 21:15:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-04-21 21:16:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still have like 4+ hours of reading to do before 1p tomorrow but I'm just gonna get up early to do it. My brain is rebelling
2014-04-21 21:17:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Damn, that's a lot.
2014-04-21 21:17:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I know the feeling.
2014-04-21 21:17:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Speciation is a little ridiculous
2014-04-21 21:17:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Educational at least?
2014-04-21 21:18:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, it's a lot if literature and theory I need to know
2014-04-21 21:18:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's good
2014-04-21 21:18:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What'd you do today?
2014-04-21 21:18:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that person never got back to me about those tickets and the post is down    😞 
2014-04-21 21:19:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aw that's ok.
2014-04-21 21:19:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We can go to that other show if you want.
2014-04-21 21:19:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was really excited about that, though!
2014-04-21 21:21:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure I'll get another chance to see both of them
2014-04-21 21:21:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we can still go to that thing in the park 
2014-04-21 21:22:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, ok
2014-04-21 21:25:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So there's a chance I might not get this place in Raleigh now
2014-04-21 21:27:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh
2014-04-21 21:28:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I'll be a little pissed if I don't.
2014-04-21 21:28:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He said he's gonna send me a sublease and everything, but that he and his roommate are looking for a group of two people to move in together.
2014-04-21 21:29:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And he said if that happens I don't get the place.
2014-04-21 21:29:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He said I should know by Wednesday.
2014-04-21 21:29:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are there other internship ppl?
2014-04-21 21:29:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Butttt that's pretty bullshit.
2014-04-21 21:29:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, but I don't have any contact info.
2014-04-21 21:29:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably a little late to try to find a roommate.
2014-04-21 21:30:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah. I guess even if they pull out Wednesday you still have time
2014-04-21 21:30:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, there are a ton of people subletting there for the summer too since it's a college town
2014-04-21 21:30:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'll find something
2014-04-21 21:31:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that one seemed like a perfect fit
2014-04-21 21:31:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I was looking forward to one less thing hanging over my head
2014-04-21 21:39:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fingers crossed it works out
2014-04-21 21:40:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks. You feeling okay?
2014-04-21 21:42:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah sorry I'm just a little zonked. 13 hour days is at least 2 hours too long in my book
2014-04-21 21:42:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No worries. And I agree. You should definitely relax.
2014-04-21 21:47:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't forget about our trading massages agreement :)
2014-04-21 21:47:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds good.
2014-04-21 21:47:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What beer was that
2014-04-21 21:47:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I made out India Pale Ale
2014-04-21 21:47:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Brooklyn Pale Ale
2014-04-21 21:48:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh it wasn't an IPA?
2014-04-21 21:48:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One of my favorite standard breweries. 
2014-04-21 21:48:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah it's an IPA
2014-04-21 21:48:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And East IPA haha

2014-04-21 21:54:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]< 48 hours
2014-04-21 21:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably not gonna be my best < 48 hours
2014-04-21 21:56:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ants in your pantsy?
2014-04-21 21:57:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've got some school shiz to work on
2014-04-21 21:57:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Preach. I have to get on the bus at 6:45a on Wednesday.
2014-04-21 21:58:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gross
2014-04-21 21:58:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm honestly gonna have my mommy call me to make sure I'm up
2014-04-21 21:58:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha probably a good idea
2014-04-21 21:59:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you doing?
2014-04-21 22:00:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sitting on my couch giggling about SnapChats. Wanna video?
2014-04-21 22:00:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I'm eating, though. Will that gross you out
2014-04-21 22:01:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of course not. Lemme put on some semblance of clothing though
2014-04-21 22:01:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]noooooooo
2014-04-21 23:42:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh! I forgot to tell you. I'm not even close to being done with Lolita.
2014-04-21 23:42:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not even half way yet.
2014-04-21 23:43:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had illegally downloaded an epub version that apparently didn't have the whole book
2014-04-21 23:43:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but now I've got the full version
2014-04-21 23:43:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I"m still in part 1
2014-04-21 23:45:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]shit just got real, though
2014-04-21 23:45:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the mom just got hit by a car
2014-04-21 23:45:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, you are in for some craziness
2014-04-21 23:46:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm liking it quite a bit so far.
2014-04-21 23:47:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're making me want to reread it
2014-04-21 23:48:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what did you say you were watching?
2014-04-21 23:49:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dollhouse
2014-04-21 23:49:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word... well I'm gonna try to fall asleep. Sweet dreams. Try to plow through tomorrow!
2014-04-21 23:51:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good night, and thank you! I just need to not imagine lying on your chest too much and I'll make it :)
2014-04-21 23:55:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't handle it!!!!
2014-04-21 23:56:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘
2014-04-22 08:48:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's make a pizza 
2014-04-22 08:53:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would love that
2014-04-22 08:54:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My half can have lots of exciting tasty things on it and yours can be just pepperoni ;)
2014-04-22 08:57:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha perfect.
2014-04-22 10:16:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Discussing your dudes in class today!
2014-04-22 10:21:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Heck yeah! Plethodontids are where it's at.
2014-04-22 11:52:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't tell people here you're coming, let's surprise them at breakfast on Sunday. Unless you think that's a silly idea
2014-04-22 11:53:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, nah I'm down with that
2014-04-22 11:53:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that could be funny
2014-04-22 11:53:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just saw Tim and told him to come because I'll have a surprise for him 
2014-04-22 11:54:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I told Haley you were driving with me but she was drunk and I'm pretty sure forgot haha
2014-04-22 11:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word, yeah that'd be fun
2014-04-22 11:54:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how's the reading coming along?
2014-04-22 11:55:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, I'm getting close to frantic skimming but I should make it. I also had to stop by Ace hardware to get spare keys for Darcy
2014-04-22 11:57:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you got this!
2014-04-22 11:58:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-04-22 17:22:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just filled in my brother-from-another-mother about you
2014-04-22 17:22:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was fun
2014-04-22 17:25:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like the situation gets a little less ridiculous sounding everyday 
2014-04-22 17:25:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha what do you mean?
2014-04-22 17:26:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean compared to explaining it to people even a couple weeks ago
2014-04-22 17:26:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you think?
2014-04-22 17:26:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the beginning is still kind of bonkers.
2014-04-22 17:27:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-04-22 17:27:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I've gotten more comfortable with it
2014-04-22 17:27:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh for sure
2014-04-22 17:27:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I definitely don't think we're being crazy
2014-04-22 17:27:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even though it might seem that way from an outsider's perspective
2014-04-22 17:28:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The window for "temporary insanity" has passed haha
2014-04-22 17:29:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha for sure
2014-04-22 17:30:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would you be down with picking me up from campus tomorrow?
2014-04-22 17:33:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would be an honor 
2014-04-22 17:33:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm thinking I'll be getting in closer to 5:45 with traffic though
2014-04-22 17:33:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright, I'll probably head back to my apartment before then
2014-04-22 21:04:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll text you before I leave and let you know my eta
2014-04-22 21:04:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had such a nice night after ethics with my cohort!
2014-04-22 21:05:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-04-22 21:05:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's awesome!
2014-04-22 21:05:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just good convo or what?
2014-04-22 21:30:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My cohort has very rarely hung out as a group, so that was nice
2014-04-22 21:31:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And otherwise just chatted 
2014-04-22 21:31:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-04-22 21:33:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I'm gonna be able to sleep tonight 
2014-04-22 21:34:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]excited?
2014-04-22 21:36:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very
2014-04-22 21:37:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw
2014-04-22 21:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I always have a hard time falling asleep when I have an early flight for some reason
2014-04-22 21:37:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's just the pressure to fall asleep
2014-04-22 21:38:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I'll probably take a melatonin to help at least a little bit 
2014-04-22 21:38:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]worrrddd
2014-04-22 21:38:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you gettin packed?
2014-04-22 21:38:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup!
2014-04-22 21:39:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Warm weather clothes, a swim suit, comfy clothes for driving, sexy panties
2014-04-22 21:40:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Flip flops
2014-04-22 21:40:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oooh I get some sexy panties, huh?
2014-04-22 21:53:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only the best for my bay
2014-04-22 22:04:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I've noticed you use "baby" or a variant a couple of times. I can't remember exactly what your issues were with it, something like it seemed like it was treating the woman like a child? I guess you don't feel that way when its used on guys?
2014-04-22 22:05:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This mightttt be the 2nd variant I've ever used. But I guess I use it more in a joking/colloquial sense than as a specific identifier for you
2014-04-22 22:06:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I probably wouldn't mind you using it as such, but I'm sure I wouldn't like it being commonly used
2014-04-22 22:07:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-04-22 22:07:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had noticed it was exclusively a joking context
2014-04-22 22:07:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I still thought it was odd
2014-04-22 22:08:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not necessarily "woman as a child" 
2014-04-22 22:08:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just anyone as a child
2014-04-22 22:09:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But there still is a pop culture association and such which I acknowledge and sometimes incorporates itself 
2014-04-23 05:03:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!!
2014-04-23 07:10:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Holy shit you're up early. I'm so excited, though!
2014-04-23 07:11:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I wanted to sleep until 5:30 but the cat had other ideas
2014-04-23 08:18:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where I got my lil happy butt-wiggle
2014-04-23 08:19:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha awww
2014-04-23 08:19:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]About to take off?
2014-04-23 08:23:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I hope you're all curled up in a ball and able to get a nap. I can't wait to see you.
2014-04-23 11:30:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In Texas!
2014-04-23 11:31:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yessss
2014-04-23 11:31:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna be a sleepy Katie tonight for sure
2014-04-23 11:32:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I had a feeling. That's cool, though. I woke up really early so I should be tired too.
2014-04-23 12:39:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you here yet? Are you here yet? Are you here yet?
2014-04-23 13:39:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Look outside :)
2014-04-23 13:42:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just kidding, but I am on the road!
2014-04-23 13:42:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet
2014-04-23 13:43:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You still thinking 5:45? Send me a message or call when you're about half an hour away.
2014-04-23 13:44:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hopefully around then. I'll call you, and if you're still on campus for some reason I can pick you up
2014-04-23 13:45:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds good. See you soonish 🙌
2014-04-23 13:46:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Throwing up the []_[] I like it
2014-04-23 17:05:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hit really bad traffic coming out of Houston so closer to 6:15
2014-04-23 17:10:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😭
2014-04-23 17:10:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just kidding. I'll see you then.
2014-04-23 18:02:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're close!
2014-04-25 13:21:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You make me so effing happy!
2014-04-25 15:10:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-04-25 15:19:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Twisted root (burger/milkshake place) or Avila's (tex mex)?
2014-04-25 16:19:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had a burger for lunch, but I could still do either.
2014-04-25 16:21:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Avila's 
2014-04-25 16:22:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Carl said he could meet us 7-7:30
2014-04-25 16:45:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can you bring my camera when you head this way?
2014-04-25 16:45:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup. Should I leave around 5:15 do you think?
2014-04-25 16:46:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's whenever you want!
2014-04-25 17:27:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Leaving now!
2014-04-25 17:28:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yessss!
2014-04-25 17:57:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]10 min
2014-04-25 17:58:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-04-25 18:14:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Almost there.....
2014-04-25 18:14:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha ok.
2014-04-27 18:53:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hope you're getting on the plane with no trouble. Everything about the past 4 days was perfect, even just getting to do mundane things like shopping with you. I can't imagine that I'll sleep nearly as well tonight without you by my side, but I'm sure the next 2 weeks will fly by.
2014-04-27 21:31:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Holy shit that was a bumpy flight.
2014-04-27 21:45:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh, didya yak?
2014-04-27 21:47:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha no. A little bit of an adrenaline rush, though.
2014-04-27 22:05:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tiny seats too, right?
2014-04-27 22:49:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I tried sending you a snap, but it wasn't working. Miss you already! https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-BbiY-GbYkyk/U13P42IlMHI/AAAAAAAAT0M/PhAviUvEwbA/s0/2014-04-27
2014-04-28 01:39:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Climbing in bed, hoping all the ecstatically happy vibes seeping out of it will grant me good dreams
2014-04-28 01:40:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miss you, good night my dear
2014-04-28 10:07:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]this picture:  https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=1368002932399&set=a.1368002652392.49325.1601479298&type=3&theater
2014-04-28 10:07:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha pretty cute kid, huh?
2014-04-28 10:08:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was the cat that I told you died when I was on spring break my freshman year of college and I cried, haha.
2014-04-28 10:09:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Awww
2014-04-28 10:09:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]a very cute kid (and so many kitties!)
2014-04-28 10:13:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]also you're birthday is the day before my moms
2014-04-28 10:13:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no kidding
2014-04-28 10:13:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that'll make it easy for you to remember!
2014-04-28 10:14:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]possibly...
2014-04-28 20:23:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's it going?
2014-04-28 20:23:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Bad!
2014-04-28 20:23:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]j/k
2014-04-28 20:23:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do miss you a lot, though
2014-04-28 20:23:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how are you doing?
2014-04-28 20:24:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A little stressed, but making some progress 
2014-04-28 20:24:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's stressing you out?
2014-04-28 20:24:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This Hinds find
2014-04-28 20:24:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*fund
2014-04-28 20:25:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when's the deadline?
2014-04-28 20:25:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Friday
2014-04-28 20:25:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm leaving for the MBL early Friday morning so I have to get it done by Thursday 
2014-04-28 20:26:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man. Yeah, I guess it's crunch-time.
2014-04-28 20:26:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How long does the proposal have to be?
2014-04-28 20:26:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's not how you're supposed to phrase that for research grants
2014-04-28 20:26:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-28 20:26:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how many pages are you allowed?
2014-04-28 20:29:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]5 single spaced
2014-04-28 20:29:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But since I'm still figuring out what the hell I'm even going to do its tricky
2014-04-28 20:29:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, you're probably not using any of your GRFP, right?
2014-04-28 20:30:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No butterflyfish haha
2014-04-28 20:31:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I have to make a detailed budget
2014-04-28 20:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I guess you've got your work cut out for you.
2014-04-28 20:31:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it has to be an amazing proposal for the Hinds.
2014-04-28 20:32:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's mostly designed as proposal writing practice
2014-04-28 20:32:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you still want it to be good obviously
2014-04-28 20:34:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah yeah I know. I'm just not good at doing work I know is mediocre
2014-04-28 20:34:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, not a bad thing.
2014-04-28 20:35:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's your work coming along?
2014-04-28 20:36:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fine. I'm about to finish up writing this project report for computer architecture.
2014-04-28 20:36:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I re-read the spec for my stats for ML project and it's actually more straightforward than I originally thought.
2014-04-28 20:36:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's good
2014-04-28 20:36:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I've just got two exams and that project left basically
2014-04-28 20:37:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]most of the stress at this point is gonna come from moving I think
2014-04-28 20:38:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking today about how I wish we could spend some normal days together
2014-04-28 20:38:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's kind of stating the obviosu
2014-04-28 20:40:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'd like to be able to sleep in the same bed as you've had a long day of work... help de-stress you a bit
2014-04-28 20:40:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess it wouldn't be a long distance relationship if we had that going
2014-04-28 20:40:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-28 20:57:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry the oysters sucked me back in!
2014-04-28 20:57:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no worries, I'm glad!
2014-04-28 20:59:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I obviously agree. The emotional/passionate weekends after weeks of not seeing each other I'm sure will always be great, but it might take a while to establish a feeling of 'normalcy'
2014-04-28 21:00:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I know if I had you to go home to tonight I'd be in an infinitely better mood haha
2014-04-28 21:02:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]  😃  and    😞  
2014-04-28 21:04:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I talked to my friend Elin today
2014-04-28 21:06:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's driving home from Montana, finally leaving that psychopath 
2014-04-28 21:07:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's good. Is she ok?
2014-04-28 21:13:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think she will be, we talked for like 2 hours about everything. I guess he had been keeping her from having friends up there and stuff. She's hopefully gonna come to Costa Rica too though!
2014-04-28 21:15:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's pretty messed up. Sounds like leaving him was a good idea. But that'd be exciting if she made it to Costa Rica. Probably be good for her to get some quality time in with you too.
2014-04-28 21:37:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I hope so
2014-04-28 21:38:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I also got to finally explain to her who that "gentleman friend" was in my apt the last time she called :)
2014-04-28 21:38:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-04-28 21:39:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]although I kinda like the mystery of being called the "gentleman friend"
2014-04-28 21:40:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well now you've been demoted to "possibly the most amazing man I've ever met"
2014-04-28 21:42:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha man are you gonna be disappointed someday
2014-04-28 21:43:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You secretly do hate cats, don't you?
2014-04-28 21:43:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I knew it
2014-04-28 21:43:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, that's your deal breaker?
2014-04-28 21:48:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would add some tension at least
2014-04-28 21:52:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hope my previous comment isn't putting undue expectations on you
2014-04-28 21:54:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah I've picked up on how you feel about me... but I guess it might not have been that explicit, haha
2014-04-28 21:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still is kinda weird to think about why you feel that way
2014-04-28 21:54:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it makes me really happy that you're that into me
2014-04-28 21:54:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I get to just be myself
2014-04-28 21:55:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I have an equally high opinion of you
2014-04-28 21:55:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so at least the pressure's on both of us
2014-04-28 21:55:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-28 21:58:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's good haha, I guess it could be kind of awkward if things were lopsided
2014-04-28 21:59:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt. Tim brought up this concept of "power" or something in a relationship, which was interesting
2014-04-28 21:59:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was like the relationship is a zero-sum game
2014-04-28 22:00:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so one person is always more invested
2014-04-28 22:00:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or has more to lose or something like that
2014-04-28 22:00:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's not necessarily zero-sum
2014-04-28 22:00:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I believe that too
2014-04-28 22:01:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that things can shift over a course of the relationship 
2014-04-28 22:01:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But the balance doesn't always have to be that much out of whack 
2014-04-28 22:03:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right, I guess the constant imbalance is interesting to me
2014-04-28 22:07:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well it's hard to ever trulyy know how invested someone else is maybe, so people can out of insecurity detect an imbalance where there isn't really one. Or there's the interesting predilection in a lot of people to enjoy the chase more than the end result. 
2014-04-28 22:10:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you thinking about how the balance in our relationship now too? haha
2014-04-28 22:10:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm j/k. I wouldn't actually want to know.
2014-04-28 22:11:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't be in a relationship if I didn't think it was either balanced or me being the one with more to lose/more invested
2014-04-28 22:14:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's good to know. I guess I'm a bit cautious in general about ending up in the latter situation.
2014-04-28 22:15:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm not worried about that now :)
2014-04-28 22:21:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]3 more days and...
2014-04-28 22:22:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-04-28 22:22:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]look at that hair, man
2014-04-28 22:23:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ew
2014-04-28 22:23:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you have a favorit N*SYNC dude?
2014-04-28 22:23:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lance
2014-04-28 22:23:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-04-28 22:23:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obvs
2014-04-28 22:35:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Home, and realizing I got kinda jipped on the back massage! (though I guess you did too haha)
2014-04-28 22:36:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah, I was kinda waiting for you to ask for one
2014-04-28 22:36:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I tried to give you some back rubs at times
2014-04-28 22:36:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I know and I loved them
2014-04-28 22:37:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'll make sure that's taken care of in a couple of weeks
2014-04-28 22:37:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just want backrubs ALL the time
2014-04-28 22:37:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Insatiable
2014-04-28 22:38:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, I'll give you backrubs all day if it means you laying on me and nuzzling me
2014-04-28 22:39:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So much smiling going on right now haha
2014-04-28 22:40:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh and after thinking some more, if it's ok with you I'll just see you when you get in to Chicago on Tuesday. I'm probably going to be putting off packing until the last minute and want to get most of it done before you get here 
2014-04-28 22:40:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also I don't want to miss a couple proposal talks
2014-04-28 22:41:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, no worries
2014-04-28 22:41:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll probably stop before St. Louis then.
2014-04-28 22:43:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah that makes sense. 
2014-04-28 22:43:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also there's a surprise party for Tim that weekend involving Legos 
2014-04-28 22:43:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jon is already getting the planning started
2014-04-28 22:43:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha awesome
2014-04-28 22:44:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a group of us did a guerilla lego building session in his apartment once while he was out of town
2014-04-28 22:44:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Does he have a lot of Legos?
2014-04-28 22:45:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yes
2014-04-28 22:47:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] The theme of the party makes more sense now
2014-04-28 22:47:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you thought he just randomly wanted it to be Lego themed?
2014-04-28 22:48:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean it would surprise me if Tim was into Legos, but I thought it meant Jon was gonna go out and buy a bunch. Which would be expensive as he'll
2014-04-28 22:48:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*hell
2014-04-28 22:49:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*wouldnt 
2014-04-28 22:49:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh
2014-04-28 22:52:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright, I think I'm gonna crash and get up early to work
2014-04-28 22:53:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooook
2014-04-28 22:53:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight, wish you were here
2014-04-28 22:54:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet dreams, beautiful
2014-04-28 22:54:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're amazing
2014-04-29 08:02:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good morning, sugar. Do work today... remember that you're a scientist and that's completely rad!
2014-04-29 08:02:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A putative scientist at best, but thank you!
2014-04-29 12:07:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you going to offer your place to stay for any ppl going to evolution?
2014-04-29 12:07:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe. I need to talk to my roommates about it, who I won't meet until I move in.
2014-04-29 12:08:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt I'll be able to put everybody up.
2014-04-29 12:09:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are people looking into hotels?
2014-04-29 12:10:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I dont think anyone is expecting you to necessarily, I was just wondering if you were thinking about it
2014-04-29 12:10:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess I could put a couple people up best case scenario and then everyone could split hotel costs or something?
2014-04-29 12:11:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't want to play favorites
2014-04-29 12:13:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Understandable. I don't know if anyone is planning a big hotel split yet but I'm sure Aaron will get on something.
2014-04-29 12:14:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What dates are y'all gonna be there?
2014-04-29 12:19:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably getting in like 7pm on Friday 6/20 and leaving morning of the 26th
2014-04-29 12:19:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-04-29 12:19:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]6 nights!
2014-04-29 12:20:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yesss    😃 
2014-04-29 12:21:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna need it after a full month gap
2014-04-29 12:22:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're going up incrementally. 3 nights->2 nights-> 4 nights-> 5 nights ->6
2014-04-29 12:23:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess it'll continue into August even
2014-04-29 12:23:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]July might be an outlier
2014-04-29 12:32:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah :/  If the proposal I'm writing is at all likely, then I'll be on the west coast from like July 5-July 30
2014-04-29 12:32:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might actually go to San Diego though haha 
2014-04-29 12:36:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, so that'd be a pretty big gap
2014-04-29 12:36:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]June 26 to August 9 I guess?
2014-04-29 12:37:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gross
2014-04-29 12:39:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Would you be doing research in San Diego or what?
2014-04-29 12:52:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very gross, but right around the 6 week maximum with a long visit to look forward to :)
2014-04-29 12:52:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There are oysters in San Diego
2014-04-29 12:52:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm gonna kill em
2014-04-29 12:55:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. Will you have any free time?
2014-04-29 12:57:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe. If I do I'll obviously say hi to your parentals 
2014-04-29 12:57:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna borrow Daniels car and just drive up and down the coast haha
2014-04-29 13:01:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant more will you have enough free time to justify me heading out to San Diego for a weekend.
2014-04-29 13:24:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhh. Well I could definitely make time, but $500 for just a weekend seems silly
2014-04-29 13:28:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm ok
2014-04-29 13:30:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My plans are still too up in the air about all of that too. We can make 6 weeks! Plus you'll probably be busily distracted with work and shooting up Raleigh heroin haha
2014-04-29 13:32:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. It'll be good. I guess I'm just not really into long distance haha
2014-04-29 13:33:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'm not either, but I guess that's the situation at present
2014-04-29 13:34:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Truth.
2014-04-29 14:24:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry that was kinda snappy
2014-04-29 19:42:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That shirt is awesome
2014-04-29 20:20:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, thanks. It's a limited edition too.
2014-04-29 20:20:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got it from this site called teefury.com
2014-04-29 20:21:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.teefury.com/about.php
2014-04-29 20:37:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh how clever, if you really like a shirt you have to buy it that day
2014-04-29 20:37:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeppp. How was ethics?
2014-04-29 20:39:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok. Talked about publications and science/culture(HeLa cells). Some decently stimulating discussion and some standard obnoxiousness 
2014-04-29 20:39:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Settling in for a night at the desk now
2014-04-29 20:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. My database prof dropped another HW assignment on us today so I'm working on that.
2014-04-29 20:40:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]kinda annoying
2014-04-29 20:41:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The concept of homework almost sounds worse than the stuff I have to do
2014-04-29 20:42:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah it's pretty obnoxious... but I'm pretty opposed to most traditional forms of assessment
2014-04-29 20:43:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True that
2014-04-29 20:44:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright, I'm gonna pull an Alcorn and try to self impose a communication ban until I've made some decent progress on this ish
2014-04-29 20:44:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, sounds wise.
2014-04-29 20:45:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably be good for me too.
2014-04-29 20:45:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Think hard!
2014-04-29 20:45:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you yo
2014-04-29 20:45:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You kept popping in my head today
2014-04-29 20:46:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very distracting...
2014-04-29 20:47:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, that's an everyday occurrence for me
2014-04-29 20:47:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:) I'll talk to you later
2014-04-29 20:47:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘   
2014-04-30 00:26:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone looks like they're about to crash
2014-04-30 00:26:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-04-30 00:26:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah. I've had enough of databases
2014-04-30 00:26:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How's the writing coming along?
2014-04-30 00:28:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not terrible, and at times almost flowing. I think I actually have a pretty decent idea (and one I'm interested in)
2014-04-30 00:29:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well that sounds pretty positive. Glad to hear it.
2014-04-30 00:30:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll send you a draft tomorrow if you want, I'd love your feedback
2014-04-30 00:30:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though it's probably a pretty boring read haha
2014-04-30 00:31:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah, I'd like that, but I might not have time tomorrow because my first final is Thursday.
2014-04-30 00:33:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But, with that being said, I think I'm gonna call it a night so I can get up and start studying tomorrow.
2014-04-30 00:34:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright. Goodnight handsome 
2014-04-30 00:34:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've been having this desire to tell you how great you are.
2014-04-30 00:34:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We should set aside some time while I'm in Chicago.
2014-04-30 00:35:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it doesn't really have to be set aside haha
2014-04-30 00:35:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You tell me that everyday! 
2014-04-30 00:35:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which is pretty great
2014-04-30 00:35:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll just need to remember.
2014-04-30 00:36:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to be more detailed, though.
2014-04-30 00:36:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There are a ton of little things about you that make me really happy and into you.
2014-04-30 00:37:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Anyway I'm rambling. Haha
2014-04-30 00:37:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm having an existential crisis.
2014-04-30 00:38:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those are reserved for me only
2014-04-30 00:38:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you can always ramble when it's about something that's making me smile this much 
2014-04-30 00:39:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well that's good to know.
2014-04-30 00:40:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go to sleep, and have lots of dreams about nuzzling
2014-04-30 00:40:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) that'd be nice.
2014-04-30 00:41:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Keep up the good work! Goodnight, beautiful.
2014-04-30 13:31:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey, sugar. Hope you're having a good day.
2014-04-30 15:41:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey suga daddy. It's been one spent staring way too much at the computer, but I'm almost done!
2014-04-30 15:41:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hope the studying is going well
2014-04-30 21:14:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't even see that first message until now.
2014-04-30 21:15:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I look at your Facebook profile picture in full size at least once a day because I like knowing that you were looking at me in it.
2014-04-30 21:16:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think the same thing every time I see that picture. It's probably why I like it so much, I know I'm genuinely super happy in it
2014-04-30 21:16:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awww, melting my heart
2014-04-30 21:18:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to be done with my paper in 15 minutes 
2014-04-30 21:18:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So hold on a sec
2014-04-30 21:19:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't go anywhere!
2014-04-30 21:19:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok!
2014-04-30 22:03:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok I was off by a factor of 3, but now it really is (mostly) done
2014-04-30 22:03:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I knew there was no way when you said 15
2014-04-30 22:03:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Formatting -_-
2014-04-30 22:06:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also lol at me saying "almost done" at 3:41
2014-04-30 22:06:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha yeah I noticed that
2014-04-30 22:06:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I ended up writing too much intro and detailed methods
2014-04-30 22:07:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Without having written the important "hypothesis" paragraph
2014-04-30 22:07:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sooo length wise I was totally close 7 hours ago haha
2014-04-30 22:07:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I dig
2014-04-30 22:07:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hypotheses are important I guess
2014-04-30 22:13:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meh
2014-04-30 22:14:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's your work going?
2014-04-30 22:17:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sucks
2014-04-30 22:17:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hate my life
2014-04-30 22:17:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-30 22:17:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not really
2014-04-30 22:17:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I legitimately hate my schooling, though
2014-04-30 22:18:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Real world work probably has bullshit to deal with too
2014-04-30 22:18:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess then you're at least getting paid 
2014-04-30 22:18:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah that's important
2014-04-30 22:19:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I can't think of any real world bullshit that could be as trivial as grades
2014-04-30 22:19:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Boss assessment
2014-04-30 22:20:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Elaborate progress sheets to prove you are valuable and shouldn't be fired? 
2014-04-30 22:21:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha hmm I'm hoping I'm not in a situation where I'll be dealing with that
2014-04-30 22:21:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my contributions should be fairly obvious if I get an engineering or data science job
2014-04-30 22:24:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/big-data-analytics/data-scientists-can-find-big-money-in-open-source/
2014-04-30 22:25:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what I'm shooting for
2014-04-30 22:25:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How does being self employed and working with open source software make you money? 
2014-04-30 22:26:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-04-30 22:27:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So like this article talks about self employed data scientists:  http://www.kdnuggets.com/2013/02/salary-analytics
2014-04-30 22:28:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]didn't work for me
2014-04-30 22:28:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's because I didn't c/p all of it, duhh
2014-04-30 22:28:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.kdnuggets.com/2013/02/salary-analytics-data-mining-data-science-professionals.html
2014-04-30 22:30:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm still not sure what you're asking, haha
2014-04-30 22:30:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]these people have expertise in data analysis
2014-04-30 22:31:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm what does one do as a self employed person with expertise. Consult?
2014-04-30 22:31:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I guess so
2014-04-30 22:32:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]say I'll analyze your data for you
2014-04-30 22:32:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure how you'd get in that kind of position, though
2014-04-30 22:32:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'd have to establish a reputation somehow
2014-04-30 22:34:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Build your code rep
2014-04-30 22:35:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not really code for data analysis, though
2014-04-30 22:35:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'd need to prove that you had made some people more money basically
2014-04-30 22:35:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but how would you get those initial clients?
2014-04-30 22:35:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or improved their product somehow
2014-04-30 22:37:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds boring 
2014-04-30 22:38:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that's coming for something that spent most of last night thinking about how oysters make baby oysters 
2014-04-30 22:38:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-04-30 22:38:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What? 
2014-04-30 22:38:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a joke
2014-04-30 22:48:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Merr I'm sorry I insulted your intended career path. That's pretty shitty, even as a joke
2014-04-30 22:49:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't like it if you said something like that to me 
2014-04-30 22:49:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no worries. Just caught me off guard.
2014-04-30 22:49:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]didn't really seem like you.
2014-04-30 22:51:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'm pretty blegh from working 
2014-04-30 22:51:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might just go to bed soon
2014-04-30 22:53:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah writing can take a lot out of you
2014-04-30 23:32:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah
2014-04-30 23:34:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-04-30 23:35:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hannah is taking the couch and chair tomorrow
2014-04-30 23:36:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where will you sit when you watch tv?? 
2014-04-30 23:36:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is that going to be awkward for you?
2014-04-30 23:37:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah
2014-04-30 23:37:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking it might be the last time I ever see here, though
2014-04-30 23:37:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is kinda weird to think about
2014-04-30 23:37:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is she moving from Dallas?
2014-04-30 23:38:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah she's going to Texas State in the fall
2014-04-30 23:38:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you guys don't think you'll be friends in the future?
2014-04-30 23:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah, I'm not friends with any of my exes
2014-04-30 23:39:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sounds kinda bitter I guess
2014-04-30 23:40:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I disconnect from my exes
2014-04-30 23:40:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah I guess it's just a fact
2014-04-30 23:45:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not going to be like a dramatic/passionate/never gonna see each other again thing? 
2014-04-30 23:45:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's sounds stupid just saying it
2014-04-30 23:45:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no
2014-04-30 23:50:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you make me feel more passionate than I ever have!
2014-04-30 23:51:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely ditto for me 
2014-04-30 23:53:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh I'm such in a funk 
2014-04-30 23:53:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😞 
2014-04-30 23:53:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just exhaustedd?
2014-04-30 23:56:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mostly , I didn't sleep a lot last night and have eaten like nothing today
2014-04-30 23:56:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But tomorrow will be a new day!
2014-04-30 23:56:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yes indeed
2014-04-30 23:56:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure some rest will bring you out of it
2014-04-30 23:57:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your flight is Saturday?
2014-04-30 23:58:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah

2014-04-30 23:59:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-04-30 23:59:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How long is that flight?
2014-05-01 00:00:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]three hours
2014-05-01 00:01:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're both going to be off radar this weekend 
2014-05-01 00:02:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more you than me
2014-05-01 00:02:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yeah, I wasn't expecting to talk to you much
2014-05-01 00:02:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Video chat tomorrow?

2014-05-01 00:03:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My phone had scrolled up and I thought you replied "3 hours" haha
2014-05-01 00:04:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not that I'd be opposed to that at all
2014-05-01 00:04:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, we've done it before!
2014-05-01 00:04:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right?
2014-05-01 00:04:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was around that

2014-05-01 00:06:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Boys are killin it
2014-05-01 00:07:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? I haven't been following that series.

2014-05-01 00:08:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You never know
2014-05-01 00:10:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm gonna go to sleep so I'm rested for this final.
2014-05-01 00:11:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm drifting too. Good luck, I'm sure you'll kill it. Sorry again about that silly comment
2014-05-01 00:11:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't wait to see your face tomorrow
2014-05-01 00:12:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃

2014-05-01 10:30:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol, perfect response. How are you feeling today?
2014-05-01 10:31:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sleepy 
2014-05-01 10:31:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Staying in bed until I get notes back from Cathy 
2014-05-01 10:31:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How are you?
2014-05-01 10:33:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like a plan. I'm alright. Feel good about one class being done. I just saw the Google Maps car, so I might be on there in the future haha
2014-05-01 10:38:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ooo I'm dating someone famous?!
2014-05-01 10:39:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I waved like a total nerd.
2014-05-01 10:40:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would too
2014-05-01 10:42:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] I had a dream where you had long hair and were doing these field experiments with horseshoe crabs
2014-05-01 10:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that was me as an undergrad
2014-05-01 10:43:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not doing experiments I guess. But observing them on field trips.
2014-05-01 10:44:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You subconsciously (consciously?) wish I was a biologist still I guess haha
2014-05-01 10:45:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah you were releasing them on the sand and seeing if they accepted a predug hole or how fast they buried into the ground 
2014-05-01 10:45:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha no I don't think so
2014-05-01 10:45:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm pretty ok that you're not, too much biology talk happens in my life already
2014-05-01 10:45:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That does sound like fun!
2014-05-01 10:46:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did not think the hair was that sexy, note
2014-05-01 10:46:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it was also like sun bleached and kinda straight and not like your hair at all haha
2014-05-01 10:47:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha yeah definitely not. That's pretty interesting. Dreams are so weird.
2014-05-01 10:48:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I actually had thought about how I didn't think I would really want to date someone in biology while I was still doing it for exactly that reason.
2014-05-01 10:48:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But now I get biology without the bullshit!
2014-05-01 10:50:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha there still might be some bullshit of a different sort, but I do appreciated that you are at least passingly interested and knowledgeable about what I do 
2014-05-01 10:51:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean of a different sort?
2014-05-01 10:52:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a lame joke, just relationship bs instead of school bs
2014-05-01 10:53:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not that I think our relationship will have any of that haha
2014-05-01 10:56:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. I can't really imagine a scenario where I'd be really upset with you.
2014-05-01 11:14:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hoping I don't disappoint you there :)
2014-05-01 11:15:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't get out of bed
2014-05-01 11:15:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw, wish I was there with you
2014-05-01 11:15:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you definitely wouldn't be getting out of bed then
2014-05-01 11:15:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I also just bought  $130 worth of clothes through my phone
2014-05-01 11:15:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-01 11:15:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whatttt
2014-05-01 11:15:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should not have access to online shopping when I'm procrastinating 
2014-05-01 11:16:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what kind of clothes?
2014-05-01 11:19:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well it all started with a buy 2 get one free bathing suit sale, and then I had to buy enough to get free shipping so also got sandals, a new silky robe, a couple shirts, panties, sunglasses, and a sports bra
2014-05-01 11:19:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, wow
2014-05-01 11:19:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-05-01 11:20:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm officially in the red
2014-05-01 11:20:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh
2014-05-01 11:20:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Credit card bill for April is $479.16
2014-05-01 11:20:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I currently have $233.18  
2014-05-01 11:21:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-01 11:21:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh, well in that case I'm always in the red. I've had $1200 standing debt on my card for years 
2014-05-01 11:22:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will you have enough for gas and stuff this weekend and next?
2014-05-01 11:22:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I can charge it, but I'm going to borrow a significant amount of money from my parents
2014-05-01 11:23:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This is all without health insurance and not owning a car!
2014-05-01 11:23:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's really nice of them
2014-05-01 11:23:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know what society expects from people in my situation.
2014-05-01 11:23:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like what would I do if I didn't have my parents?
2014-05-01 11:23:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You to take out more loans?
2014-05-01 11:24:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Get a part time job?
2014-05-01 11:24:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have a part-time job
2014-05-01 11:24:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Both pretty shitty things
2014-05-01 11:24:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-01 11:24:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yeah I guess I would have to take out more loans
2014-05-01 12:39:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you get a chance to read my proposal? I know you're super busy
2014-05-01 12:46:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I read the first couple of pages last night. I was trying to provide feedback and then I realized I was spending way too much time on it considering I had a final, haha.
2014-05-01 12:54:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No need to give intense feedback haha, especially on little silly things like sentence structure as I'm cleaning that stuff up now. 
2014-05-01 12:57:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that's definitely what was getting most of my attention. Writing style stuff.
2014-05-01 12:57:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I figured
2014-05-01 12:57:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you've never read anything I wrote. Maybe I should've waited for a better draft...
2014-05-01 12:59:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe. I'll read over the final draft on my flight. How about that?
2014-05-01 13:01:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha ok
2014-05-01 13:06:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Was it really that bad?
2014-05-01 13:08:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha no. I wasn't crazy about the intro paragraph mainly.
2014-05-01 13:09:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But that's an important paragraph, so I was trying to think about it a lot.
2014-05-01 13:12:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because of the content? Or the excess of long complex sentences? Too broad?
2014-05-01 13:13:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, a lot of awkward sentences and the sentences didn't really lead into each other.
2014-05-01 13:14:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It felt like independent statements strung together to me.
2014-05-01 13:22:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's fair
2014-05-01 13:55:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh and I forgot I deleted half of the intro to make space. Meeee
2014-05-01 13:55:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*merrr
2014-05-01 13:57:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, oh well. A few tweaks and it'll be good I think.
2014-05-01 15:06:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think my brain has established an association between bacon and you
2014-05-01 15:06:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]particularly sex with you
2014-05-01 15:06:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-01 15:06:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm totally cool with it
2014-05-01 16:31:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know if I should be proud or mildly disturbed 
2014-05-01 16:31:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you eat some of the bacon I left?
2014-05-01 16:31:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No, but it's still in the fridge so I see it everytime I open it.
2014-05-01 16:31:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]every time
2014-05-01 16:50:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like a lot of sexual frustration haha
2014-05-01 16:50:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You working on homework?
2014-05-01 16:50:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah
2014-05-01 16:50:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]should be
2014-05-01 16:50:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-01 16:50:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you writing?
2014-05-01 16:58:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm kinda done
2014-05-01 16:59:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gotta do some resource format bullshit
2014-05-01 16:59:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm going to get some Thai dinner first 
2014-05-01 16:59:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good
2014-05-01 17:03:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wanna read my proposal now?
2014-05-01 17:03:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sure!
2014-05-01 17:06:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sentence connectors!
2014-05-01 17:06:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yay!
2014-05-01 17:06:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-05-01 17:07:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think in and among is redundant
2014-05-01 17:10:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]where do you see that
2014-05-01 17:10:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sentence numero uno
2014-05-01 17:11:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]nooooo its is inter and intra
2014-05-01 17:11:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]inter is between
2014-05-01 17:11:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]among is intra
2014-05-01 17:11:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so in and among say the same thing
2014-05-01 17:17:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]differentiation between populations and differentiation within a single population
2014-05-01 17:17:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]exactly
2014-05-01 17:17:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you use between
2014-05-01 17:17:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok i'll say between and among
2014-05-01 17:17:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hahaha i got it
2014-05-01 17:17:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or within and among
2014-05-01 17:18:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the same thing
2014-05-01 17:18:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no it's not!
2014-05-01 17:18:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/among?r=75&src=ref&ch=dic
2014-05-01 17:27:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that wasn't to discourage you from being critical
2014-05-01 17:28:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i like it'
2014-05-01 17:28:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't get that vibe    😃 
2014-05-01 17:30:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is a new experience for me. having someone I'm in a relationship critique my work
2014-05-01 17:30:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And who's opinion I actually value about it
2014-05-01 17:31:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, I guess I've never done it to someone I'm dating (obviously), but it doesn't feel too different from reading a close friend's paper.
2014-05-01 17:31:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess there's sex on the line this time    😉 
2014-05-01 17:31:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I probably haven't given papers to that many close friends either I guess
2014-05-01 17:32:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. You'll get around to it eventually in the cluster.
2014-05-01 17:32:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]colleagues maybe
2014-05-01 17:32:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]true
2014-05-01 17:32:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, that's who I meant.
2014-05-01 17:32:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The line was very blurred for me.
2014-05-01 17:33:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm getting to that point hopefully 
2014-05-01 17:33:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good    😃 
2014-05-01 17:34:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright darling
2014-05-01 17:34:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm off to eat crab Rangoon
2014-05-01 17:34:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]worddd
2014-05-01 17:36:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]After like 9, video chat? 
2014-05-01 17:36:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sounds good
2014-05-01 21:08:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"focus" is a noun in this case
2014-05-01 21:10:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-05-01 21:10:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a focus in evolutionary biology doesn't make sense, though
2014-05-01 21:10:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least to me it doesn't
2014-05-01 21:11:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's like an aim
2014-05-01 21:11:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]evolutionary biology doesn't aim for things, though
2014-05-01 21:11:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]researchers aim for things
2014-05-01 21:11:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it is an Aim in evolutionary biology
2014-05-01 21:12:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess this is a style thing.
2014-05-01 21:12:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]a goal
2014-05-01 21:12:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A focus in evolutionary biology.
2014-05-01 21:12:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]if I said focus OFevolutionary biology that might be different
2014-05-01 21:12:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*of
2014-05-01 21:12:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They seem the same to me.
2014-05-01 21:13:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe it's a style thing
2014-05-01 21:13:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would you say something like "playing in different modes is a focus in jazz"
2014-05-01 21:14:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would say, "playing in different modes has been a focus of jazz musicians"
2014-05-01 21:15:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would say the first
2014-05-01 21:15:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and the second
2014-05-01 21:16:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you're using the words as a synecdoche
2014-05-01 21:16:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which works I guess
2014-05-01 21:17:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think that is more literary
2014-05-01 21:17:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]than clear and technical
2014-05-01 21:17:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In my opinion
2014-05-01 21:17:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it doesn't really matter
2014-05-01 21:17:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can do whatever you want
2014-05-01 21:17:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-01 21:17:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]a fair opinion, but I think everyone reading it will know what I mean
2014-05-01 21:18:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]here, I'm going to go home so we can talk not through type
2014-05-01 21:18:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-05-01 21:38:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Those aren't examples of synecdoches, but it is symbolic, in my opinion.
2014-05-02 08:37:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Your morning snaps make me so happy. I love seeing your face as soon as I wake up. And I want to kiss you really bad!! Have a fun trip.
2014-05-02 09:26:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would do anything for a kiss right now
2014-05-02 14:29:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On the bus. Wishing for a squishy shoulder to sleep on
2014-05-02 14:29:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too many profs on this bus for me to go into ball mode
2014-05-02 16:15:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha bummer.
2014-05-02 17:04:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How are you?

2014-05-02 20:37:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Networking and talking to strangers tires me out I guess

2014-05-02 20:46:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so she's gonna send me a video of it
2014-05-02 20:46:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm pissed they didn't tell me
2014-05-02 20:47:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to see it!!
2014-05-02 20:47:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That is kinda fucked up though
2014-05-02 20:47:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hopefully she sends me the video
2014-05-02 20:47:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-05-02 20:47:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the whole experience was pretty negative actually
2014-05-02 20:47:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so this sort of just seals it
2014-05-02 20:47:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-02 20:48:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it capped off my shitty 2013 pretty appropriately
2014-05-02 20:48:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why else was the show shitty?
2014-05-02 20:48:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well
2014-05-02 20:49:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they put you in this little room
2014-05-02 20:49:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in the back
2014-05-02 20:49:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with other contestants
2014-05-02 20:49:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you aren't allowed to leave
2014-05-02 20:49:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're not allowed to use your phone
2014-05-02 20:49:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're not allowed to bring anything in
2014-05-02 20:49:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you don't know when you're gonna go on
2014-05-02 20:49:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you have to pay your way there
2014-05-02 20:50:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you're guaranteed $1000 if you get on the show
2014-05-02 20:50:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I was like, okay
2014-05-02 20:50:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll do it.
2014-05-02 20:50:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but once we got there
2014-05-02 20:50:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they made it sound like the odds of us getting on the show weren't very good
2014-05-02 20:50:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I was there on the first day from like 7:30 AM to 6:30 PM or something
2014-05-02 20:50:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I didn't get on
2014-05-02 20:50:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I basically stressed out the whole day
2014-05-02 20:50:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was really exhausted
2014-05-02 20:50:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]didn't eat
2014-05-02 20:51:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and was worried I'd just blown like $1000 I didn't have
2014-05-02 20:51:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the next day rolls around
2014-05-02 20:51:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]get there early again
2014-05-02 20:51:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still have no idea if I'm gonna get on the show
2014-05-02 20:51:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]stress the whole day
2014-05-02 20:51:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]finally around like 5:00 P
2014-05-02 20:51:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]M
2014-05-02 20:51:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](the taping stops at 6 or something)
2014-05-02 20:51:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they tell me I'm gonna go on
2014-05-02 20:51:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm just wired as fuck
2014-05-02 20:52:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and so I end up taking a stupid risk on my third question
2014-05-02 20:52:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when I have $25 k in the bank already
2014-05-02 20:52:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and miss it
2014-05-02 20:52:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and so I ended up not making any money
2014-05-02 20:52:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]breaking even
2014-05-02 20:52:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]being stressed out for two days
2014-05-02 20:52:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and because I was trapped in that room the entire time
2014-05-02 20:52:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't get to really see any of NYC
2014-05-02 20:52:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I had never been there before
2014-05-02 20:53:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sooo
2014-05-02 20:53:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-05-02 20:53:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure I'd feel better if I had won some money
2014-05-02 20:53:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it was still shitty
2014-05-02 20:53:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I just felt really bad about missing the question afterwards
2014-05-02 20:53:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was embarassed
2014-05-02 20:53:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and just like
2014-05-02 20:53:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah that sounds pretty stressful
2014-05-02 20:53:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]shell shocked about how much money I had lost.
2014-05-02 20:54:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]being on the show was actually fun
2014-05-02 20:54:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the five minutes or so that was happening
2014-05-02 20:54:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-02 20:54:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you hit a checkpoint after 25 k?
2014-05-02 20:54:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but everything else was miserable
2014-05-02 20:54:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-05-02 20:54:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they do it different now
2014-05-02 20:54:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I think is part of the reason I took that stupid risk
2014-05-02 20:54:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the first like 10 questions are randomized
2014-05-02 20:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in difficulty
2014-05-02 20:54:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and in money
2014-05-02 20:54:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you don't know if the questions are gimmes or not early on
2014-05-02 20:55:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I barely really remember being on the show
2014-05-02 20:56:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it feels like a dream kinda
2014-05-02 20:56:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was so intense and I was so wired
2014-05-02 20:56:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe they do that on purpose
2014-05-02 20:56:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't have been so stressed if I was one of the first people to go, though
2014-05-02 20:57:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I doubt they were targeting me
2014-05-02 20:57:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-02 20:57:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]honestly, I don't even care about the money
2014-05-02 20:57:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well thats true
2014-05-02 20:57:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just embarrassed that I look dumb
2014-05-02 20:57:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it like really bothered me
2014-05-02 20:58:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Everyone you care about knows you aren't dumb
2014-05-02 20:59:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I know. I still felt really bad about it. Like I let everyone down.
2014-05-02 20:59:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good, though!
2014-05-02 20:59:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not many people can say they had that experience
2014-05-02 21:00:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not many people can say they bombed either
2014-05-02 21:00:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I got that going for me
2014-05-02 21:00:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-02 21:00:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now I can focus on getting on Jeopardy!
2014-05-02 21:00:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dudeeee
2014-05-02 21:00:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I could say I'm dating a guy who was on jeopardy...
2014-05-02 21:00:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-05-02 21:01:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause it's obviously all about me
2014-05-02 21:01:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-02 21:01:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man
2014-05-02 21:02:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was so down at that point in my life
2014-05-02 21:02:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like it would be completely different if it happened now
2014-05-02 21:02:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just having you there would have made it completely different I think
2014-05-02 21:03:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That comment makes me very happy
2014-05-02 21:03:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, good    😃 
2014-05-02 21:04:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it bums me out thinking about you being down at any point. 
2014-05-02 21:04:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word, it bums me out too
2014-05-02 21:04:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it was for the best, though
2014-05-02 21:04:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I came out of it a better and happier person
2014-05-02 21:05:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's usually how it works
2014-05-02 21:05:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unfortunately 
2014-05-02 21:05:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I hear
2014-05-02 21:05:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I've had my fill of feeling like that, though
2014-05-02 21:06:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Agreed
2014-05-02 21:07:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't ever want to be a source for that!
2014-05-02 21:09:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, I hope not.
2014-05-02 21:10:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's honestly the only thing that scares me about this relationship.
2014-05-02 21:10:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That you'll just wake up one day and be over me.
2014-05-02 21:10:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I guess there's nothing either of us can do about that!
2014-05-02 21:11:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just glad that didn't scare me away from going for it with you.
2014-05-02 21:11:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was worried for a while that I wouldn't ever get completely invested in a relationship again
2014-05-02 21:11:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's obviously not the case
2014-05-02 21:11:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-02 21:14:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I felt that way for years, especially considering past failed relationships in that time. And I'm definitely scared about how I feel for you
2014-05-02 21:15:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And still worry sometimes I'm a rebound you'll wake up from one day 
2014-05-02 21:15:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can promise you you aren't a rebound
2014-05-02 21:16:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like this is really special
2014-05-02 21:16:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you make me feel naïve and romantic
2014-05-02 21:16:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like everything is gonna work out
2014-05-02 21:17:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like we're perfect for each other
2014-05-02 21:17:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's fun feeling like that
2014-05-02 21:18:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like nothing I've really experienced before.
2014-05-02 21:19:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:) To steal your words, I'm so into you
2014-05-02 21:19:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-05-02 21:19:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we got a good thing going here
2014-05-02 21:22:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dont want you to get fed up with the long distance part though,  I know you said you aren't into that
2014-05-02 21:22:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's going to be hard for me
2014-05-02 21:22:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you are worth it
2014-05-02 21:23:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really have a choice
2014-05-02 21:23:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-02 21:24:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd basically be judging any girl I met to your impossible standard and I'd be miserable anyway.
2014-05-02 21:28:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I don't want bitterness to build up because of silly things
2014-05-02 21:29:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's actually my biggest fear
2014-05-02 21:29:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-05-02 21:31:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miscommunication, not being able to talk when the other person wants to, pettiness(which neither of us really seem to have that much), the general wear and tear stress of long distance
2014-05-02 21:31:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Disinterest from the time between visits
2014-05-02 21:31:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you're freaking me out, man!
2014-05-02 21:32:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry! I don't think that will happen for me
2014-05-02 21:32:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was j/k... kinda
2014-05-02 21:32:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-02 21:33:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'll just need to keep my expectations in check
2014-05-02 21:33:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I think I've been managing to do
2014-05-02 21:35:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now I'm pulling a Michael! Getting all down in the dumps about hypothetical situations
2014-05-02 21:36:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man... don't!
2014-05-02 21:36:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know...
2014-05-02 21:37:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you do a really good job of making me feel like I'm a part of your life even when we're apart
2014-05-02 21:37:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know there are gonna be times when you aren't going to be able to be as connected
2014-05-02 21:37:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if you just keep doing what you're doing when you can
2014-05-02 21:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'll be as content as I can be without physically being in your presence
2014-05-02 21:38:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's mostly comforting I guess
2014-05-02 21:38:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright I'm gonna just crash
2014-05-02 21:39:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-05-02 21:39:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should join me in the romantic optimism
2014-05-02 21:39:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're gonna live happily ever after    😉 
2014-05-02 21:40:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I do! Maybe more than you know
2014-05-02 21:42:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you, and will spend the minutes before sleep imaging slow, intimate kisses with you (like I almost always do)
2014-05-02 21:42:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awwwww
2014-05-02 21:42:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man, I miss you

2014-05-03 13:17:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My grandma Gray (my mom's mom) told my mom that she saw pictures of you and that you're beautiful    😃 
2014-05-03 13:18:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]apparently another one of my mom's siblings (she forgets who) commented on your eyes too
2014-05-03 13:18:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha

2014-05-03 16:06:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It helps the time pass during boring talks 
2014-05-03 16:07:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though it can make me feel a little restless too haha
2014-05-03 16:07:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I bet, I hope it makes you squirm a bit    😉 
2014-05-03 16:09:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure I look like I have ants in my pants haha
2014-05-03 16:10:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]somehow simultaneously extremely sexy and adorable
2014-05-03 16:10:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I especially keep thinking about being pushed up against your wall...
2014-05-03 16:11:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mmm you're getting me all riled up now
2014-05-03 16:11:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you definitely seemed to enjoy that
2014-05-03 16:11:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did too
2014-05-03 16:17:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh ok I can't handle this conversation haha
2014-05-03 16:17:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too much squirming now
2014-05-03 16:17:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha

2014-05-03 16:17:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm totally distracted now
2014-05-03 19:50:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Gehrke's there?!
2014-05-03 19:50:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you tell him I'm trying to get in on a softball game?
2014-05-03 19:52:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I will
2014-05-03 19:52:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does he know about our "situation"
2014-05-03 19:52:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't talk to him very much
2014-05-03 19:52:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I can bring it up 
2014-05-03 19:52:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think he'd get a kick out of it based on some convos we've had in the past
2014-05-03 19:53:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in Austin actually
2014-05-03 19:53:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you mean? 
2014-05-03 19:53:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Explain haha
2014-05-03 19:53:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-03 19:53:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we just talked about relationship stuff and whatever
2014-05-03 19:53:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I said I wasn't looking for anything
2014-05-03 19:53:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and was kinda turned off by relationships
2014-05-03 19:54:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that if the perfect girl fell into my life I wouldn't resist
2014-05-03 19:54:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm
2014-05-03 19:54:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I guess that's comforting?
2014-05-03 19:54:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha why wouldn't it be?
2014-05-03 19:54:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I also might've commented on the fact that you looked OK in a bathing suit
2014-05-03 19:59:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To gerke??
2014-05-03 19:59:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's great
2014-05-03 19:59:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-05-03 19:59:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]might have been more specific about a certain attribute of yours that you know I'm fond of
2014-05-03 20:00:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well he says he "dreams about you playing a softball game"
2014-05-03 20:00:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-03 20:00:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love that dude
2014-05-03 20:00:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well now I feel terribly awkward 
2014-05-03 20:00:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-03 20:02:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He seems to have already been aware of it 
2014-05-03 20:02:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha maybe news spreads faster than I think
2014-05-03 20:02:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I suppose word gets around in the cluster
2014-05-03 20:02:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And he asked if I like you with a beard haha
2014-05-03 20:03:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your response?
2014-05-03 20:05:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am more ok with the long hair than the long bears
2014-05-03 20:05:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*Beard
2014-05-03 20:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought you liked the long hair, though?
2014-05-03 20:05:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But the pic he shower from your 1st year was super cute
2014-05-03 20:06:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's the pic?
2014-05-03 20:08:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You are around super croc

2014-05-03 20:39:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nothing right now
2014-05-03 20:40:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're gonna hit up this bar a little later
2014-05-03 20:40:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you pay for a certain amount of ounces
2014-05-03 20:40:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you get a wristband
2014-05-03 20:40:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then you can go to different taps and scan the wristband and fill up until you run out of ounces
2014-05-03 20:40:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You and you're family?
2014-05-03 20:40:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah. Me, Noelle, my mom, and my dad

2014-05-03 20:41:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]crashing an undergrad party like a boss
2014-05-03 20:41:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm
2014-05-03 20:43:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That SuperCroc pic made me think of this one
2014-05-03 20:43:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should show it to Gehrke if you get the chance
2014-05-03 20:43:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this was at the orientation thing at the zoo
2014-05-03 20:44:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't sleep with any 20 yr olds 
2014-05-03 20:44:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't compete

2014-05-03 21:32:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think anyone can compete  
2014-05-03 21:33:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm already counting down the days 
2014-05-03 21:33:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃

2014-05-03 22:28:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't believe you just said that over Hangouts
2014-05-03 22:28:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I definitely love you
2014-05-03 22:28:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and was planning on telling you in person in Chicago
2014-05-03 22:28:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess the cat is out of the bag now.
2014-05-03 22:30:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can still tell me :)
2014-05-03 22:31:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you're right 
2014-05-03 22:32:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm probably overly concerned  
2014-05-03 22:32:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]overly concerned about what?
2014-05-03 22:34:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"I love you 
2014-05-03 22:34:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not following
2014-05-03 22:43:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-05-04 02:00:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm slightly more sober Katie is reading this now
2014-05-04 02:02:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Had a feeling
2014-05-04 02:02:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And saying we should table future discussions on the subject until in person 
2014-05-04 02:04:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]K
2014-05-04 02:05:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why are you still up?
2014-05-04 02:06:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#GettinCrunk
2014-05-04 02:07:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You?
2014-05-04 02:07:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just woke up in bed haha
2014-05-04 02:08:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Open bar blurred out most of the fine detail after dinner -_-
2014-05-04 02:10:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-05-04 02:11:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel pretty silly now
2014-05-04 02:14:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Same.
2014-05-04 02:14:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh no you shouldn't!
2014-05-04 02:16:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's pretend it didn't happen, and save some romanticism for the next time we see each other 
2014-05-04 02:16:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm glad I at least didn't fresh you out :)
2014-05-04 02:17:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*freak
2014-05-04 09:08:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhhhhhhh
2014-05-04 09:22:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha
2014-05-04 09:25:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm so hungover I was sick
2014-05-04 09:25:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man :( I guess they don't mess around at Woods Hole
2014-05-04 09:27:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well we also pregamed the open bar with whiskey shots
2014-05-04 09:27:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good time at least?
2014-05-04 09:27:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice
2014-05-04 09:28:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a good time, I just don't remember really anything after 10 which is always disconcerting
2014-05-04 09:28:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We went to a local bar
2014-05-04 09:29:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-05-04 09:29:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was your night?
2014-05-04 09:30:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good. Went to a few bars with my sister, her boyfriend, and her friend.
2014-05-04 09:31:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That sounds like fun
2014-05-04 09:31:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No 20 yr olds? Haha
2014-05-04 09:33:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just a few
2014-05-04 09:33:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh, well I guess that's ok
2014-05-04 09:36:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you unhappy about my drunk text?
2014-05-04 09:36:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not crazy about it, but it's all good
2014-05-04 09:37:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:(
2014-05-04 09:39:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should've asked if you were intoxicated, because I had a feeling. Just ended up being exchange.
2014-05-04 09:39:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A weird exchange
2014-05-04 09:45:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I have no idea what I meant by concerned, I probably realized I had kinda fucked up something important and just passed out 
2014-05-04 09:45:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry
2014-05-04 09:46:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's on the agenda for today?
2014-05-04 09:46:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I skipped a couple talks this morning
2014-05-04 09:47:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gonna hopefully get out of bed soon and go to the last ones before getting on the bus at 2:30
2014-05-04 09:49:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool.
2014-05-04 09:49:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-05-04 10:30:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you.
2014-05-04 10:31:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't wait to see you.
2014-05-04 10:33:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't wait either
2014-05-04 10:34:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm starting to peel a little on my titties though, which is unattractive...
2014-05-04 10:34:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-05-04 10:34:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ewwwww
2014-05-04 10:34:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ew indeed
2014-05-04 10:35:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]As long as the nipples are clear we'll be good ;)
2014-05-04 10:37:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha out of context that sounds very strange
2014-05-04 10:39:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. It sounded strange even when I sent it, but I just wanted to get the image of me sucking your titties in your head
2014-05-04 10:39:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhhh man
2014-05-04 10:40:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well it certainly is now
2014-05-04 10:41:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha good ;)
2014-05-04 10:44:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Slightly inappropriate snap on the way
2014-05-04 10:44:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Om nom nom
2014-05-04 10:46:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are the sleeping arrangements there?
2014-05-04 10:52:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Single rooms
2014-05-04 10:52:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not particularly comfy beds
2014-05-04 10:58:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word.
2014-05-04 10:59:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My hangover status is rapidly declining.
2014-05-04 11:00:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't realize you were hungover too
2014-05-04 11:01:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I had a headache when I woke up, but it feels worse now and I'm starting to feel a little nauseous :(
2014-05-04 11:01:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh
2014-05-04 11:02:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eat some pancakes!
2014-05-04 11:02:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha eating doesn't help me like it does other people.
2014-05-04 11:03:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need to just sit in the shower, but that would require me getting up and going downstairs.
2014-05-04 11:04:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:(
2014-05-04 11:04:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd rub your back if .i could
2014-05-04 11:04:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, that would be perfect
2014-05-04 11:34:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Puuuked 😖
2014-05-04 11:34:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We are very in sync this morning
2014-05-04 11:35:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Beer hangovers wreck me.
2014-05-04 11:35:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wine
2014-05-04 12:29:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made it to lunch. Apparently i was not the only Darwinian puking this morning haha
2014-05-04 12:31:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I guess I told everyone I was just escorting Nicole back to the dorm around 11:30 and then never came back haha
2014-05-04 12:49:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha wow. Nothing like getting sloppy drunk to bring people together.
2014-05-04 12:50:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder how many people you professed your love to last night?
2014-05-04 12:50:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:p
2014-05-04 13:13:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No one realized I was that drunk, I must've been playing it cool 
2014-05-04 13:14:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And don't joke about it, I feel pretty bad
2014-05-04 13:19:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man... don't feel bad. That's why I was trying to joke about it. I'm sure it'll be a funny story for us in the future, but I guess it's still pretty fresh.
2014-05-04 13:25:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, that's good to hear
2014-05-04 13:25:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're your plans with the family today?
2014-05-04 13:27:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Zane is giving a monologue in this student theater thing, so we're gonna watch that. Noelle's boyfriend wanted me to go to this pizza place with them took drink some Pliny the Elder, but I think I'm over beer for the moment, haha
2014-05-04 13:28:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Having lots of siblings sounds really fun
2014-05-04 13:30:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I like it. I used to think I wanted to have several kids for that reason.
2014-05-04 13:45:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dylan is talking to my dad about retirement plans. He's such a grownup.
2014-05-04 14:07:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]About his plans, or your dad's plans?
2014-05-04 14:08:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]His!

2014-05-04 14:20:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tim and Tom talked a lot about job prospects this weekend, which was grim at times. 
2014-05-04 14:23:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I mean I guess there's always gonna be jobs for y'all, they just might not super cushy or exactly what you want.
2014-05-04 14:24:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But you'd still be something you love, which is pretty cool!
2014-05-04 14:25:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We all decided we would just marry rich haha
2014-05-04 14:25:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha hell yeah, man.

2014-05-04 14:46:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I know. I'm not really sure why it can't happen still.
2014-05-04 14:46:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'd think a university would be able to fix something like that quickly
2014-05-04 14:46:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He's gonna give us a private performance anyway

2014-05-05 11:07:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha soo much effort.
2014-05-05 11:10:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't find it
2014-05-05 11:13:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There you are!
2014-05-05 11:13:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha hooray!
2014-05-05 11:32:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My dad's hooking me up with a Starwood reservation in St. Louis.
2014-05-05 11:33:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oooooo
2014-05-05 11:33:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know what that is, but it sounds fancy
2014-05-05 11:33:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I should come down after all?
2014-05-05 11:36:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We'd have a nice bed :)
2014-05-05 11:42:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you'll be sleepy and cranky after driving that long
2014-05-05 11:43:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And won't even want to cuddle with me :(
2014-05-05 11:45:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Whaaat? I'm offended you'd say such a thing!
2014-05-05 11:46:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's how you were after driving up from Texas 
2014-05-05 11:46:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's totally understandable 
2014-05-05 11:47:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It will have been a really long day 
2014-05-05 11:51:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha was I? I don't even really remember. That's quite a bit longer of a drive, but it's all good.
2014-05-05 11:51:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sorry I was cranky and not cuddly. I feel bad.
2014-05-05 11:53:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You should tell me if I'm ever being mean/cranky
2014-05-05 11:53:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha it's ok, we got plenty of cuddling in that morning
2014-05-05 11:53:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You weren't mean! Just sleeeeeepyyy
2014-05-05 11:55:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What hotel is it? If it's near enough to the train station I'll come. I don't think I'll be able to sleep that night knowing you're only 5 hours away
2014-05-05 11:55:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even just lying next to you would be worth it :)
2014-05-05 11:59:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's the Starwood, but I'm about to roll out we can talk about it tonight!
2014-05-05 11:59:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok ok, mwah!

2014-05-05 22:28:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]First leg down.
2014-05-05 23:07:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll be home in 10, chat?
2014-05-05 23:07:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For sure.
2014-05-05 23:36:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where are youuu
2014-05-06 08:38:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My mom is putting you on the reservation :D
2014-05-06 08:38:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yay! 
2014-05-06 08:39:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She doesn't think that's scandalous, right?
2014-05-06 08:40:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha not any more scandalous than us staying at each other's apartments I'd imagine.
2014-05-06 08:41:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well except they're paying for our romantic tryst hahaha
2014-05-06 08:42:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm booking a train ticket!
2014-05-06 08:42:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yes!
2014-05-06 08:43:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The 12, correct?
2014-05-06 08:44:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yes.
2014-05-06 08:46:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Less than a week?
2014-05-06 08:46:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*!!
2014-05-06 08:46:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can't wait :)
2014-05-06 08:47:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have a safe drive my dear
2014-05-06 08:47:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll be stalking you right along :)
2014-05-06 08:48:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha thanks, hon :)
2014-05-06 09:37:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Getting in at 10:45p, gonna take a nice long (hot) bath and get all warmed up for you :)
2014-05-06 11:47:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You can be very subtly sexy at times. I like it a lot
2014-05-06 11:48:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I don't know how subtle that was, but I'm glad you like it!
2014-05-06 11:55:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, yeah I guess that wasn't super subtle, but the sexiness was implied. I guess you kinda tease me a bit.
2014-05-06 14:08:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gotta keep you hooked somehow ;)
2014-05-06 17:36:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Made it.
2014-05-06 18:01:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Google has a deal going with Uber, apparently. The Google Maps update has this to say " Don’t limit your options.   Frequent   Uber   rider? If you have the Uber app installed, you can now compare your ride with transit and walking directions right from Google Maps in some cities. And if you choose the Uber option, you’ll jump right into the Uber app with just one click."
2014-05-06 18:29:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ooo fancy
2014-05-06 18:29:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Glad you made it!
2014-05-06 18:30:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how's your day going?
2014-05-06 18:31:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol is that ethics?
2014-05-06 18:31:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How are you getting away with making that face?
2014-05-06 18:32:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Decent. We're on a break
2014-05-06 18:32:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't have to move out until the 17! More days not on a twin bed!
2014-05-06 18:32:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yesss
2014-05-06 18:33:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]several days of an apartment all to ourselves too
2014-05-06 20:07:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This was a pretty good podcast  http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/524/i-was-so-high
2014-05-06 20:07:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I related a lot to Act One. I used to feel similar to the way the host feels.
2014-05-06 20:38:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll have to listen to it when I'm home
2014-05-06 20:39:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The title sounds intriguing 
2014-05-06 20:47:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The better stories were kinda negative towards drug use, so it felt a little unbalanced to me.
2014-05-06 20:47:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it was still a good listen.
2014-05-06 21:59:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm
2014-05-06 21:59:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm at the cove with cohort and for Molly's last night in town 
2014-05-06 21:59:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]funnn
2014-05-06 21:59:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we need to go to The Cove while I'm there
2014-05-06 21:59:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't been in a long time
2014-05-06 22:00:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can make that happen 
2014-05-06 22:00:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was thinking that or the Pub after Ethics
2014-05-06 22:00:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. Maybe we can do both?!
2014-05-06 22:03:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Rallying troops may be tricky, but I'll go anywhere with you 
2014-05-06 22:03:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awwwwwwwwww
2014-05-06 22:03:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're so effing sweet
2014-05-06 22:08:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Guess how many times I daydreamed about you today?
2014-05-06 22:09:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmmm I'm gonna go with once an hour
2014-05-06 22:09:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]soo
2014-05-06 22:09:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]16 times
2014-05-06 23:21:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nailed it
2014-05-06 23:21:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though ethics had a significant increase in rare
2014-05-06 23:22:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-06 23:22:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got home. You studying?
2014-05-06 23:22:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is this just daydreaming in general?
2014-05-06 23:22:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or sexy daydreams?
2014-05-06 23:22:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*rate
2014-05-06 23:22:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]General 
2014-05-06 23:22:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw
2014-05-06 23:22:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But most of them involved us at least on a bed
2014-05-06 23:23:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-06 23:23:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you do seem to enjoy those times    😃 
2014-05-06 23:23:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]i am home
2014-05-06 23:23:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you didn't ask that
2014-05-06 23:23:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm working on my project
2014-05-06 23:23:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think I'm pretty much done with it
2014-05-06 23:24:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woo woo
2014-05-06 23:24:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-06 23:24:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was The Cove?
2014-05-06 23:25:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was good. Pretty chill with good conversation 
2014-05-06 23:25:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's good
2014-05-06 23:28:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wish I could hit the fast forward button on my life right now
2014-05-06 23:28:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-06 23:29:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know! It's probably much worse for you.
2014-05-06 23:29:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-05-06 23:29:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I have deceptively few responsibilities 
2014-05-06 23:30:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds awesome
2014-05-06 23:30:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's gonna be me next week
2014-05-06 23:30:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm gonna effing lov it
2014-05-06 23:30:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I am seriously pumped for next week
2014-05-06 23:33:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too 
2014-05-06 23:33:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though it'll be a bit of a whirlwind
2014-05-06 23:33:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, yeah, yeah
2014-05-06 23:34:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why you gotta go and bring me down like that?
2014-05-06 23:34:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-06 23:34:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll make time for some slow and sweet moments 
2014-05-06 23:34:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good
2014-05-06 23:35:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And selfishly I know I'll be really happy to have you around during an otherwise slightly stressful time 
2014-05-06 23:36:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Keep me calm
2014-05-06 23:36:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's gonna be stressing you out next week?
2014-05-06 23:36:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]moving?
2014-05-06 23:36:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And be an almost normal relationship situation 
2014-05-06 23:36:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that'll be nice
2014-05-06 23:37:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Moving and packing and planning my field season before I go out of country
2014-05-06 23:37:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It won't be that that busy, just a little scattered
2014-05-06 23:37:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, that's definitely a lot to think about and prepare for
2014-05-06 23:38:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This Chinese dude's parents will be staying at my apt
2014-05-06 23:38:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How random is that
2014-05-06 23:38:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why?
2014-05-06 23:39:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause the guy that wanted to sublet did it for them
2014-05-06 23:39:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And didn't tell me until he looked at the place today
2014-05-06 23:40:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm confused.
2014-05-06 23:40:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Next time we chat I'll explain it
2014-05-06 23:40:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-05-06 23:41:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It gives us more time here though which is good
2014-05-06 23:42:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-05-06 23:43:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you keep yourself quiet during sex when living with roommates?
2014-05-06 23:43:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!
2014-05-06 23:44:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm, as mentioned I'm not used to really having orgasms at the frequency and intensity that I seem to with you
2014-05-06 23:45:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I am capable of quieting down a bit, it's just not nearly as fun
2014-05-06 23:46:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah. Probably the biggest downside of having roommates.
2014-05-06 23:46:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and not being able to have sex wherever you want whenever you want.
2014-05-06 23:46:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And even harder to cum because I'm thinking too much. But maybe that won't be as big of an issue with you
2014-05-06 23:47:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think it'll be that big a deal. Darcy is a grown up, who alternates weekends with her long term boyfriend
2014-05-06 23:47:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Don't think what will be a big deal?
2014-05-06 23:48:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's funny seeing you say "harder to cum". I seriously thought you were faking it the first time we had sex.
2014-05-06 23:48:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If some noisy sex happens when you're here once every month or so
2014-05-06 23:48:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh ok
2014-05-06 23:50:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you faked it the 3rd time, because it didn't make sense you'd have recovered already 
2014-05-06 23:50:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha I remember you asking me!
2014-05-06 23:50:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I was like how would I even fake that?
2014-05-06 23:50:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess it's not obvious from your end.
2014-05-06 23:52:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've seen a couple guys fake it, either when they tried to start something they couldn't finish and/or realized I was kinda over it
2014-05-06 23:52:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-06 23:52:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Neither of which is an issue with you :)
2014-05-06 23:52:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maaan
2014-05-06 23:53:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]having a girl be "over it" while having sex would totally wreck my ego
2014-05-06 23:53:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-06 23:54:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even know what that means
2014-05-06 23:54:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I don't want to know
2014-05-06 23:54:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-06 23:56:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha ok, I guess I just mean when it's clear I wasn't going to reach a climax and was tired
2014-05-06 23:57:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-05-06 23:57:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's kinda different for me.
2014-05-06 23:57:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not used to a girl getting off through penetration
2014-05-06 23:58:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that part was never about getting the girl off for me
2014-05-06 23:58:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So sex would be just about your pleasure?
2014-05-06 23:58:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well, they liked it
2014-05-06 23:59:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they just couldn't orgasm that way
2014-05-06 23:59:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it would typically involve getting them off some other way first
2014-05-06 23:59:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then finishing with penetration
2014-05-06 23:59:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I shouldn't say couldn't
2014-05-06 23:59:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was very hard
2014-05-07 00:02:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The word penetration is kinda not sexy at the moment, but that might be because we learned about mechanical isolation in bugs today haha
2014-05-07 00:02:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is it ever sexy?
2014-05-07 00:02:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just using it to differentiate sex acts
2014-05-07 00:03:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah I know
2014-05-07 00:03:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's probably more just in relation to being with other women
2014-05-07 00:04:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, my bad.
2014-05-07 00:06:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No noo it's ok haha
2014-05-07 00:06:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I asked 
2014-05-07 00:08:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do orgasms feel different if they're via sex vs. other means
2014-05-07 00:11:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Orgasms when you're in me with a little bit of clitoral stimulation make my whole body and head feel like it's filling and emptying and exploding at the same time. Clitoral only orgasms are a lot more localized, but still feel pretty good 
2014-05-07 00:12:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A second orgasm not too long after a 1st is usually more intense 
2014-05-07 00:13:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-05-07 00:13:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that first description sounds intense
2014-05-07 00:13:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-07 00:14:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How would you describe an orgasm?
2014-05-07 00:14:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have no idea
2014-05-07 00:14:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just thinking that after reading your description
2014-05-07 00:14:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-07 00:14:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's very primal I guess
2014-05-07 00:14:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like complete loss of self
2014-05-07 00:14:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I guess is what makes it hard to explain
2014-05-07 00:15:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A loss of self is probably part of what I'm trying to explain
2014-05-07 00:16:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's actually super weird to think about now that I'm thinking about it
2014-05-07 00:16:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-07 00:19:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No need to over analyze it haha, but a conversation I wouldn't mind having again one day in person. It's something I've wondered about (physical/emotional/psychological elements of an orgasm between man and woman) but never really talked to anyone about.
2014-05-07 00:20:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, I'd be down with that.
2014-05-07 00:20:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I wasn't over-analyzing it
2014-05-07 00:21:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just don't think I've ever really focused on trying to describe what the feeling is like
2014-05-07 00:21:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's almost like I have no idea what it actually feels like
2014-05-07 00:21:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I know I like it
2014-05-07 00:22:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well maybe it will be easier to describe when the feeling is fresh in your mind, with lots of replicates :)
2014-05-07 00:22:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-07 00:22:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like the sound of that
2014-05-07 00:24:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmm
2014-05-07 00:24:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes, indeed
2014-05-07 00:25:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to try to sleep. 
2014-05-07 00:25:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-05-07 00:26:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't believe how intellectually and sexually stimulated you make me all the time
2014-05-07 00:26:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And just generally really happy
2014-05-07 00:26:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the feeling is very mutual
2014-05-07 00:27:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking the other day how there are like three things I'm really into about you
2014-05-07 00:27:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]physical, intellectual, and then this third part
2014-05-07 00:27:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that I guess is just your personality
2014-05-07 00:28:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is your goofiness and your affectionateness
2014-05-07 00:28:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and things like that
2014-05-07 00:28:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not necessarily the super complex stuff
2014-05-07 00:29:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What counts as the super complex stuff? Do you mean you don't like that as much?
2014-05-07 00:29:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nooo
2014-05-07 00:29:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like
2014-05-07 00:29:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the smart stuff
2014-05-07 00:29:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like that lot
2014-05-07 00:30:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I put that in the intellectual category, though
2014-05-07 00:30:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the stuff about your personality that isn't really that
2014-05-07 00:30:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your flirtiness
2014-05-07 00:30:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the way you smile at me
2014-05-07 00:30:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the way you hold my hand
2014-05-07 00:30:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the goofy jokes
2014-05-07 00:31:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh dear you're gonna make me tear up a little bit
2014-05-07 00:32:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when you say things like "Rallying troops may be tricky, but I'll go anywhere with you"
2014-05-07 00:32:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw
2014-05-07 00:32:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I just want you to know that I'm really into all aspects of you
2014-05-07 00:33:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty amazing someone like you exists
2014-05-07 00:35:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There are a lot of people on the planet. I'm not that much of a statistical anomaly.
2014-05-07 00:35:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] ...sorry I'm cracking lame jokes cause everything you're saying is making me so overwhelmingly happy I don't even know how to respond.
2014-05-07 00:35:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-07 00:35:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good
2014-05-07 00:36:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'd say you are a statistical anomaly
2014-05-07 00:38:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd say your sample size was too small, but it is certainly working in my favor.
2014-05-07 00:38:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Let's wait 6 more days to get into this, so I can better express how I feel while wrapped up in you 
2014-05-07 00:38:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*on you *under you *next to you
2014-05-07 00:39:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃  ok 
2014-05-07 00:43:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight. Falling asleep incredibly happy again because of you, somehow you overcome some of the long distance thing without even you're voice :)
2014-05-07 00:44:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet dreams. Counting down the days...
2014-05-07 10:57:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nooo my place is much much cleaner for once!
2014-05-07 13:12:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you still have your uchicago id? Bring it and the field one if you do!
2014-05-07 13:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll bring them. What are they for?
2014-05-07 13:26:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's a grad social thing in case we wanna get some free beer. And the museum pass may be nice for something
2014-05-07 13:26:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds good
2014-05-07 13:42:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm making a target run, what snacks/food do you want for while you're here? I already have lucky charms...
2014-05-07 13:43:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha umm. It's up to you. I don't typically snack much. Maybe some fruit? Ice cream?
2014-05-07 13:44:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe some stuff for making dinner together if you wanted to do that?
2014-05-07 13:44:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would :)
2014-05-07 13:45:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You have to suggest some meal ideas though haha
2014-05-07 13:45:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can't even do it!
2014-05-07 13:45:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're the food person
2014-05-07 13:46:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're the limiting food person though, I'll eat anything 
2014-05-07 13:47:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I have a couple ideas if you're really struggling
2014-05-07 13:47:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah, that's really not my area
2014-05-07 13:47:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm down with branching out a bit too
2014-05-07 13:47:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't want you to think of me as this boring food person
2014-05-07 13:47:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-07 13:50:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't, I think of you as someone who just needs to be exposed to more foods :)
2014-05-07 13:50:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I can dig that.
2014-05-07 15:37:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You want to help me pick out a couple pairs of jeans while I'm there?
2014-05-07 15:40:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes!
2014-05-07 15:40:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm honored 
2014-05-07 15:40:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-05-07 15:41:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool. Well plan on doing that then.
2014-05-07 15:41:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should buy a pair of grown up non-super-tight-low-rise jeans too
2014-05-07 15:42:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Bummer :(
2014-05-07 15:43:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha for school, not for anything else
2014-05-07 15:43:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]J/k I'm sure you'll be banging no matter what.
2014-05-07 18:10:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh man that picture wasn't fair
2014-05-07 18:11:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, my bad. How was the run?
2014-05-07 18:12:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]9 min miles had me seeing stars by the end, but felt so nice to be running outside 
2014-05-07 18:14:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That might actually kill me.
2014-05-07 18:16:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aww I bet your long legs and muscles could get you farther than you think
2014-05-07 18:17:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The terrible lung capacity is what gets me.
2014-05-07 18:17:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm loling at that pic.
2014-05-07 18:18:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was laying down and she came over and rolled on her back behind me
2014-05-07 18:19:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, she loves you. That's pretty cute.
2014-05-07 18:19:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I almost overhead pressed your bodyweight today.
2014-05-07 18:19:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're soulmates, duh
2014-05-07 18:19:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!
2014-05-07 18:19:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha of course.
2014-05-07 18:20:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is there a difference between overhead and bench press?
2014-05-07 18:20:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That was a weird way to phrase that. I did 120 lb. for five reps on the overhead press.
2014-05-07 18:21:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That didn't answer my question haha
2014-05-07 18:21:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. In overhead you're standing and you rest the bar on your delts and then you push the bar over your head. They're harder.
2014-05-07 18:22:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was referring to myself when I said it was a weird way to phrase it.
2014-05-07 18:25:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If one day you can stand up and do that to me, I'll swoon 
2014-05-07 18:27:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I doubt that'll happen. Humans are a little more awkward to lift than barbells.
2014-05-07 18:27:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can stay reallyyyy still if needed
2014-05-07 18:28:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol, I don't even know where I'd grab you or how I'd get you into position.
2014-05-07 18:28:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sounded pretty sexual.
2014-05-07 18:28:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I liked it
2014-05-07 18:30:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I bet I could Dirty Dancing you with some practice.
2014-05-07 18:30:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now that would actually be a dream come true 
2014-05-07 18:30:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you'd have to be shirtless 
2014-05-07 18:31:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha obviously
2014-05-07 18:34:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think time period 5-3 days away from when I next see you will always feel like slowest.
2014-05-07 18:36:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hear that. And studying for a final does not help speed up time.
2014-05-07 21:39:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You studying all night?
2014-05-07 21:40:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]meh
2014-05-07 21:40:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll probably keep notes open until I go to sleep
2014-05-07 21:40:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to?
2014-05-07 21:40:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That counts. Just put the computer under your head to absorb the knowledge
2014-05-07 21:40:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha exactly
2014-05-07 21:43:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just caught up in some tv, had salmon and fingerfuls of peanut butter for dinner lol
2014-05-07 21:43:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have not accomplished much today, and have been unable to motivate myself. 
2014-05-07 21:44:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which always kinda frustrates me 
2014-05-07 21:44:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But usually after a day like today I can get back on track
2014-05-07 21:45:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's good. Yeah, I hate that feeling of not being able to get motivated to work because then you don't even enjoy the not working part.
2014-05-07 21:50:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly
2014-05-07 21:50:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I just sat around alot after meeting with Cathy and talking about all the little shit I still need to do
2014-05-07 21:51:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Little shit is always the easiest to put off.
2014-05-07 21:52:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I cancelled my Time Warner cable.
2014-05-07 21:52:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or I should say internet
2014-05-07 21:52:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the bill goes through tomorrow
2014-05-07 21:52:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they turned it off last night
2014-05-07 21:52:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so fuck them for that
2014-05-07 21:52:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but...
2014-05-07 21:52:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the address they told me to return the modem to?
2014-05-07 21:52:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there was no Time Warner office there
2014-05-07 21:52:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What??
2014-05-07 21:53:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I call them
2014-05-07 21:53:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]while sitting in the parking lot
2014-05-07 21:53:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and say, there's no office here
2014-05-07 21:53:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you give me a real address
2014-05-07 21:53:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they give me a new address
2014-05-07 21:53:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]guess what?
2014-05-07 21:53:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No office?
2014-05-07 21:53:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's no Time Warner office there!
2014-05-07 21:53:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep
2014-05-07 21:53:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I finally find one on the third attempt
2014-05-07 21:53:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but fuck them
2014-05-07 21:54:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]drives me crazy such a shitty company is just making bank because there's no competition
2014-05-07 21:54:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are they the only provider in your area?
2014-05-07 21:54:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think AT&T just moved in.
2014-05-07 21:56:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So does this mean no skyping until you leave?
2014-05-07 21:56:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can still Skype on my phone, sugar
2014-05-07 21:57:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]An interesting reversal, where now I can video with my computer and you have to deal with the awkward phone holding haha
2014-05-07 21:57:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no doubt
2014-05-07 21:58:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could do it over my computer I guess
2014-05-07 21:58:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but my hotspot craps out at times
2014-05-07 21:58:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm chatting with you on my computer
2014-05-07 21:58:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fancy
2014-05-07 21:59:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what TV did you watch?
2014-05-07 21:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sundays GoT, the season finale of Girls, and an episode of the L word
2014-05-07 21:59:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice.
2014-05-07 22:00:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty excited about catching up on some TV here soon
2014-05-07 22:00:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I recommended Hannibal to my sister, so she's gonna check that out
2014-05-07 22:00:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you seen Twin Peaks?
2014-05-07 22:00:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-05-07 22:00:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've heard good things
2014-05-07 22:01:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Actually I'm not %100 sure you'd like it, but I could be wrong
2014-05-07 22:01:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what makes you hesitate?
2014-05-07 22:02:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I've only seen the first few episodes
2014-05-07 22:02:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's campy and weird and a bit nonsensical at times, and I feel like you might find the dialogue a little biting 
2014-05-07 22:02:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*boring
2014-05-07 22:03:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha interesting
2014-05-07 22:03:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can see the campiness turning me off
2014-05-07 22:03:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder what you're basing the other stuff on, though?
2014-05-07 22:06:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I reminds me of Star Trek NG in a way (probably because of the datedness) and you've said that's not your thing 
2014-05-07 22:06:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't actually given Star Trek a legitimate shot, but I'm not particularly motivated to
2014-05-07 22:06:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not like outdated, just the humor is sooo late 80s/early 90s
2014-05-07 22:07:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if you ever feel like it, watch the first couple episodes and lemme know what you think 
2014-05-07 22:07:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we can watch some together or something
2014-05-07 22:07:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or find another show I guess
2014-05-07 22:08:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that'd be cool to have a show we were both watching
2014-05-07 22:12:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Totes adorbs
2014-05-07 22:13:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmk well I'm gonna read a little bit. If you wanna video sometime let me know!
2014-05-07 22:13:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK, how long you gonna read?
2014-05-07 22:16:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't want to keep you from studying :)
2014-05-07 22:17:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK. Well my exam isn't until 2 tomorrow and I've been studying all day, so I could take a break. How about 11?
2014-05-07 22:18:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds gewd
2014-05-07 23:03:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Time for me to see your pretty face.
2014-05-07 23:04:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Skype
2014-05-07 23:42:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did me complaining about summer bring you down?
2014-05-07 23:52:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No. Sorry if I seemed down. I think just thinking about the long gaps got to me a bit.
2014-05-07 23:55:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know how to make you feel better (more optimistic?) about that aspect of us
2014-05-07 23:56:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all good. You don't have to worry about it!
2014-05-07 23:57:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do if it's causing us to have awkward/weird conversations or making you unhappy
2014-05-07 23:59:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't realize I was being awkward. And I guess this is just how I am. You just gotta let me ride it out. You can avoid me when I get down if you want.
2014-05-08 00:01:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I interpreted the vibe wrong and am tired and a little cranky myself. 
2014-05-08 00:01:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll keep that in mind for the future, though I can't imagine me avoiding talking to you unless that's what you wanted.
2014-05-08 00:04:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I noticed you signed off kinda abruptly.
2014-05-08 00:06:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I try not to get bummed out, but I just can't help it at times.
2014-05-08 00:10:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's ok, really. I couldn't figure out why the conversation stopped flowing and instead of asking about it I just got unnecessarily snappish
2014-05-08 00:13:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-05-08 00:13:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish I was there to hug you right now! 
2014-05-08 00:14:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, that'd be so amazing :)
2014-05-08 00:15:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]One day closer now!

2014-05-08 00:16:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also I approve of the no shirt skyping haha
2014-05-08 00:16:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Alright. Sweet dreams, beautiful. Miss you lots.
2014-05-08 00:17:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Where's my no shirt Skyping?!
2014-05-08 00:17:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Working up to it haha
2014-05-08 00:18:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't wear pants the other day!
2014-05-08 00:18:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I know you rarely wear pants.
2014-05-08 00:19:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like it, that's one of the tease things I was talking about.
2014-05-08 00:19:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP];)
2014-05-08 10:17:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's warmer in Chicago than Dallas!
2014-05-08 10:18:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, it's storming right now.
2014-05-08 10:38:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like sleeping in weather 
2014-05-08 10:41:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I slept until 9, so I got a solid 8.5 hours last night, which is more than I've probably gotten in a while.
2014-05-08 10:42:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How'd you sleep?
2014-05-08 11:32:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How's your morning going?
2014-05-08 11:37:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You busy?
2014-05-08 11:38:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry, I was actually getting waxed haha. Day is going ok, went to target before this 
2014-05-08 11:39:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh alright haha
2014-05-08 11:39:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now going to buy so field supplies
2014-05-08 11:40:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I slept ok, lots of very vivid dreams about cyborgs
2014-05-08 11:40:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Gotta be waxed for the rainforest I guess? Haha
2014-05-08 11:40:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know it's for you 
2014-05-08 11:42:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol cyborgs? Where'd that come from?
2014-05-08 11:43:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess the Star Trek movie we watched? I dunno I've always been prone to really random and slightly fantastical dreams
2014-05-08 11:45:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh yeah. I guess Star Trek was brought up last night. I'm kinda jealous of your fantastical dreams, or at least that you can recall them to some degree.
2014-05-08 11:46:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The only dreams I ever remember are either sexual or upsetting in some way.
2014-05-08 16:18:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is 90 degs outside 
2014-05-08 16:18:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wtf
2014-05-08 16:40:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha wow. That's crazy. Only one more exam until I see you!
2014-05-08 16:40:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We had a tornado warning going off for about 15 minutes during the exam.
2014-05-08 16:40:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Super distracting.
2014-05-08 16:46:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I'm not sure I know what you're saying on Facebook, but I'm kinda over it haha
2014-05-08 17:41:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-05-08 17:42:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]About the literally thing?
2014-05-08 17:42:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yes.
2014-05-08 17:43:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh, yeah that's fine
2014-05-08 17:43:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just putting my 2 cents in lol
2014-05-08 17:43:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I dig. You going to that social?
2014-05-08 17:56:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup in a few
2014-05-08 17:56:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you ace that final?
2014-05-08 17:56:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ha no. Hopefully good enough for an A, though. I guess we'll see.
2014-05-08 18:55:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just thinking about the way you practically sit on top of me when I'm sitting on the couch and it made me smile :)
2014-05-08 19:58:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:))
2014-05-08 20:11:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It makes me really happy that you like that, and don't feel claustrophobic or like I'm too clingy on your space 
2014-05-08 20:16:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah, I love that you want to be that close to me.
2014-05-08 20:31:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're very easy to wrap around I've found
2014-05-08 20:32:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) mannn I'm excited to see you.
2014-05-08 20:44:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It will feel so much closer tomorrow, I'm sure
2014-05-08 20:48:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think once I've move my stuff into storage it'll feel close for me.
2014-05-08 20:53:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will you have a bed to sleep on??
2014-05-08 20:54:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha no. Sleeping bag the last two nights.
2014-05-08 21:32:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll appreciate that hotel room in more ways that one ;)
2014-05-08 21:33:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was planning on appreciating that hotel room more than once.
2014-05-08 21:33:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*already planning
2014-05-08 21:36:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'm not opposed to this plan
2014-05-08 21:36:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might have to plug my fan in tonight
2014-05-08 21:36:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh
2014-05-08 21:37:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Does Darcy have A/C?
2014-05-08 21:38:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She has multiple AC units
2014-05-08 21:38:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which I guess is a plus
2014-05-08 21:39:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For sure. You'll definitely appreciate in the summer, which I guess you won't actually be there for much, haha
2014-05-08 21:39:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well all of August, right,
2014-05-08 21:39:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-05-08 21:40:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah all of August and a tiny bit at the beginning if July
2014-05-08 21:40:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Having sex is gonna be sweaty 
2014-05-08 21:41:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha par for the course then?
2014-05-08 21:42:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Actually the forecast is pretty cool next week, so I guess that's one benefit of it not being nice.
2014-05-08 21:43:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WTF my phone doesn't like it when you make a kiss face apparently. The screenshot effed up again.
2014-05-08 21:43:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can you just send me one? Haha
2014-05-08 21:43:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well we had a thundercloud and high of 72 today and instead in was mostly 90s with zero clouds. So you never know
2014-05-08 21:45:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) thanks
2014-05-08 21:45:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've removed some clothes since the last snap haha
2014-05-08 21:46:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I noticed ;)
2014-05-08 21:47:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*arena chant* sexy snap! Sexy snap! Sexy snap!
2014-05-08 21:47:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Hahahaha
2014-05-08 21:48:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You definitely made me laugh out loud
2014-05-08 21:48:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, I'm glad!
2014-05-08 21:53:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well done :)
2014-05-08 21:59:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha hope it wasn't too much of a tease 
2014-05-08 22:00:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was perfect :)
2014-05-08 22:07:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So how was the social?
2014-05-08 22:07:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, the art was mostly imaging
2014-05-08 22:08:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]EvMorph was pretty boring 
2014-05-08 22:08:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Borrinnggg
2014-05-08 22:08:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sucks.
2014-05-08 22:12:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah the scientific illustration ppl all wished they had submitted something after all
2014-05-08 22:13:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So when we gonna make this Ms. Frizzle roleplaying happen?
2014-05-08 22:14:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!
2014-05-08 22:15:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like role playing comes later 
2014-05-08 22:15:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Once regular sex becomes slightly less exciting
2014-05-08 22:16:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol, I've actually never done any roleplaying. That thought just popped in my head and I thought it was entertaining enough to share.
2014-05-08 22:18:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never really done it either
2014-05-08 22:19:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well isn't that ambiguous ;)
2014-05-08 22:45:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh I guess haha
2014-05-08 23:11:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Justin made it to Montana. I miiight have to visit him. https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-yzv-R3msSJU/U2xVZVz7lUI/AAAAAAAAT6k/Yr3hyYox8mo/s0/2014-05-08
2014-05-08 23:28:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Goodnight, sugar 😘
2014-05-08 23:29:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why are you going to bed so soooon
2014-05-08 23:29:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That picture is amazing
2014-05-08 23:30:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Last day of my UTSW "internship" tomorrow.
2014-05-08 23:30:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh that's right
2014-05-08 23:31:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry if I was distant, got sucked into GoT reading tonight
2014-05-08 23:32:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight! Miss you
2014-05-08 23:33:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha it's all good! I was just looking at the kissy pic, and it's weird how some camera software makes a mirror image for selfies.
2014-05-08 23:34:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Instagram does it and so does Snapchat I think. I don't really like it.
2014-05-08 23:36:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really? I like it much better 
2014-05-08 23:36:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because then it looks like how it does in the screen when I take a pic
2014-05-08 23:37:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why? It's not how the person actually looks.
2014-05-08 23:37:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess I can imagine why that would feel artificial to you 
2014-05-08 23:37:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well it can be mirrored when you take it, but they should flip it when they send it in my opinion.
2014-05-08 23:38:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I flipped your pic in my gallery so it's the proper orientation haha.
2014-05-08 23:38:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send it to me
2014-05-08 23:38:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm curious
2014-05-08 23:38:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And also impressed you could tell the difference
2014-05-08 23:39:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nose ring gives it away. But I bet you could tell with me to if you looked at it close enough.
2014-05-08 23:40:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's how you actually look to me, so I prefer that orientation.
2014-05-08 23:42:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Better?
2014-05-08 23:42:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah :) you're so pretty.
2014-05-08 23:43:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually remember reading something that the reason a lot of people think they look bad in pics is because they're only used to seeing their reflection, so it's more that they look different than what they're used to.
2014-05-08 23:43:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That makes a lot of sense
2014-05-08 23:44:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok I'm gonna try to fall asleep. Sweet dreams, beautiful. Another day closer!
2014-05-08 23:45:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah!
2014-05-09 12:49:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha your face during that boob massage was killing me!
2014-05-09 12:52:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah she usually just does that on my stomach, but I guess decided to get frisky today 
2014-05-09 12:53:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you get to drive to work today?
2014-05-09 12:54:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yep! Why do you ask?
2014-05-09 12:54:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well that's a lot better than public transportation!
2014-05-09 12:57:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's a lot quicker, but much more stressful. How's your day going?
2014-05-09 12:57:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-05-09 12:58:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kind of a slow start, but I'm getting errands done now
2014-05-09 12:58:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My parents put an offer on a house!
2014-05-09 13:00:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No kidding. That's exciting.
2014-05-09 13:05:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The street it's on is called Unicorns Horn
2014-05-09 13:05:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No apostrophe 
2014-05-09 14:29:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that's so goofy. I wonder if other streets in the neighborhood are also named after mystical creatures.
2014-05-09 20:18:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to tonight stud?
2014-05-09 20:25:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Packing like a mofo. I just gave Ajay a ton of shit.
2014-05-09 20:26:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are you up to... what's the female equivalent of stud?
2014-05-09 20:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Babe?
2014-05-09 20:33:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I think so
2014-05-09 20:34:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At the pub with softball ppl
2014-05-09 20:34:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was opening day?
2014-05-09 20:35:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we can talk about it later so you can be social!
2014-05-09 20:36:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright :) I don't think I'll be out late tonight so I'll text you when I'm home
2014-05-09 20:37:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds good. Have fun!
2014-05-09 20:37:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mary Gerhke asked about you, it felt good to brag about it a bit haha
2014-05-09 20:38:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha aw. Well I guess word is officially out once the significant others know about it.
2014-05-09 21:40:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Home and showered

2014-05-10 09:04:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why your back?
2014-05-10 09:05:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Batting practice? 
2014-05-10 09:05:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some arm stuff I did with weights too probably
2014-05-10 09:06:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah. Yeah I guess my lats were usually sore after the first batting practice of the season.
2014-05-10 09:07:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want you to come kiss them and make it feel better 
2014-05-10 09:08:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) two more days and I'll kiss you all over
2014-05-10 09:09:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are your inner thighs sore? ;)
2014-05-10 09:09:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A little bit
2014-05-10 09:09:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-05-10 09:09:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my glutes

2014-05-10 09:10:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-05-10 11:36:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I woke up in the middle of the night with a dream I really really wanted to tell you and thought about texting it then, but I guess fell asleep before I could and now I can't remember it :/
2014-05-10 11:36:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It had to do with juice
2014-05-10 11:40:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha, aw man. I want to know what it was about!
2014-05-10 11:41:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I had texted it, it might have been illegible haha
2014-05-10 11:44:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol yeah most likely.
2014-05-10 13:29:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright, I agree. We should use my car to move stuff between buildings
2014-05-10 13:42:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-05-10 13:42:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made the cardinal mistake of putting all my books in one box
2014-05-10 13:42:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I fixed it
2014-05-10 13:43:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha. Yeah, that's how you throw a back out. We're already done!
2014-05-10 13:45:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woo hoo!
2014-05-10 13:46:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Time to chill by the pool and get excited about seeing my lovely lady.
2014-05-10 13:47:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's me!
2014-05-10 18:09:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So handsome!
2014-05-10 18:11:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have you heard of the "Tip Drill" remix of "E.I."?
2014-05-10 18:12:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, pretty enjoyable I assume? So much Nelly with you lately haha
2014-05-10 18:13:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I was talking about him with Carl recently because he's from Missouri, but you should watch this video. It's completely ridiculous and pure sex.
2014-05-10 18:14:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If a dance party happens while I'm in Chicago I'm putting that shit on for sure.
2014-05-10 18:17:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Carl showed it to me. Apparently it used to get all the girls on the dancefloor.
2014-05-10 18:30:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I'll watch it. I am totally down for helping you engineer some dancing at Tim's party 
2014-05-10 18:34:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'd be awesome!
2014-05-10 18:43:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm playing resident evil 6
2014-05-10 18:48:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know I know, super nerdy
2014-05-10 19:12:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I've never played any of those games. Scary?
2014-05-10 19:13:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The later ones are a little more adventury
2014-05-10 19:14:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Those games don't strike me as particularly nerdy.
2014-05-10 19:14:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm totally naked right now, by the way.
2014-05-10 19:15:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Still hanging with the dudes? 
2014-05-10 19:16:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol that's an interesting follow up question to my message.
2014-05-10 19:18:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A joke 
2014-05-10 19:18:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish I was there!
2014-05-10 19:18:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah. Well sometimes messages are sent nearly simultaneously you know?
2014-05-10 19:19:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too!
2014-05-10 19:22:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I wish I could eat some canes :)
2014-05-10 19:35:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bet you're about to take a sporadic nap haha
2014-05-10 19:50:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah I just took like a half hour long shower, though.
2014-05-10 19:50:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The sit down in the tub kind. Haha
2014-05-10 19:51:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You feeling ok?
2014-05-10 19:52:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah. A little tipsy and a slight headache. But Carl wants to hookah so I'm trying to rally.
2014-05-10 19:52:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hydrate!
2014-05-10 19:52:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you're my best friend.
2014-05-10 19:52:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good idea. I've got some Gatorade!
2014-05-10 19:52:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Water is your best friend :)
2014-05-10 20:02:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that makes me very happy to hear
2014-05-10 20:03:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I think it's a good sign.
2014-05-10 22:02:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My mom just sent me this " Katie's on the reservation now, instead of you. When she checks in they might ask for my name and might ask for her credit card. She won't be charged. Unless you two go wild and order room service! 😃"
2014-05-10 22:02:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what i figured it'd be like, I don't have a problem with that
2014-05-10 22:04:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I'm excited!
2014-05-10 22:05:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So incredibly excited
2014-05-10 22:05:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you make it to hookah?
2014-05-10 22:06:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hookahing right now!
2014-05-10 22:07:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't done this in a while. It's good.
2014-05-10 22:36:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm drinking a YooHoo juice box :)
2014-05-10 22:42:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha. You better keep it under control!
2014-05-10 22:43:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, party animal over hey-a
2014-05-10 23:28:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also I did not put pants on today. Pretty proud of that 
2014-05-10 23:32:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha, I'm proud of you too.
2014-05-10 23:35:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's something I've definitely appreciated in the time we've spent together.
2014-05-10 23:35:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That I never like to wear pants?
2014-05-10 23:36:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which reminds me... you in that storm trooper shirt with no bra... sexy as fuck.
2014-05-10 23:36:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And yes.
2014-05-10 23:37:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I've noticed how much you like that 
2014-05-10 23:38:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You are just really fucking sexy yo

2014-05-10 23:38:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm into every aspect of your body.
2014-05-10 23:39:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're making be blush and become super horny at the same. 
2014-05-10 23:41:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mostly from imagining you copping a feel when I'm wearing that shirt 
2014-05-10 23:43:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love it, man.
2014-05-10 23:43:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah... I need to quit thinking about this right now, lol
2014-05-10 23:43:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can't wait for Monday night
2014-05-10 23:44:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Tuesday morning 
2014-05-10 23:44:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And about 3 times a day after that :)
2014-05-10 23:45:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha yesss
2014-05-10 23:46:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to try to drift off, before I become too sexually frustratedI have to do something about it...goodnight!
2014-05-10 23:46:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're amazing :)
2014-05-10 23:47:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have fun!

2014-05-11 01:53:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh ok. Can I see you for a second?
2014-05-11 01:53:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm
2014-05-11 01:53:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha it's OK.
2014-05-11 01:53:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can I leave the light off and do it on my phone?
2014-05-11 01:54:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha if I'm not passed out in 9 minutes and you're still awake, ill call real quick
2014-05-11 01:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, but we don't have to if you're too tired!
2014-05-11 01:57:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all good. Don't worry about it. Sweet dreams, beautiful.
2014-05-11 10:51:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Clearly I didn't make it, nor did I make it to breakfast 
2014-05-11 10:52:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, I guess you were a sleepy Katie
2014-05-11 10:52:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was totes a sleepy Katie 
2014-05-11 10:53:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my hair looked really really silly when I went to bed
2014-05-11 10:53:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You didn't need to see that
2014-05-11 10:53:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha... now I'm curious
2014-05-11 10:54:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One day, we're not at that stage in our relationship haha
2014-05-11 10:54:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was last night?
2014-05-11 10:55:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was fun
2014-05-11 10:55:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hung out at that hookah lounge for a while
2014-05-11 10:55:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then went to this place called Barcadia, which was pretty cool
2014-05-11 10:55:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they have all these old school arcade games that all cost a quarter
2014-05-11 10:55:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like Donkey Kong, Galaga, Pac-Man, Dig-Dug
2014-05-11 10:56:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Street Fighter II
2014-05-11 10:56:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they had like those oversized Jenga blocks
2014-05-11 10:56:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and an over-sized Connect Four
2014-05-11 10:56:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they were playing some pretty cool music
2014-05-11 10:56:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I liked it
2014-05-11 10:57:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love places like that 
2014-05-11 10:57:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it was fun.
2014-05-11 10:57:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We should go next time you're here.
2014-05-11 10:57:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like a well deserved good time
2014-05-11 10:57:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]After working so much
2014-05-11 10:57:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it felt good!
2014-05-11 10:59:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]only one more night of sleeping apart
2014-05-11 10:59:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, I think that's part of the reason I couldn't sleep well at first 
2014-05-11 11:00:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just kept imagining how much better it'll be in a couple days
2014-05-11 11:01:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where should I go to buy boxes in HP?
2014-05-11 11:01:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]MAN you're adorable
2014-05-11 11:01:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I don't know
2014-05-11 11:01:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I bought four boxes from a place called Boxes to Go in Dallas
2014-05-11 11:01:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-11 11:02:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]couldn't believe a store like that existed
2014-05-11 11:02:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Descriptive title 
2014-05-11 11:02:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We had a 1/2 Off Boxes in Katy
2014-05-11 11:03:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no kidding
2014-05-11 11:03:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]UPS store I guess 
2014-05-11 11:04:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should check Craigslist first
2014-05-11 11:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I picked up a bunch of boxes when I was moving from Chicago by doing that
2014-05-11 11:05:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But aren't boxes like $2 each?
2014-05-11 11:05:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-05-11 11:05:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess if you only need a few you can just buy them
2014-05-11 11:07:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I might do that for this time. There's also something really satisfying about a new box
2014-05-11 11:07:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-11 11:07:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can't say I share that sentiment
2014-05-11 11:07:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Moving got you all jaded! 
2014-05-11 11:07:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can see why though
2014-05-11 11:08:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really feel like I'll probably only be in this place a year
2014-05-11 11:08:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And by that point I'll definitely be over it
2014-05-11 11:09:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-05-11 11:09:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]be over new boxes?
2014-05-11 11:09:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Be over the moving process 
2014-05-11 11:09:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, yeah
2014-05-11 11:12:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm looking forward to living in a semi-grown up place that will not feel super temporary
2014-05-11 11:13:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what this apartment was supposed to be for me 
2014-05-11 11:13:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess I didn't fall in love with living alone quite as much as I thought I would 
2014-05-11 11:14:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I've actually gotten used to it now
2014-05-11 11:14:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to the point I think I would prefer it
2014-05-11 11:15:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm trying to save some money next year
2014-05-11 11:15:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I can visit somebody every now and then
2014-05-11 11:15:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like a lucky somebody :)
2014-05-11 11:16:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might prefer it, if it didn't become a tiny icebox for 6 months...
2014-05-11 11:16:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-11 11:16:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that has more to do with Chicago, though
2014-05-11 11:16:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly
2014-05-11 11:17:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I lived alone in like Miami, with my pool right outside I would been so happy
2014-05-11 11:17:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. Definitely like the fact that you dig pools at least as much as I do.
2014-05-11 11:19:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I posted the shit I was getting rid of on Craigslist saying it was by the dumpster and "Do not contact me. I will not reply."
2014-05-11 11:19:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I've already gotten two emails asking if the stuff is still available
2014-05-11 11:20:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well people don't want to drive all the way out there
2014-05-11 11:20:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unnecessarily 
2014-05-11 11:20:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's free shit
2014-05-11 11:20:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]take the risk
2014-05-11 11:20:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What stuff was it?
2014-05-11 11:20:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]People that hunt the free shit on Craigslist are flaky as fuck
2014-05-11 11:20:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I learned that the hard way in Chicago
2014-05-11 11:21:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Some of those metal stands
2014-05-11 11:21:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a fan
2014-05-11 11:21:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a toaster
2014-05-11 11:21:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a lamp
2014-05-11 11:21:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]shoe stand
2014-05-11 11:21:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]workout pad
2014-05-11 11:21:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I wanted a fan
2014-05-11 11:21:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-11 11:21:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I really really need a shoe stand!
2014-05-11 11:21:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha for real
2014-05-11 11:22:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yess mine is broken 
2014-05-11 11:22:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can check it it's still out there
2014-05-11 11:22:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you know the one I had?
2014-05-11 11:22:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you want that fan too?
2014-05-11 11:22:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The one by the front door?
2014-05-11 11:22:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-05-11 11:22:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If they'll fit in your car ok
2014-05-11 11:22:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they should fit
2014-05-11 11:22:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll check if they're still there
2014-05-11 11:23:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thank you :))
2014-05-11 11:24:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]all gone
2014-05-11 11:24:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sorry
2014-05-11 11:24:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-11 11:24:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]1st the card table to Ajay, now this
2014-05-11 11:25:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well why didn't you ask me what else I was getting rid of then?!
2014-05-11 11:25:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I assumed you told me everything! Cause I was clearly interested in getting some free shit
2014-05-11 11:26:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess the Craigslisters of Dallas rank higher than your girlfriend 
2014-05-11 11:26:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-11 11:26:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I can't believe you don't already have a fan
2014-05-11 11:26:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I figured you already had a shoe stand
2014-05-11 11:26:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I was right about
2014-05-11 11:26:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it just happens to be broken
2014-05-11 11:26:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I only have one fan, and it's like as old as i am from my parents
2014-05-11 11:27:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well hopefully you won't need one in the new place
2014-05-11 11:27:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the whole reason I got rid of mine is because I'm never living in a place without A/C again
2014-05-11 11:27:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-11 11:27:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I need to but a unit
2014-05-11 11:27:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*buy
2014-05-11 11:28:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A window unit
2014-05-11 11:28:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, that's something you can definitely get a good deal on on Craigslist
2014-05-11 11:28:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't say the word right now, I'm still tender about it
2014-05-11 11:29:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm loling
2014-05-11 11:29:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lesson learned, though
2014-05-11 11:29:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-05-11 11:29:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't give away shit without running it by you first
2014-05-11 11:30:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Damn straight. I have my eye on your plates too
2014-05-11 11:30:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-11 11:31:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're a nut
2014-05-11 11:31:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know
2014-05-11 11:31:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright I'm going for a run
2014-05-11 11:31:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gotta shape up for my man
2014-05-11 11:31:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-05-11 13:52:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm going to be driving through thunderstorms the whole time tomorrow :(
2014-05-11 14:03:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]slow driving, but might be kinda epic
2014-05-11 14:03:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just bought this backpack!  http://www.rei.com/product/848380/kelty-coyote-75-pack-womens
2014-05-11 14:05:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awesome! Looks like a good one.
2014-05-11 16:37:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the hotel's not actually downtown.
2014-05-11 16:37:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll pay you back for the cab ride.
2014-05-11 16:38:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah I already found it. It'll be pretty cheap I think 
2014-05-11 16:38:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok, I wasn't sure if you thought it was the one on the river
2014-05-11 16:45:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's the exact name of the hotel again?
2014-05-11 16:46:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I forwarded you the reservation.
2014-05-11 16:47:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It seems like it would not be close to a train station, which is why I offered to cover the cab ride.
2014-05-11 17:01:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might get my family friend to give me a ride
2014-05-11 17:03:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, well if that doesn't work out, I've got you covered    😃 
2014-05-11 17:50:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She got us 2 double beds???
2014-05-11 17:51:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the reservation was made before they knew you were coming
2014-05-11 17:51:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can they change that type of thing?
2014-05-11 17:51:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha when I check in I'll ask
2014-05-11 17:51:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that might be kinda weird to ask my mom I guess
2014-05-11 17:52:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to?
2014-05-11 17:53:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just played GoT board game
2014-05-11 17:53:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And was wrecked
2014-05-11 17:53:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-05-11 17:53:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're pretty hardcore about this GoT stuf
2014-05-11 17:53:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]f
2014-05-11 17:54:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nahhh a group of us just play every weekend
2014-05-11 17:55:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha definitely not hardcore
2014-05-11 17:55:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]while also reading the books and watching the show
2014-05-11 17:56:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's something to do I guess
2014-05-11 20:37:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I test drove a dessert here that I made for you
2014-05-11 20:38:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It got rave reviews 
2014-05-11 20:43:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-05-11 20:44:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm excited! You're so great :)
2014-05-11 21:30:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's your address? I've used up almost all of my data, so I'm going to get another SIM card shipped to you.
2014-05-11 21:31:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]#502 5125 S Kenwood Ave Chicago 60615
2014-05-11 21:34:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah Sundays aren't included in the overnight orders apparently so nevermind.
2014-05-11 21:34:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-05-11 21:35:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Straight Talk has this promotion going where you can overnight a SIM card
2014-05-11 21:35:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it ends tomorrow I guess
2014-05-11 21:35:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you can't overnight stuff on Sundays
2014-05-11 21:36:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hogg
2014-05-11 21:36:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*ohhhh
2014-05-11 21:41:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh I can still do it
2014-05-11 21:55:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I get it
2014-05-11 21:55:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got home
2014-05-11 21:55:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you get what?
2014-05-11 21:56:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're going to overnight it tomorrow?
2014-05-11 21:56:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah...
2014-05-11 21:56:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought I had missed the promotion
2014-05-11 21:56:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I misread something
2014-05-11 21:57:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is why I said "oh I can still do it"
2014-05-11 21:57:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-05-11 22:04:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you been studying? Or do you feel prepared enough
2014-05-11 22:06:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We get a cheat sheet. I could do any of this stuff with enough time to think about it, but I'm not sure how I'll do with the time constraints.
2014-05-11 22:09:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh. That's how chemistry always felt to me
2014-05-11 22:09:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What're you up to now?
2014-05-11 22:09:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*organic
2014-05-11 22:10:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying to clean up a little bit
2014-05-11 22:10:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did not get enough packing in this weekend :/
2014-05-11 22:10:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I feel like those types of exams don't reflect your understanding of the material
2014-05-11 22:10:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I had a feeling that would happen ;)
2014-05-11 22:11:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll be able to help you out at least.
2014-05-11 22:11:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That will be appreciated haha
2014-05-11 22:13:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Holy moley we're getting close!
2014-05-11 22:15:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, thank goodness 
2014-05-11 22:16:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I like the sense of relief that conveyed
2014-05-11 22:17:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ajay's roommate made dinner and we watched Cosmos
2014-05-11 22:17:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm so behind
2014-05-11 22:17:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I gotta find it online
2014-05-11 22:18:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This episode was really good I thought.
2014-05-11 22:18:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They said they toned down the spiciness me haha
2014-05-11 22:18:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eyes didn't water as much? Haha
2014-05-11 22:19:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha no, but my nose was still running!
2014-05-11 22:20:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My allergies have actually been destroying me the past few days.
2014-05-11 22:21:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like it's time to get out of Dallas!
2014-05-11 22:22:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No doubt.
2014-05-11 22:48:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna try to sleep early so I can get up early so I can get my stuff done so I can get on a train to see you!
2014-05-11 22:48:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok!
2014-05-11 22:48:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can't believe only 1 more day
2014-05-11 22:48:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't waiiiiiittttttttt
2014-05-11 23:17:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It feels like Christmas Eve man
2014-05-11 23:18:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha I know!
2014-05-11 23:20:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't stop thinking about all the hugging and kissing and gazing and touching etc. that's gonna happen
2014-05-11 23:21:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe a littllllleee bit of talking too 
2014-05-11 23:21:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I guess if we have to ;)
2014-05-11 23:25:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You have this really adorable smile when we're in bed and cuddling. You have your eyes closed and you'll be all wrapped up in me somehow and you just look super happy and content. I'm looking forward to seeing that face :)
2014-05-11 23:27:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I probably have a pretty similar smile right now
2014-05-11 23:27:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You tell me some of the nicest things anyone's ever said to me
2014-05-11 23:28:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It makes me really happy 
2014-05-11 23:30:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D it makes me really happy to make you happy, so I'll try to keep it up
2014-05-11 23:32:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well since your happy comments about me when I'm happy make me happy, I think we have a nice feedback loop in place haha
2014-05-11 23:34:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I almost said the same thing. Something like "we have a pretty awesome positive feedback loop going here"
2014-05-11 23:35:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Great minds like alike
2014-05-11 23:36:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok I'm gonna try sleep one more time 
2014-05-11 23:36:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-05-11 23:36:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you ever watch Disney's One Saturday Morning?
2014-05-11 23:37:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like Recess and Doug and stuff?
2014-05-11 23:37:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-05-11 23:38:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What about it?
2014-05-11 23:38:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there was this short bit where Genie would talk about important thinkers
2014-05-11 23:38:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it would end with "great minds think alike"
2014-05-11 23:38:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then he would change it in some comedic way to
2014-05-11 23:38:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes!!!!
2014-05-11 23:39:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Great minds think for themselves"
2014-05-11 23:39:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was literally absolutely thinking of that, but not with Genie and I wasn't quite sure where it came for
2014-05-11 23:39:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*from
2014-05-11 23:39:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Holy shit
2014-05-11 23:39:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-11 23:42:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's almost creepy
2014-05-11 23:43:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean I guess that's a pretty widely shared experience by American kids in the late 90s
2014-05-11 23:43:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But still
2014-05-11 23:44:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah I pretty much always think of that segment when I hear people use that phrase
2014-05-11 23:44:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]those cartoons get planted deep in kids' brains, man
2014-05-11 23:51:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just like the sleeper messages in Baby Einsteins
2014-05-11 23:51:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha a pretty mediocre joke. I'm taking my leave. 
2014-05-11 23:51:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah!
2014-05-11 23:52:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Never seen it!
2014-05-11 23:52:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Goodnight, sugar. So excited.
2014-05-12 10:58:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ughh I'm just pacing around my empty apartment. I still have 3 hours until my exam!
2014-05-12 11:02:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'm almost glad I have enough little things to do today to keep me busy
2014-05-12 11:02:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hope you got to sleep in a little!
2014-05-12 11:03:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nope. Been up since a little before 8 haha
2014-05-12 11:10:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Silly
2014-05-12 13:43:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good luck!!
2014-05-12 13:43:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks 😘
2014-05-12 16:23:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you on the road yet??
2014-05-12 16:31:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No. About to catch the bus. I just got wrecked on that exam.
2014-05-12 16:31:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Gonna be a long night.
2014-05-12 16:32:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure the grade won't be as bad as you think!
2014-05-12 16:33:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you're done!! 
2014-05-12 16:33:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No more worrying about school for the next 3 months 
2014-05-12 16:36:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Its all good. That shitty semester is officially behind me and I get to sleep in the same bed as you tonight. I'm feeling good :)
2014-05-12 16:37:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just got your messages after I sent mine!
2014-05-12 16:37:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm on the bus to Union Station.
2014-05-12 16:38:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha Hangouts isn't handling bus to bus texting I guess 
2014-05-12 16:38:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might not be getting in until after three depending on how this weather affects traffic. You should definitely not wait up.
2014-05-12 16:39:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yay!
2014-05-12 16:40:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll try my hardest, but sleep is going to be tough 
2014-05-12 16:40:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a ride to the hotel though!
2014-05-12 16:40:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh great!
2014-05-12 16:41:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So many happy/excited exclamation points in this convo, I like it :)
2014-05-12 16:42:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I'm so excited.
2014-05-12 16:55:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol of course there's ridiculous traffic on Coit. Bus is at a standstill half a mile from my apartment. I've seriously never had this happen to me while riding the bus.
2014-05-12 16:56:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Everything already packed up?
2014-05-12 16:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I just got to get to the car.
2014-05-12 16:58:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The universe seems to be sending a lot of shit my way today. I think it's just jealous.
2014-05-12 16:58:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm stealing all your juju, got a lot of work done today and now I'm getting on the train 
2014-05-12 17:00:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well I'm glad one us is rolling. And that'll mean you can help bring me up to your level later.
2014-05-12 17:01:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna have to be on top the whole time, aren't i? ;)
2014-05-12 17:02:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha maybe
2014-05-12 17:02:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Alright. Heading out!
2014-05-12 17:04:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Be safe!
2014-05-12 19:55:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's rather romantic, us rushing towards each other on different modes of transportation. I feel like I'm in Tom Hanks rom-drama 
2014-05-12 21:21:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely romantic... and I'm definitely gonna be hurting by the time I get there, haha. I think I might want a quick rinse and tooth brushing when I first get there.
2014-05-12 21:24:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I promise not to jump you. And truly, even if we just crawl into bed and pass out immediately I'll be so incredibly happy
2014-05-12 22:55:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) you're amazing
2014-05-12 22:55:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In St. Louis!

2014-05-18 20:58:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you made friends with your roommates? Do you have a big bed?
2014-05-18 21:02:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've met one guy and his girlfriend. I do have a big bed. I think it's bigger than a full.
2014-05-18 21:12:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet
2014-05-18 21:13:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe talk after GoT? 
2014-05-18 21:23:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yes, please!
2014-05-18 21:27:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My dude Alexandre is rocking a bathrobe haha
2014-05-18 21:27:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's what he came to the door in.
2014-05-18 22:24:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I forgot where I packed my charger 
2014-05-18 22:24:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!
2014-05-18 22:24:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And am bordering on exhaustion 
2014-05-18 22:25:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]can I talk to you after your 1st day of work tm?
2014-05-18 22:25:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too. Yeah that's fine.
2014-05-18 22:26:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!
2014-05-18 22:26:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-05-18 22:26:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you. Wish you were in bed with me.
2014-05-18 22:27:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A single bed may be easier if only for that reason 
2014-05-18 22:28:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'd be pretty hard to have my double bed feel half empty without you 
2014-05-18 22:29:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww. Sweet dreams, beautiful 😘
2014-05-19 09:02:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hope you also got a ton of sleep last night. Have an awesome day at work!
2014-05-19 09:02:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go HAM on that ice cream social
2014-05-19 09:37:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also one of the snaps you haven't looked at yet is def #nsfw
2014-05-19 11:37:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Didn't sleep awesome. Probably a little nervous and just a little out of sorts from all the traveling. And I'm looking forward to that snap... I definitely had a Katie daydream moment during one of the orientation presentations.
2014-05-19 11:40:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aw I'm sorry. Some routine in your schedule will probably feel nice after the past month. Don't get too excited about that snap haha, it's more for laughs
2014-05-19 11:43:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm always excited for your snaps :)
2014-05-19 16:21:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahahaha

2014-05-19 16:41:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Shortly after our canoodling 
2014-05-19 16:44:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha, that's amazing
2014-05-19 16:44:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should send me the full-size pic of us on the train so I can put it in my office space    😃 
2014-05-19 19:27:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah that's not the best one to print off, it'll be poor resolution
2014-05-19 19:27:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll take a good one when I visit :)
2014-05-19 19:28:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to dinner now with some people, then Hilary's show at 9. Talk after? I want to hear all about your 1st day!
2014-05-19 19:28:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I found my charger lol
2014-05-19 19:34:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yay! And yeah we can talk later. Just let me know when you're free
2014-05-19 20:01:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Actually, we can just talk tomorrow. You probably won't be home until 11:30 my time.
2014-05-19 20:10:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah, I forgot the time change
2014-05-19 20:10:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Booo

2014-05-19 20:32:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How do I voice call you?

2014-05-20 06:32:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Intentional innuendo on that Facebook comment?
2014-05-20 09:37:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, just a joke. Cause you know, you really like me, thats why you drove so much to Chicago 
2014-05-20 09:37:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How is pizza an innuendo? 
2014-05-20 09:45:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha it's not.
2014-05-20 09:46:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It almost seemed like an inside joke the way you phrased it, like deep dish pizza was a euphemism.
2014-05-20 09:47:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I guess it could be ;)
2014-05-20 17:48:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]honeyyyyyy
2014-05-20 18:25:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whattttttt

2014-05-20 19:37:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miss you
2014-05-20 19:37:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to tonight?
2014-05-20 19:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not much. Making some leftover spaghetti.
2014-05-20 19:37:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What about you?
2014-05-20 19:39:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nom. I gotta work some more, getting a little stressed....
2014-05-20 19:40:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man :( just a lot to finish up?
2014-05-20 19:43:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Emailing people, a presentation for the ots class, and a grant 
2014-05-20 19:43:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]zoinks, that is a lot
2014-05-20 19:48:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I know you'll get everything done, it just might not be pleasant. I wish I could be there to help ease some of your stress. I love you.
2014-05-20 20:12:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you too, thanks for that. 
2014-05-20 20:12:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though if you were here I would def be even less inclined to get any work done :)
2014-05-20 20:13:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah we might have to figure out a way to balance the whole work/love life thing in the future
2014-05-20 20:44:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll just start farting in front of you, end the romance really quick haha
2014-05-20 20:46:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha, yeah that'd probably do the trick
2014-05-20 21:37:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On my way home
2014-05-20 21:38:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's pouringggg
2014-05-20 21:38:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]making you wet?    😉 
2014-05-20 21:38:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh nooooo
2014-05-20 21:39:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I am wearing a white Tshirt...
2014-05-20 21:39:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmmm that could be sexy
2014-05-20 21:42:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So many cliches lol
2014-05-20 21:42:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-05-20 21:42:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Rainy weather cliches
2014-05-20 21:43:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wet t-shirt and??
2014-05-20 21:44:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Making you wet"
2014-05-20 21:44:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Come on, you're not the 1st guy to make that joke ;)
2014-05-20 21:45:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never used it or heard it before.
2014-05-20 21:45:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess I'm not an attractive lady either
2014-05-20 21:45:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wanna video a little when I'm home? Or is it almost past your big boy bedtime?
2014-05-20 21:45:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can video a bit
2014-05-20 22:45:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.rei.com
2014-05-20 22:55:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]love you!
2014-05-20 22:55:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!
2014-05-20 22:55:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!
2014-05-20 22:56:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-05-21 08:29:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good morning lovah
2014-05-21 08:46:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good morning, sugar. I love being in love with you. It feels so good :)
2014-05-21 08:53:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]D'aww. I did something regrettable last night...
2014-05-21 08:58:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You may never see me the same way again
2014-05-21 09:05:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's that?
2014-05-21 09:06:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I couldn't beat the special pvz2 level, and every time you replay it it costs 1,000 coins.
2014-05-21 09:06:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I paid $6 for  more  coins
2014-05-21 09:07:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And still didn't beat it
2014-05-21 09:07:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm ashamed of myself
2014-05-21 09:08:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha. You're right, I don't think I will ever see you the same way again.
2014-05-21 09:08:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're a nut.
2014-05-21 17:31:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's it goin?
2014-05-21 17:32:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good. How are you doing?
2014-05-21 17:33:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Long day you said?
2014-05-21 17:34:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, but not utterly unproductive
2014-05-21 17:34:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Turns out I already had Hep A vaccine
2014-05-21 17:35:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mother just looked at the wrong paper
2014-05-21 17:35:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well that's good
2014-05-21 17:36:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I video conferenced with the dudes I'm going to be working with over the summer.
2014-05-21 17:36:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We're a very beard-y bunch.
2014-05-21 17:37:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha oh no, more justification for a beard
2014-05-21 17:37:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Gotta fit in!
2014-05-21 17:39:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are you doing for the rest of the afternoon/evening?
2014-05-21 17:41:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] I'm gonna work on campus for another hour or so, then start unpacking boxes to find all the shit I need
2014-05-21 17:41:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You?
2014-05-21 17:42:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not much
2014-05-21 17:43:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My field season dates have possibly changed dramatically.
2014-05-21 17:43:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? To when?
2014-05-21 17:43:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can talk about it later, but I may have some free time in July after all
2014-05-21 17:43:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet!
2014-05-21 17:43:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hopefully not at the cost of time in August?
2014-05-21 17:51:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ehhh we'll see. I might not get to Chicago until like the 11, but if you beat me by a few days I'm sure you can find something to entertain yourself :)
2014-05-21 17:52:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll also be flying to washington straight from Raleigh, which will be interesting
2014-05-21 17:52:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So you aren't driving to Evolution anymore?
2014-05-21 17:53:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably not, unless we drive up and they drive my car back 
2014-05-21 17:53:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-05-21 17:54:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's cool
2014-05-21 17:54:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm definitely down with trading a couple days in August for some face time in July
2014-05-21 17:59:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I figured you would be. Though it might have to involve you flying to meet me somewhere as I think I'm gonna have to fund everything myself this summer and just hope to get reimbursed one day
2014-05-21 17:59:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So $$$ might be a little tight until the Fall paycheck 
2014-05-21 18:00:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh really?
2014-05-21 18:00:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What happened with the Hinds fund?
2014-05-21 18:01:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't heard about it yet, and unless they give me a travel advance the 3 days I'm here in June even if I do get Hinds money I probably can't get to it until August
2014-05-21 18:02:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, bummer
2014-05-21 18:02:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Field seasons I guess often work this way though, Shane said he needs over 3000 in reimbursements
2014-05-21 18:02:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dang!
2014-05-21 18:02:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a lot.
2014-05-21 18:03:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'm sure I could fly out to ya
2014-05-21 18:04:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I suppose the earlier you know where you're gonna be the better
2014-05-21 18:05:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you'll be the 1st to know
2014-05-21 18:05:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-05-21 18:06:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok I'm gonna hunker down and work
2014-05-21 18:07:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll talk to you later!
2014-05-21 18:08:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]alright. Kick ass, sugar!

2014-05-21 18:08:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ugh, I've already forgotten how to kiss you
2014-05-21 18:08:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the saddest thing I've ever heard
2014-05-21 18:08:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you need to come back and remine me :)
2014-05-21 18:09:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]27 days! I love you.
2014-05-21 18:25:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a grammar question
2014-05-21 18:25:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Collecting will occur in July and August, with at least 10 individuals sampled each from 14 populations of O. lurida, six naturalized populations of C. gigas, and four nursery broodstocks of C. gigas
2014-05-21 18:25:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]where does the "each" go
2014-05-21 18:25:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or is it unnecessay?
2014-05-21 18:29:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]During July and August, I will collect 10 individuals from each of my target populations (14 populations of O. lurida, six naturalized populations of C. gigas, and four nursery broodstocks of C. gigas).
2014-05-21 18:29:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That might be how I'd phrase it.
2014-05-21 18:31:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]During July and August, I will collect 10 individuals from each target population
2014-05-21 18:31:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's better
2014-05-21 18:31:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like it
2014-05-21 18:32:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]. ‪During July and August, I will collect 10 individuals from each target population, sampling 14 populations of O. lurida, six naturalized populations of C. gigas, and four nursery broodstocks of C. gigas
2014-05-21 18:32:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice!
2014-05-21 18:33:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]thanks babe
2014-05-21 18:33:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-05-21 19:32:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm already over the whole pants wearing thing
2014-05-21 19:32:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha, I bet
2014-05-21 19:38:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Darcy's proposal talk is tm, so she's pretty stressed I think
2014-05-21 19:39:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]some Katie booty always makes my day, maybe that's just what she needs?
2014-05-21 20:44:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha perhaps, though you may be biased
2014-05-21 20:44:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just talked to Elin for an hour which was really nice
2014-05-21 20:45:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, that's good.
2014-05-21 20:45:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Talkin' about life and shit?
2014-05-21 20:45:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup, lots of life and shit
2014-05-21 20:45:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Talked about her and justin meeting up lol
2014-05-21 20:46:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh yeah?
2014-05-21 20:46:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure he'd be down.
2014-05-21 20:47:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if we do get to go to Montana sometime, they're like an hour away from each other. 
2014-05-21 20:47:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we should definitely go
2014-05-21 20:47:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd actually be sick to be there for the Perseids, but it sounds like that probably can't happen
2014-05-21 20:48:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!!!!
2014-05-21 20:50:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm definitely watching those with you regardless.
2014-05-21 20:50:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good    😃 
2014-05-21 20:51:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe some kind of meet up in Missoula can happen? I fly there from LA and you fly there from Chicago?
2014-05-21 20:51:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh we'll have to wait and see I guess 
2014-05-21 20:51:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, but that doesn't sound like a possibility
2014-05-21 20:51:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean does
2014-05-21 20:52:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-05-21 20:52:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the second time I've done something like that
2014-05-21 20:52:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not really sure how that happens
2014-05-21 20:52:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Auto correct?
2014-05-21 20:52:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no I'm on my computer
2014-05-21 20:53:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]same thing last time
2014-05-21 20:53:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]auto correct in my brain
2014-05-21 20:53:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or auto-pessimist I guess
2014-05-21 20:54:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha gotta shake off that inner negativity!
2014-05-21 20:54:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've done 0 packing since getting home
2014-05-21 20:54:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know! I really feel like I have been, though. I feel more positive now than I have in maybe my whole life.
2014-05-21 20:54:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-21 20:54:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess an hour on the phone will do that!
2014-05-21 20:56:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Look at these creepy bruises
2014-05-21 20:56:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are they from?
2014-05-21 20:56:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A demon
2014-05-21 20:56:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have no idea 
2014-05-21 20:57:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty weird
2014-05-21 20:57:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't bruise
2014-05-21 20:58:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you seem like you might bruise easily
2014-05-21 20:58:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Any particular reason you feel so positive?  ☺️
2014-05-21 20:59:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'd say it's about 70% you 30% career stuff
2014-05-21 20:59:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll take it
2014-05-21 21:05:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm mentioning how we met in an email to my friend Mary
2014-05-21 21:05:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's just kinda crazy to think about
2014-05-21 21:05:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess any two people meeting is wild
2014-05-21 21:05:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when you consider all the things that led up to that point
2014-05-21 21:06:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess in our case it seems particularly serendipitous
2014-05-21 21:06:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess maybe just because the things that happened are so recent and obvious
2014-05-21 21:11:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well and also I think required some extra fortuitousness
2014-05-21 21:11:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And very specific decisions 
2014-05-21 21:12:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess the fact that I can sort of pinpoint several major events/decisions that led to us meeting and then getting together is what makes it interesting
2014-05-21 21:12:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that just seemed sort of random at the time
2014-05-21 21:12:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not seemed random
2014-05-21 21:13:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]were essentially random
2014-05-21 21:13:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That were not done with the intentions of finding some 
2014-05-21 21:13:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]exactly
2014-05-21 21:14:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like when you ask someone you go to school with or work with on a date, that's a decision more directly linked to you starting to see each other
2014-05-21 21:14:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For our situation, I think we had to be really exceptionally compatible for this to ever happen
2014-05-21 21:15:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt
2014-05-21 21:15:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't have even entertained the thought otherwise
2014-05-21 21:22:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wanna video in a bit? 
2014-05-21 21:23:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]obv
2014-05-21 21:26:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you seen the video for "Turn Down for What"

2014-05-22 00:07:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't beat it
2014-05-22 07:00:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not mad, just disappointed.
2014-05-22 08:10:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha if you were mad that'd be too much to handle 
2014-05-22 14:00:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can we just spend all night together online, fall asleep with our computer screens up?
2014-05-22 14:00:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or have it open while we each do work?
2014-05-22 14:01:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The thought of not seeing your face is getting to me
2014-05-22 14:34:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's the goddamn sweetest thing I've ever heard.
2014-05-22 14:35:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But yeah, we can do that. I can't do it while I'm at work, but while I'm home I can.
2014-05-22 14:50:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now!
2014-05-22 14:50:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to see you now!
2014-05-22 14:51:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'm actually out shopping, but I'll see you when you get home. Mwah
2014-05-22 17:39:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's only been five days and I'm already sick of the no sex thing.
2014-05-22 18:34:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]dude, I went through withdrawals 3 days ago
2014-05-22 18:34:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha yeah?
2014-05-22 18:37:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]on top of not being able to pleasure myself, its been rough...
2014-05-22 18:37:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can't do it in your room?
2014-05-22 18:39:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I probably could've
2014-05-22 18:39:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I've also been busy
2014-05-22 18:39:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and it would've probably just ended in more frustration haha
2014-05-22 18:40:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What have you been up to today?
2014-05-22 18:42:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]set up the MacBook Air I'm taking
2014-05-22 18:43:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]finished that grant for the Pritzker lab
2014-05-22 18:43:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]went to REI and spent wayyyyy too much money
2014-05-22 18:43:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and sat in rush hour traffic alot
2014-05-22 18:44:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]funnn

2014-05-22 19:51:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My computer died...
2014-05-22 19:51:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-05-22 19:54:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you already switch out of windows? It's ok if you did, we don't have to use Skype anymore 
2014-05-22 19:54:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no I'm still in Windows.
2014-05-22 19:55:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It looks like I had closed out of Skype
2014-05-22 19:58:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you want to video still?
2014-05-22 19:59:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes I had to restart my computer
2014-05-22 19:59:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The internet wasn't connecting
2014-05-22 19:59:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-05-22 20:05:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think the internet is messed up
2014-05-22 20:05:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I don't know where the router is
2014-05-22 20:06:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, bummer
2014-05-22 20:09:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The DSL light is blinking red
2014-05-22 20:10:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What does that mean?
2014-05-22 20:10:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd unplug it for a bit then plug it back in
2014-05-22 20:11:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-05-22 20:12:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Btw

2014-05-22 20:12:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a lot
2014-05-22 20:56:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bad timing!
2014-05-22 21:04:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry I was a bit defensive today 
2014-05-22 21:04:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No worries, hon!
2014-05-22 21:04:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like that you defend yourself.
2014-05-22 21:05:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was mostly worried you were gonna hate me.
2014-05-22 21:08:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha never.
2014-05-22 21:08:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you and miss you like crazy. Enjoy the movie!
2014-05-22 21:10:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah 
2014-05-22 23:28:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The movie was pretty entertaining 
2014-05-22 23:28:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And appropriately silly

2014-05-23 12:18:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you. I hope you're really excited. I'm excited for you!
2014-05-23 19:10:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think my banjo is not good.
2014-05-23 23:32:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Reinstalled hangouts
2014-05-23 23:32:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In Costa Rica?!
2014-05-23 23:32:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In my hotel, flight was unevenful
2014-05-23 23:33:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They have dope ketchup here!
2014-05-23 23:33:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, how so?
2014-05-23 23:33:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why aren't your messages in Spanish?
2014-05-23 23:33:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's basically watered down marinara
2014-05-23 23:33:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are they getting translated as they cross the border?
2014-05-23 23:33:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sounds gross
2014-05-23 23:33:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The vinegar is what makes it ketchup
2014-05-23 23:34:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I loveeeee marinara 
2014-05-23 23:34:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean... I like it
2014-05-23 23:34:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you want that on your fries and burgers?
2014-05-23 23:34:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-05-23 23:34:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha ok
2014-05-23 23:34:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish I could have it on almost everything
2014-05-23 23:34:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm loling
2014-05-23 23:35:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry your banjo is no good
2014-05-23 23:36:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But maybe it's operator error?
2014-05-23 23:36:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all good. I think I'll buy a new one with my first paycheck.
2014-05-23 23:36:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah, the high G string uses a "friction" tuning peg
2014-05-23 23:36:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is apparently a common thing with cheap banjos
2014-05-23 23:37:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they are really shitty
2014-05-23 23:37:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and don't hold their tune well
2014-05-23 23:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I already knew that
2014-05-23 23:37:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I had been able to tighten it before
2014-05-23 23:37:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but now it doesn't tighten at all
2014-05-23 23:37:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the high G string is always loose
2014-05-23 23:37:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and out of tune
2014-05-23 23:38:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who needs high notes anyways
2014-05-23 23:38:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha banjos do, it's what gives it that banjo sound
2014-05-23 23:39:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm obviously in undergrad housing, loud music in the area
2014-05-23 23:39:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Such a grumpy old guy lol
2014-05-23 23:39:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's Friday on a holiday weekend! Give the kiddos a break
2014-05-23 23:40:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was that grumpy?
2014-05-23 23:40:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not grumpy
2014-05-23 23:41:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But still a sign of your age

2014-05-24 00:38:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP](I couldn't sleep)
2014-05-24 00:39:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Damn!
2014-05-24 00:40:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll still get to see the stars, which will make me happy.
2014-05-24 00:40:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you see any now?
2014-05-24 00:40:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Even the sky where I am staying is a lot darker than Dallas or Chicago, which is nice.
2014-05-24 00:40:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]any meteors?
2014-05-24 00:40:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you're awake you should go outside around 2
2014-05-24 00:41:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can stay up
2014-05-24 00:41:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's only 20 minutes away

2014-05-24 00:42:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1:40
2014-05-24 00:42:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm in a different time zone than I thought
2014-05-24 00:42:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Mountain?
2014-05-24 00:42:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I guess that explains why the flight felt so long
2014-05-24 00:42:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah it's 11:42 here
2014-05-24 00:42:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-05-24 00:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm, that could make communicating even more difficult
2014-05-24 00:43:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good
2014-05-24 00:43:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aww don't be such a Debby Downer

2014-05-24 00:46:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And they quadrupled
2014-05-24 00:46:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol you're goofy

2014-05-24 00:48:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I googled meteor shower cause I remembered my mom had said there would be one at the end of May
2014-05-24 00:49:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it was the 1st one that popped up
2014-05-24 00:49:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]makes sense
2014-05-24 00:50:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's probably too bright here
2014-05-24 00:52:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've gotta believe!
2014-05-24 00:52:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok now I'm sleepy for real. Glad we cleared up the time zone thing. Night boo. Tell me how the  🌠  are

2014-05-24 16:12:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The bus ride was good, pretty nice bus but I was on top of the wheel and really squished for the 6 hrs
2014-05-24 16:13:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, bummer
2014-05-24 16:13:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The scenery was amazing though!

2014-05-24 16:14:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're in the south part of the country about 3000km up in the mountains 
2014-05-24 16:14:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lots of breathtaking mountain foresty views 
2014-05-24 16:14:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think you're 3000 km up
2014-05-24 16:14:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]3000m haha
2014-05-24 16:15:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]3km

2014-05-24 16:15:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is a whole other kind of humid though
2014-05-24 16:15:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, my hair
2014-05-24 16:15:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha

2014-05-24 16:17:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀

2014-05-24 18:32:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should pick a flight that gets in in the evening in that case, though
2014-05-24 18:32:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]at 7:15 on the 18
2014-05-24 18:32:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]woo!

2014-05-24 18:34:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:(
2014-05-24 18:34:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]booooo
2014-05-24 18:37:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]5 nights
2014-05-24 18:37:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]aint terrible
2014-05-24 18:38:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope. I'll definitely be craving some Katie time by then too.
2014-05-24 18:46:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you're not craving some Katie time already?
2014-05-24 18:46:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm offended
2014-05-24 18:46:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what did you do today?
2014-05-24 18:53:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]of course I'm craving some Katie time. I was craving some Katie time the minute I left.
2014-05-24 18:53:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mailed my sister's boyfriend her parking sticker.
2014-05-24 18:54:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]watched a bunch of data science/machine learning videos
2014-05-24 18:54:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just took a shower
2014-05-24 18:55:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I totally fantasize about just coming home from work and being able to have dinner with you
2014-05-24 18:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]am I cooking the dinner in this fantasy? I had no idea you were so sexist ;)
2014-05-24 18:59:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would love to obviously though
2014-05-24 19:01:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha no we'd make it together!
2014-05-24 19:09:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Although you making dinner on summer heels and nothing else might be a real macho fantasy lol.
2014-05-24 20:05:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hahaha I'll keep that in mind
2014-05-24 20:20:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are you up to? Been asked out on any dates yet? ;)
2014-05-24 22:20:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm reading that article you recommended to me a while back. I really like this quote  “And the first Morning of Creation wrote / What the Last Dawn of Reckoning shall read.” 
2014-05-24 22:32:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That was a good read. Thanks for the recommendation.
2014-05-24 23:37:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what article was that?
2014-05-24 23:38:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and the course is 13 females, 3 males, and 90% of everyone is married
2014-05-24 23:39:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so the dating prospects are looking slim
2014-05-24 23:40:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we had dinner at 6, an organizational meeting at 7:30p, and then some of us went to the bar a little ways down the road
2014-05-24 23:41:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]which seems to service only OTS and the adjacent inn lol
2014-05-24 23:42:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ohhh the deterministic one
2014-05-24 23:44:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah I had high hopes for the other articles in that chapter, but they're touch and go.
2014-05-24 23:46:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]goodnight my love
2014-05-25 07:59:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That gender ratio and marriage ratio is pretty interesting.
2014-05-25 08:19:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well the gender ratio is reflective of grad school biology in general 
2014-05-25 08:20:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I never noticed.
2014-05-25 08:21:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I guess a fair amount of people here are older/took time off before grad school so that's the marriage thing
2014-05-25 08:21:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's only 1 other person who's 22
2014-05-25 08:21:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*23
2014-05-25 08:22:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. You're up early. About to start the day?
2014-05-25 08:22:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Breakfast is at 6:30
2014-05-25 08:23:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And by 6:15 the birds are SO LOUD you kinda have to get up
2014-05-25 08:23:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that's kinda awesome. The birds are actually pretty loud here too around 5:30.
2014-05-25 08:24:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I saw an agouti!
2014-05-25 08:26:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet! You might see a bunch of those right?
2014-05-25 08:38:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I guess they're pretty common around the garden 
2014-05-25 15:47:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to today?
2014-05-25 19:01:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you're camping?
2014-05-25 19:02:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have free time the rest of the night, if you are at home and want to video a little. Otherwise hope you're having a blast with nature! Mwah
2014-05-26 08:32:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey, sugar. I was planning on messaging you when I got to the park, but I didn't have service for at least the last hour of my drive including at the park.
2014-05-26 08:32:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I even had the message thought up
2014-05-26 08:32:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"I'm about to go off the grid for the next ~24 hours. If you don't hear from me by Monday evening, I probably died a slow painful death. I fully expect you to never move on... building a shrine might be appropriate. I love you! Have a fun couple of days."
2014-05-26 08:33:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I felt pretty bad about not messaging you... I know you probably don't care, but it's the kind of thing that would've probably made me a little upset.
2014-05-26 08:33:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll make sure to message you before I leave in the future.
2014-05-26 08:33:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was fun, though. I thought about you a lot.
2014-05-26 08:34:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm really lucky to have you in my life... miss you a bunch. I hope you're having an awesome time!
2014-05-26 08:37:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No worries! I wasn't upset at all, though I admit my mind sometimes has a morbid tendency and I thought you might've slipped in the shower and cracked your head open and was in the hospital and no one thought to contact me....
2014-05-26 08:37:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-26 08:37:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope
2014-05-26 08:38:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually really need a shower
2014-05-26 08:38:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I smell bad
2014-05-26 08:38:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmmm
2014-05-26 08:38:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm about to go to class, but I want to hear all about your trip later! 
2014-05-26 08:39:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you 
2014-05-26 08:39:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good. I love you too!
2014-05-26 13:41:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What are your plans today?
2014-05-26 13:42:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lie around
2014-05-26 13:42:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you?
2014-05-26 13:42:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's probably lunchtime?
2014-05-26 13:42:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, we have 12-1:30 for lunch break
2014-05-26 13:42:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-05-26 13:42:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you eat?
2014-05-26 13:43:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then class until about 5:30, then stuff 7-8:30
2014-05-26 13:43:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There a dining hall of sorts that puts out family style meals at tables of 8. 
2014-05-26 13:44:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've been eating lots of veggies and really tasty seasoned chicken
2014-05-26 13:44:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice, that sounds good!
2014-05-26 13:44:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But COsta Ricans are a little too liberal with cilantro
2014-05-26 13:45:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, man. Bummer.
2014-05-26 13:45:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you think the soap-cilantro gene has different frequencies in different ethniciites?
2014-05-26 13:46:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It seems like cilantro wouldn't be a staple in a diet if a high enough % of the population had that gene
2014-05-26 13:47:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I effing love cilantro, though so that sounds delish
2014-05-26 13:47:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's at very low frequency even in the United States, but it's very possible it's a European thing
2014-05-26 13:47:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's what I was thinking
2014-05-26 13:47:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to do that 23andMe thing one day 
2014-05-26 13:47:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think everyone should do it, hahaha
2014-05-26 13:48:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]too man has
2014-05-26 13:48:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was only a two ha comment
2014-05-26 13:48:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was barely even a 2 ha comment
2014-05-26 13:48:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Calm down dude
2014-05-26 13:48:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-26 13:48:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]harsh!
2014-05-26 13:48:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just joking!
2014-05-26 13:49:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my threshold for two has is very low
2014-05-26 13:49:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or laughing in general
2014-05-26 13:49:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, I like that about you
2014-05-26 13:49:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aww    😃 
2014-05-26 13:49:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The actual laughing part 
2014-05-26 13:49:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It means my lame jokes finally have an audience!
2014-05-26 13:50:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha glad I can be of service!
2014-05-26 13:50:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I dreamed I caught an Ambystoma last night
2014-05-26 13:51:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nerdin out
2014-05-26 13:51:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I also dreamed my old house in Berlin Heights (it wasn't actually my old house, it just "felt" like it, you know?) had this weird water collecting structure behind it
2014-05-26 13:51:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was so strange
2014-05-26 13:51:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was like a temple
2014-05-26 13:51:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wonder why you remembered those dreams better than you usually do?
2014-05-26 13:51:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I didn't sleep well
2014-05-26 13:52:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I woke up with a raging headache at about 2:00 AM
2014-05-26 13:52:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I slept fine after that
2014-05-26 13:52:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You didn't hydrate!
2014-05-26 13:52:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I drank three 32 oz Gatorades
2014-05-26 13:52:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-26 13:52:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Okkkk, so you consumed way way too much sugar
2014-05-26 13:53:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, pretty sure it was just being in the sun and the strenuous activity
2014-05-26 13:53:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]generally does the trick on me
2014-05-26 13:53:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And sugar
2014-05-26 13:53:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry you had a headache though :/
2014-05-26 13:53:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sugar doesn't cause hangovers according to this Wired article Mark Westneat tweeted
2014-05-26 13:54:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh wait
2014-05-26 13:54:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it does
2014-05-26 13:54:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-05-26 13:54:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]losing sugar doesn't cause hangovers
2014-05-26 13:54:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so maybe that was the case!
2014-05-26 13:54:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm still skeptical
2014-05-26 13:55:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can eat a bunch of cake and candy and not get a headache
2014-05-26 13:55:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gatorade is actually poorer for hydration unless you are really going through electrolytes at athletic training level
2014-05-26 13:55:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but playing a few hard games of pickup basketball will
2014-05-26 13:55:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was sweating a lot
2014-05-26 13:55:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty sore today
2014-05-26 13:55:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd consider it strenuous
2014-05-26 13:58:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I peed once yesterday soooo I wasn't losing water.
2014-05-26 13:58:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Except through sweat.
2014-05-26 13:58:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Peeing once after 124oz of Gatorade is not comforting 
2014-05-26 13:58:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I never had to go
2014-05-26 13:59:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*108
2014-05-26 14:00:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder how hard the exercise has to be?
2014-05-26 14:00:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because Gatorade is definitely better for like football/basketball
2014-05-26 14:00:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think the bigger point is one bottle is ok, but no one ever needs that much at the actual concentration of Gatorade
2014-05-26 14:01:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I always water my gatorades down 
2014-05-26 14:01:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that true?
2014-05-26 14:01:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this bottle of Gatorade has 17.5% of your daily sodium
2014-05-26 14:01:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's for an average of 2000 calorie diet
2014-05-26 14:01:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And how much sugar?
2014-05-26 14:02:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which doesn't account for strenuous activity
2014-05-26 14:02:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]same
2014-05-26 14:02:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You get more than enough sodium from everything else you consume during the day 
2014-05-26 14:03:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a quick way to deliver some to offset sweating
2014-05-26 14:03:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To offset a rapid loss of electrolytes 
2014-05-26 14:03:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-05-26 14:03:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]isn't that the context here?
2014-05-26 14:03:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes?
2014-05-26 14:04:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha what's the debate then?
2014-05-26 14:04:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My "that much" was 3 36 oz bottles
2014-05-26 14:05:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well, I think there's two debates happening maybe
2014-05-26 14:05:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one is the cause of my headache
2014-05-26 14:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the other is whether I had too much Gatorade
2014-05-26 14:05:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I had too much Gatorade
2014-05-26 14:06:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and based on my previous history of strenuous activity giving me headaches (possibly migraines), I disagree with that assertion as well
2014-05-26 14:07:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this debate has probably run its course lol
2014-05-26 14:07:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I get my last say!
2014-05-26 14:07:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-05-26 14:09:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]1) Multiple things associated with strenuous activity can cause your headaches, and it's very likely they have to do with hydration and your diet. And maybe light/sun in your eyes. 2) you definitely drank way more Gatorade than you needed or probably should've, regardless if it was the cause of the headache.
2014-05-26 14:09:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]3) sorry that my nagging resulted in this obnoxious debate lol
2014-05-26 14:09:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no worries
2014-05-26 14:10:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I have an issue with your use of "needed" vs. "should've"
2014-05-26 14:10:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but we can leave it alone
2014-05-26 14:10:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I knew you would with should've
2014-05-26 14:10:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-05-26 14:10:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you    😃 
2014-05-26 14:10:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you too
2014-05-26 14:11:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you been learning a lot?
2014-05-26 14:11:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's only day 2?
2014-05-26 14:11:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is so much fucking work
2014-05-26 14:12:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh really?
2014-05-26 14:12:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We've covered like 5 weeks worth of PopGen already lol. And the 3 papers we have to read every night are pretty long.
2014-05-26 14:13:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But the teachers are really good, though a tiny bit outdated on some methods
2014-05-26 14:13:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-05-26 14:13:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sounds intense, though
2014-05-26 14:13:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when you first told me your schedule, I had a feeling that'd be the case
2014-05-26 14:13:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]6:30-8 is brutal
2014-05-26 14:14:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah me too, but in practice it's pretty exhausting 
2014-05-26 14:14:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then I guess reading after that
2014-05-26 14:14:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure
2014-05-26 14:14:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the reason the time difference worried me a bit
2014-05-26 14:14:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I figure you'll be zonking out early
2014-05-26 14:14:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess it's better in that case then?
2014-05-26 14:15:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I think so
2014-05-26 14:15:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]assuming you have any free time
2014-05-26 14:15:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you mean better?
2014-05-26 14:15:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you were ahead of me say
2014-05-26 14:15:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]by two hours
2014-05-26 14:15:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and were going to bed at 10
2014-05-26 14:15:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd only be 8 my time
2014-05-26 14:16:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'd probably be missing you
2014-05-26 14:16:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if you go to bed at 10 now, that's midnight my time
2014-05-26 14:16:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so we're more on the same schedule-ish I guess
2014-05-26 14:16:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*sleeping schedule
2014-05-26 14:16:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's assuming you're going for 8 hours of sleep
2014-05-26 14:16:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I don't really expect to be the case, haha
2014-05-26 14:17:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You go to bed before midnight though, right? 
2014-05-26 14:17:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah right about midnight
2014-05-26 14:17:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get up at 8
2014-05-26 14:17:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might start showering at night and wake up a few minutes later too
2014-05-26 14:18:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or mixing it up maybe
2014-05-26 14:19:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well, I'll let you know the next time I might have a chance to video
2014-05-26 14:20:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-05-26 14:20:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but it would probably be after 8:30 my time some night
2014-05-26 14:20:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that'd work for me
2014-05-26 14:21:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i went into town yesterday with a woman from the program to buy some booze
2014-05-26 14:21:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but when we got back everyone was reading and then got too tired to hang
2014-05-26 14:21:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I feel like that will be a trend
2014-05-26 14:22:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I was about to say...
2014-05-26 14:22:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, I still drank my boxed wine lol
2014-05-26 14:22:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd be wrecked if I drank and had to do a day like yours
2014-05-26 14:22:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you're a champ
2014-05-26 14:22:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or an alcoholic?
2014-05-26 14:22:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd be wrecked if I didn't have a drink to look forward to after
2014-05-26 14:23:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]soooo maybe just a grad student?
2014-05-26 14:23:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha same thing
2014-05-26 14:23:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]alright, 4 more hours of class

2014-05-26 14:24:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to know about all hose little animals in your pics

2014-05-26 17:54:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What website can I watch the heat on?
2014-05-26 17:55:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://xn--frstrowsports-39b.eu/
2014-05-26 17:55:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]click on "BASKETBALL" once the game starts and it should be there
2014-05-26 17:55:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can try to find you a better stream once the game starts
2014-05-26 18:41:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I sent you a Google Doc of my Morrow Mountain summary. You have contact permissions if you want to say something    😃 
2014-05-26 18:59:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright, I'll read it after dinner!

2014-05-26 19:01:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cute!
2014-05-26 19:06:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When I got that sequence of messages on my phone, the picture wasn't included in the notification, so I thought you were saying you were having baby agouti for dinner!
2014-05-26 19:31:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So tender
2014-05-26 19:36:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://cfltesthd6.moonfruit.com/

2014-05-26 19:40:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]boo
2014-05-26 19:41:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I can get myself to root for the Heat on your behalf
2014-05-26 19:41:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]eh i guess I'll see some of the 2nd half
2014-05-26 19:41:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's ok
2014-05-26 19:41:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]just don't trash them too much
2014-05-26 19:41:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and don't root for the spurs
2014-05-26 19:41:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm not a Heat hater
2014-05-26 19:41:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'd definitely feel like a bandwagoner pulling for them
2014-05-26 19:42:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you have a connection now
2014-05-26 19:42:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's like me wearing an Auburn shirt
2014-05-26 19:42:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ehh not quite
2014-05-26 19:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Bosh killing it
2014-05-26 19:45:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah baby
2014-05-26 19:50:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]LBJ is so filthy
2014-05-26 19:51:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to play him one-on-one
2014-05-26 19:51:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would be a close match for sure :)
2014-05-26 19:52:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ain't you sweet
2014-05-26 19:53:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol
2014-05-26 20:16:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Bosh is FEELING it.
2014-05-26 20:16:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's not good for the Pacers.
2014-05-26 20:29:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think his hot streak has run out

2014-05-26 21:28:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I'm retroactively watching the game with you reading through those
2014-05-26 21:43:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I left you some little comments about your trip. It sounds like a lot of fun! Hopefully if I'm not too tired before falling asleep I'll write you up something a little more in depth about the station and the people and the course.
2014-05-26 22:09:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]'ello, love

2014-05-26 22:12:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like to the point I think I should probably talk less tomorrow
2014-05-26 22:13:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how you doin'/

2014-05-26 22:18:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]moving towards that, at least
2014-05-26 22:30:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]if I send you this little one page grant tomorrow, do you think you'll have time after work to edit it?
2014-05-26 22:30:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you obviously don't have to if you just don't want to either
2014-05-26 22:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fo sheezy
2014-05-26 22:31:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your edits were actually really useful last time
2014-05-26 22:31:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but only if I can edit in phrases like "fo sheezy"
2014-05-26 22:31:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't mean "actually" to sound like I was surprised
2014-05-26 22:31:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]obvs
2014-05-26 22:32:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I didn't interpret it that way
2014-05-26 22:32:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad you thought they were helpful
2014-05-26 22:42:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]alright, I think I'm gonna go to sleep now

2014-05-27 08:24:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Buenos días! Te echo des menos y te quiero
2014-05-27 14:05:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lucky for me, you're effing beautiful even without makeup
2014-05-27 14:07:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Psh more like lucky for me, in case you die from falling down in the shower
2014-05-27 14:08:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha sorry I'm not really sure where I was trying to go with that joke
2014-05-27 14:08:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha what THEE fuck
2014-05-27 14:11:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, if you died, I'd be really sad and crying all the time, so if I had to wear makeup it'd be running all down my face. BUT mamacita still gonna want to look fine 
2014-05-27 14:12:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]...It's been a long day
2014-05-27 14:16:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha wow
2014-05-27 17:39:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was work?
2014-05-27 17:40:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not bad. I helped one of the new interns get set up.
2014-05-27 17:40:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Talked to some of the interns about what they're up to.
2014-05-27 17:40:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel pretty good about my skillset after that.
2014-05-27 17:40:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just used that coupon you gave me to get some Hamburger Helper    😃 
2014-05-27 17:42:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!
2014-05-27 17:42:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That sounds like Red Hat really think you know your stuff, which is awesome
2014-05-27 17:43:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'm not really sure how much any of my team is aware of these happenings
2014-05-27 17:43:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I have time to prove myself
2014-05-27 17:43:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I can build something got impress htem
2014-05-27 17:43:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how has your day been?
2014-05-27 17:44:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]build something to impress them
2014-05-27 17:44:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not sure what the got was
2014-05-27 17:49:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't get a hold of Who Wants to be a Millionaire?
2014-05-27 17:49:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I tried emailing both of my contacts and both emails bounced
2014-05-27 17:50:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Day has been good, trying to finish up this grant 
2014-05-27 17:51:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's super sketchy about who wants to be a millionaire
2014-05-27 17:51:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe not be sketchy, but annoying
2014-05-27 17:51:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I left a post on their Facebook page
2014-05-27 17:51:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-27 17:51:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they still haven't responded to it
2014-05-27 17:51:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know how to contact them otherwise
2014-05-27 17:52:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they owe me $1k
2014-05-27 17:53:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah!
2014-05-27 17:53:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, definitely sketchy then
2014-05-27 17:53:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-05-27 17:56:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought this was interesting ->  http://www.spanishdict.com/answers/145743/what-does-te-echo-de-menos-literally-mean
2014-05-27 19:04:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha well it still conveys my meaning!
2014-05-27 19:04:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no you were totally right in your usage
2014-05-27 19:04:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just idiomatic
2014-05-27 19:05:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I asked someone here how to say it
2014-05-27 19:05:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm saying you were right!
2014-05-27 19:06:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just found the literal translation interesting.
2014-05-27 19:28:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I understand what you were saying. I just meant I learned it from a local-ergo knowing an idiom
2014-05-27 19:29:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I went on a nice little 40 min hike before dinner
2014-05-27 19:29:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah? That sounds pretty cool.
2014-05-27 19:29:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oooooh
2014-05-27 19:29:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aaaaaaah
2014-05-27 19:30:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-05-27 19:30:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks awesome!
2014-05-27 19:30:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm so bummed my camera was broken 
2014-05-27 19:30:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't know that.
2014-05-27 19:30:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't know you had a camera.
2014-05-27 19:31:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found out about 5 min before leaving. It's just a digital camera. But I'm gonna steal other peoples pics 
2014-05-27 19:31:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-05-27 19:34:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think you'll have a chance to look at that grant?
2014-05-27 19:36:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I already did. I'm making dinner, do you want it back now?
2014-05-27 19:37:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No that's ok, anytime before tm morning is fine.
2014-05-27 19:37:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hamburger helper?
2014-05-27 19:43:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You know it!
2014-05-27 19:45:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dude, my back has been breaking out. I don't know what the deal is.
2014-05-27 20:59:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]PMS? That's what usually gets me
2014-05-27 21:00:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha probably
2014-05-27 21:00:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's been doing this for a while now though
2014-05-27 21:00:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe a change in climate?
2014-05-27 21:00:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need to get some sun or something
2014-05-27 21:00:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-05-27 21:00:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you found a pool?
2014-05-27 21:00:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no    😞 
2014-05-27 21:00:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't really looked, though
2014-05-27 21:04:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to?
2014-05-27 21:05:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got done with student presentations and writing some emails to oyster people now.
2014-05-27 21:05:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-05-27 21:06:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You?
2014-05-27 21:06:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not much. I think I'm gonna get a shower.
2014-05-27 21:22:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh dear, I've certainly been titilated now. Concentrating on oysters just got much harder....
2014-05-27 22:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This is episode of Hannibal is disgusting
2014-05-27 22:21:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would think that'd be pretty common on that show
2014-05-27 22:22:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It is, but this might be one of the grossest scenes I've ever seen.
2014-05-27 22:36:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna try really hard to video you tomorrow. 
2014-05-27 22:37:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now that that grant is done, I might be able to enjoy my free time a tiny bit more 
2014-05-27 22:39:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]coool
2014-05-27 22:40:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-05-28 01:20:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight my love
2014-05-28 08:53:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you.
2014-05-28 08:54:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!
2014-05-28 09:51:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good news, I'm getting my check. Bad news... I'll never see my episode unless my ex can get it to me.
2014-05-28 10:36:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is that not likely? 
2014-05-28 10:36:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like are you guys on not so great terms?
2014-05-28 10:39:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We don't ever talk, but she recorded the episode without me asking her to and told me she watched it, so that seems promising. Just a matter of how motivated she'll be to get it to me I guess. It's possible she doesn't even have the recording anymore too I guess.
2014-05-28 17:18:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll be free in like 20 min until 6!
2014-05-28 17:19:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ehh 30 min
2014-05-28 17:19:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-05-28 18:02:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Skype?
2014-05-28 18:02:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sure. Gotta switch OSes
2014-05-28 19:54:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do miss you, by the way. A lot. I feel bad the way our convo ended    😞 
2014-05-28 19:55:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry, I shouldn't get into discussions like that when I'm starving and tired 
2014-05-28 19:55:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A recipe to get cranky 
2014-05-28 19:55:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really mind the crankiness, I just rather not end convos that way when I hardly get to talk to you.
2014-05-28 19:56:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd rather end them feeling good and lovey you know?
2014-05-28 19:56:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I know
2014-05-28 19:57:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you
2014-05-28 19:57:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you too
2014-05-28 19:59:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess we just need some practice in how to have discussions like this in a more positive way 
2014-05-28 19:59:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, particularly when we're apart
2014-05-28 20:01:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well, as I've said before, I really that you are able to defend yourself and don't let me dominate debates, so don't ever think I'm not into that.
2014-05-28 20:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you and miss you and want to give you a million kisses all over! Have a nice rest of the evening.
2014-05-28 21:46:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A million kisses would be really nice
2014-05-28 21:47:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got done with an almost 2 hr long lecture. I definitely feel like I'm getting a little socially overstimulated 
2014-05-28 21:47:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If that makes sense.
2014-05-28 21:47:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? I guess class doesn't really equal social for me
2014-05-28 21:47:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or just overstimulated period
2014-05-28 21:47:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Overstimulated I can definitely see
2014-05-28 21:48:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not enough time by myself
2014-05-28 21:48:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Makes sense. Your days do seem really intense, not gonna lie.
2014-05-28 21:50:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The Heat are on by the way ->  http://cfltesthd6.moonfruit.com/
2014-05-28 21:51:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet thanks
2014-05-28 21:52:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh!
2014-05-28 21:52:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was worse before.
2014-05-28 21:52:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]LBJ had five fouls in the 3rd
2014-05-28 21:52:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and sat for a lot of it
2014-05-28 21:57:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know why I get so upset sometimes from conversations like we just had. Earlier I felt almost similar to that time I cried. I've been trying to figure out what causes this reaction, cause it feels illogical and almost an uncontrollable reaction 
2014-05-28 22:00:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. I feel really bad now. I could tell you were kinda peeved.  
2014-05-28 22:00:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no I really think it has something to do with me
2014-05-28 22:01:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, I try not to be attacking with that stuff, so if there's anything I'm doing that is making you upset I'd really want to know
2014-05-28 22:06:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Somehow we just end up focusing on nitpicky things that often boil down to semantics, even though we actually mostly agree. I totally think that we should not focus on promoting benefits for specific races, but instead help out poor people in general. Like your comments on that post about helping bad schools (regardless of their demographics) and making it so all children from poor families have health insurance.
2014-05-28 22:15:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. I'm wondering if I should back off all this kind of stuff in general.
2014-05-28 22:24:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No no no
2014-05-28 22:39:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's not what I want at all
2014-05-28 22:39:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The internet is going in and out
2014-05-28 22:40:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no worries
2014-05-28 22:41:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're probably about to go to bed
2014-05-28 22:42:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably be up for a bit still.
2014-05-28 22:43:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you, and please don't worry!
2014-05-28 22:44:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's just something we can work on, cause I do love that I can talk about tough subjects with you that I can't with many other people
2014-05-28 22:49:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, I guess I mean more in general
2014-05-28 22:49:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like commenting on Facebook posts
2014-05-28 22:49:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my opinion doesn't actually matter
2014-05-28 22:49:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it just seems to piss people off
2014-05-28 22:49:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably not worth it, haha
2014-05-28 22:51:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your opinion of course matters 
2014-05-28 22:55:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if people aren't posting things like that for discussion, then why are they posting them at all.
2014-05-28 22:56:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not worried about upsetting Tim
2014-05-28 22:56:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]other people
2014-05-28 22:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it doesn't matter
2014-05-28 22:57:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I'm either having an epiphany or in a funk
2014-05-28 23:01:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What would be the epiphany?
2014-05-28 23:02:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that what I think really doesn't matter
2014-05-28 23:02:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-05-28 23:09:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]1) you're definitely in a funk, and I feel like it's partly my fault.  2) I know Tim appreciates how you actively participate on Facebook like you do, and other of your friends probably do too 3) what do you mean by "matter"?
2014-05-28 23:09:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will make a difference? Is valuable to those you converse with?
2014-05-28 23:09:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](A)
2014-05-28 23:10:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your opinion matters to me, and who's to say it won't give someone else unanticipated something to think about
2014-05-28 23:11:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I'm down with talking about this stuff with you still.
2014-05-28 23:12:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't compromise just cause you think it might be pissing people off
2014-05-28 23:16:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't really see it as a compromise.
2014-05-28 23:17:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not a big deal! Don't worry about it.
2014-05-28 23:22:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Promise?
2014-05-28 23:23:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though it is kinda funny that we went from me being weirdly rd out to you haha
2014-05-28 23:25:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What?
2014-05-28 23:30:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Goodnight. I love you 😘
2014-05-28 23:30:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*bummed
2014-05-28 23:31:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh the internet is being stupid, and I'm kinda being rude by texting while talking with ppl
2014-05-28 23:31:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'll talk to you tomorrow. Get some sleep!
2014-05-29 02:16:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Merrr
2014-05-29 02:28:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Michael Alcorn, I love you so much and after conversations like this all I want is to be next to you: to see, feel, and observe your responses face-to-face. But I'm also so incredibly grateful that even when I don't have the opportunity I can be connected to you. I know that one day soon these superficial barriers in our communication will be lowered, and that it is more than worth it with you.
2014-05-29 02:29:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aka a bunch of cheesy shit to mean I love you, and I'm already counting down the days. Goodnight my darling 
2014-05-29 07:15:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
2014-05-29 07:16:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you. You are amazing.
2014-05-29 07:18:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Peeing standing up is great and all, but you'll never understand the challenges of peeing while fully erect
2014-05-29 10:58:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha no I probably won't 
2014-05-29 11:03:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a terrribleeee headache this morning 
2014-05-29 11:06:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I drank very much last night, but combining rum and boxed wine may not have been the best idea
2014-05-29 11:34:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man :( I wish I could make you feel better.
2014-05-29 11:34:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like intoxicated Katie gushing haha
2014-05-29 12:10:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah, gushing is the right word
2014-05-29 12:11:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't think that those sentiments only apply when I'm drunk though!
2014-05-29 12:14:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I don't. I actually think it's kind of awesome that that's where your mind goes when your inhibitions are lowered!
2014-05-29 12:15:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What can I say, I kinda like ya :)
2014-05-29 12:16:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry, I meant kinda love you hahaha
2014-05-29 12:16:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It worked either way :)
2014-05-29 12:18:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was referring to my previous drunken gushing
2014-05-29 12:19:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't get it
2014-05-29 12:20:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When I said "I kinda love you"
2014-05-29 12:21:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, I'm lost.
2014-05-29 12:22:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't you remember when I was at Woods Hole and texted you that?
2014-05-29 12:24:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ooh. I thought you meant last night's gushing by "previous"
2014-05-29 12:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The joke was good, my understanding was not.
2014-05-29 12:53:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I actually had to leave class for a bit to be sick 
2014-05-29 12:54:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And now I'm a little worried I caught the mini plague that's been going around between students 
2014-05-29 12:56:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:( that doesn't sound good at all
2014-05-29 16:25:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I felt better after that, but I'm chugging fruit juice even more than usual to try to reduce the risk
2014-05-29 17:15:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure that's been hard for you ;)
2014-05-29 17:28:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got free lunch today and was the only intern with a group of full-time employees
2014-05-29 17:30:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woahhh
2014-05-29 17:30:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did they only invite you?
2014-05-29 17:30:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha no
2014-05-29 17:30:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I totally invited myself
2014-05-29 17:54:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How proactive, I like it
2014-05-29 17:54:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just FaceTimed with my momma
2014-05-29 17:54:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is she?
2014-05-29 17:54:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She started crying. Because she's "so proud"
2014-05-29 17:54:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But otherwise good 
2014-05-29 17:54:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awwww
2014-05-29 20:35:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Millionaire is mailing me a DVD copy of the episode, which they don't normally do so at least they're recognizing their error they had my email  asairalcornZ@gmail.com
2014-05-29 20:35:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as  airalcornZ@gmail.com
2014-05-29 21:24:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]wowww

2014-05-29 21:25:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I gave my presentation today
2014-05-29 21:26:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*tonight
2014-05-29 21:32:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How'd it go?
2014-05-29 21:34:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty ok
2014-05-29 21:35:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's good
2014-05-29 21:35:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The 3rd professor just joined us, and Fred Allendorfs daughter and grandson were there too, so a bigger crowd of strangers. I should've just briefly mentioned the oyster project after
2014-05-29 21:35:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]cause I actually do want to get the plant guys feedback
2014-05-29 21:37:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe you can just meet with him?
2014-05-29 21:38:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah, we eat dinner with them everyday
2014-05-29 21:39:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so I can totally do that
2014-05-29 21:39:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool cool
2014-05-29 21:41:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]watching hannibal?
2014-05-29 21:41:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Spurs vs. OKC
2014-05-29 21:41:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to?
2014-05-29 21:52:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm leading the discussion tomorrow, so doing a lot of reading 
2014-05-29 21:52:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok, well I'll leave you alone
2014-05-29 21:52:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to just chill with you and watch basketball so bad
2014-05-29 21:52:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that would make me sooooo happy
2014-05-29 21:53:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The happiest
2014-05-29 21:54:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yeah, I'm gonna try to focus on "the pollen dispersal kernel and mating system of an insect-pollinated tropical palm"
2014-05-29 21:54:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you, goodnight!
2014-05-29 21:55:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha good luck. I love you so much.
2014-05-29 23:47:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Remember that I leave at 8a tomorrow and won't have internet until Sunday afternoon. But feel free to still send me messages and snaps if you want for me to see when I get back! Have a good weekend, and I'll try to Skype you early next week. Love you lots 
2014-05-30 06:55:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. Have fun. I love you too!
2014-05-30 16:09:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wrote my first pig scripts today!
2014-05-31 18:44:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The due who is taking over my room once I leave has a 181 day streak on Duolingo.
2014-05-31 18:44:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*dude
2014-06-01 00:03:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]These undergrads are so undergrad-y!
2014-06-01 01:18:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I can match your intoxicated gushing, but I'll go ahead and say that I love you a lot. I really do cherish every second we have together. I know that sounds tacky, but I absolutely mean it. I know I've said it before, but I love being in love with you. I love the way you touch me. I love the way you smile at me. I love how you think I'm this super sexy and amazing dude. I love that you like being sexy for me. I love that you challenge me. I love that you want to make sure things are okay, even though they almost always are! I love the way you cuddle with me after we've had sex. I love how you push your butt into my crotch when you're going to sleep (I'm actually smiling just thinking about it). I love your hand gestures when you're really trying to make a point. I love that you're passionate. I love that you value friendship. I love that you are bold. I love how you talk about our future. I love how you're a romantic. I love how you're an empowered female, but also embrace traditionally feminine characteristics. I love that you're probably contesting that previous statement. I love your style. I love that you feel deeply. I love that you're smart. I love that you think I'm smart. I love your smile... I love your smile... I love your smile. I love kissing you. I love making you cum. I love that you love making me cum! I love your goofiness. I love hearing about your day. I love how you support me. I love that you miss me. I love that you want to be with me. I love you.
2014-06-01 11:11:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hello darling! I'm back in Las Cruces, and already back in class 
2014-06-01 11:11:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'll read your gushing during lunch :)
2014-06-01 11:11:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you
2014-06-01 13:27:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That message was so sweet and so perfect it made me tear up a little.
2014-06-01 13:28:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, I'm glad you liked it    😃 
2014-06-01 13:29:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't stop reading it
2014-06-01 13:30:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did the undergrads have a party at your house or something?
2014-06-01 13:30:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-06-01 13:30:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if it was really a party
2014-06-01 13:30:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there was like 10 people total here
2014-06-01 13:31:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but there was beer pong and drunkenness
2014-06-01 13:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and loud music, etc.
2014-06-01 13:31:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha sounds like a good time 
2014-06-01 13:32:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it was fun.
2014-06-01 13:32:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not gonna lie, I miss a little beer pong every now and then
2014-06-01 13:32:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah it was fun to play again
2014-06-01 13:32:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't remember the last time I've played
2014-06-01 13:34:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was your trip?
2014-06-01 13:44:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a lot of fun! Got like three 3-4 hr hikes in through amazing primary forest
2014-06-01 13:45:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Saw bats, frogs, tons of different spiders, the most amazing trees, a viper, some lizards
2014-06-01 13:45:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice!
2014-06-01 13:45:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sounds awesome.
2014-06-01 13:46:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The station felt like a kids summer camp, with big rooms full of bunk beds and a campfire at night
2014-06-01 13:46:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the sky/stars was the best I've ever seen
2014-06-01 13:47:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. Sounds like a great trip!
2014-06-01 13:48:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What did you do this weekend?
2014-06-01 13:49:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dropped my banjo off to get the tuning peg replaced.
2014-06-01 13:49:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know why I originally thought I was gonna buy a brand new banjo.
2014-06-01 13:49:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That was dumb.
2014-06-01 13:49:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And just the party last night.
2014-06-01 13:49:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha well I wasn't gonna say anything...
2014-06-01 13:50:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm glad you can get it fixed up!
2014-06-01 13:51:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'm excited to finally start practicing
2014-06-01 14:00:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]By the way, I really like how you use social media
2014-06-01 14:01:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It makes me want to use it in a more similar way
2014-06-01 14:02:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess what way is that?
2014-06-01 14:02:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like what you said at the end of your WWtbaM? Post
2014-06-01 14:02:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As less of a "highlights reel"
2014-06-01 14:03:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, yeah. Yeah, I don't know. I have a complex relationship with social media.
2014-06-01 14:04:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For a long time I wanted them to function as a sort of surrogate for face-to-face interaction.
2014-06-01 14:04:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And they just don't accomplish that.
2014-06-01 14:05:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I've sort of changed how I look at my "connections" on social media.
2014-06-01 14:05:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I view most of them as basically celebrity characterizations of the actual person
2014-06-01 14:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and all my interaction with them is one way
2014-06-01 14:05:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in that I'm just following them
2014-06-01 14:05:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they don't really know I exist
2014-06-01 14:06:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that has made it a better experience for me
2014-06-01 14:07:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it just simplifies people too much or something.
2014-06-01 14:09:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well, of course it simplifies people and can't completely fill in for face-to-face interactions, but using it more actively than passively and as a more "honest" record of your life is taking advantage of it in a way that most people don't
2014-06-01 14:11:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I mean, if everyone used social media like I do I think I would like it a lot more, but I just don't think that's how most people operate.
2014-06-01 14:12:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well you've potentially inspired at least one person!
2014-06-01 14:12:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we'll see though, usually I drift closer to the "give up on social media completely" side
2014-06-01 14:13:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah I've deactivated my FB account and several occassions and I never miss it.
2014-06-01 14:14:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it was pretty great being without a computer/phone for a couple days
2014-06-01 14:14:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]except for also being disconnected from you
2014-06-01 14:14:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I bet.
2014-06-01 14:15:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]One thing I really like about my current work is that we have to be signed in through a VPN to access our email.
2014-06-01 14:15:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I just don't even check my work email unless I'm at work.
2014-06-01 14:16:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But like you're constantly being notified, so I'm sure being completely cut off was extra nice.
2014-06-01 14:17:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah, and just not looking at a screen, big or small
2014-06-01 14:17:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]at night I read a book with my headlamp and slept just fine, even without pvz
2014-06-01 14:18:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha,whoa!
2014-06-01 14:19:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]proof that it's just in my head
2014-06-01 14:19:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, well I'm sure a few long hikes helped out too
2014-06-01 14:19:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]only 2 weeks from Wednesday!
2014-06-01 14:19:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can't wait.
2014-06-01 14:26:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]back to class
2014-06-01 14:26:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]bleghhh
2014-06-01 14:27:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what're you doing this evening?
2014-06-01 14:27:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not much. Maybe watch some Hannibal.
2014-06-01 14:28:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll have to reply to some oyster emails, but maybe we can get a tiny Skype in
2014-06-01 14:28:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be nice    😃 
2014-06-01 19:33:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Skype now?
2014-06-01 19:33:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeppp
2014-06-01 19:33:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let me get on Windows
2014-06-01 19:36:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-06-01 20:34:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This scene in Hannibal was your worst nightmare.
2014-06-01 21:33:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do NOT want to hear about it
2014-06-01 21:33:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no you do not
2014-06-01 21:42:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We just got out of class
2014-06-01 21:42:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And somehow have to read 45 pages of papers for discussion at 3 tm
2014-06-01 21:43:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Holy moley
2014-06-01 21:43:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And yes, we still have class 8a-12p and 1:30-2:45
2014-06-01 21:44:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not gonna do it
2014-06-01 21:44:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, tsk, tsk
2014-06-01 21:45:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yo, I participate more than everyone else, some people literally do not speak in discussions, it's not for a grade, and I really want to watch GoT
2014-06-01 21:45:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm justified 
2014-06-01 21:46:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha, fair enough.
2014-06-01 21:57:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dreamed about you last night, btw
2014-06-01 21:58:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Something kinda weird and abstract (or at least how I'm remembering it)
2014-06-01 21:59:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we were in the forest and our feet got stuck under these roots and then we started slowly morphing into trees and our branches were all wrapped around each other and your leaves looked like a beard
2014-06-01 22:00:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my leaves were tiny and on twisty tendrils 
2014-06-01 22:01:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Whoa! That's trippy as hell and pretty awesome.
2014-06-01 22:01:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've probably seen more green in the past few days than I ever have
2014-06-01 22:03:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I was about to say, it's crazy how our brain attempts to sort things out in dreams.
2014-06-01 22:03:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So weird how all these things are happening when you're unconscious too.
2014-06-01 22:04:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was definitely thinking about you a lot before bed too. 
2014-06-01 22:04:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could've used the extra body heat!
2014-06-01 22:04:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha aw. I would've been glad to provide it.
2014-06-01 22:05:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm trying to decide if that would make a good painting or not.
2014-06-01 22:06:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I dunno. The atmosphere changed a lot during it 
2014-06-01 22:06:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-06-01 22:07:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Carefree-> annoyed -> freaked out -> silly/funny (cause of the beard) -> content
2014-06-01 22:07:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And i don't know if a picture could catch all that
2014-06-01 22:07:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe a flip book
2014-06-01 22:08:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh ok, I was referring to the final image.
2014-06-01 22:09:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like you could represent the coarseness of the beard without being really overt about it.
2014-06-01 22:10:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know, I really like that image for some reason.
2014-06-01 22:11:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't take this as a full-fledged support of a wild beard
2014-06-01 22:12:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-06-01 22:12:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Harsh!
2014-06-01 22:12:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But no I didn't take it that way.
2014-06-01 22:12:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna be nice and trimmed when you get here.
2014-06-01 22:12:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:D
2014-06-01 22:13:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You still looked quite handsome today 
2014-06-01 22:14:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks :) and you were beautiful as always.
2014-06-01 22:14:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was kinda bummed about how short our session was honestly
2014-06-01 22:14:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss ya lots :(
2014-06-01 22:14:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, I should've warned you
2014-06-01 22:15:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can put the video on now while I read? (I could t go through with wanton irresponsibility after all)
2014-06-01 22:15:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok :) are you gonna make me boot into Windows again?
2014-06-01 22:16:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can try hangoutssss
2014-06-01 22:16:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-06-01 22:18:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can you hear me?
2014-06-01 22:19:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can you hear me?
2014-06-01 22:19:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-06-01 22:20:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yes I can hear you
2014-06-01 22:20:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you hear me?
2014-06-01 22:20:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My mic is working
2014-06-01 22:20:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]According to my computer
2014-06-01 22:20:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Say something 
2014-06-01 22:20:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've been saying things!
2014-06-01 23:28:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ashley Christensen
2014-06-01 23:33:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Battisella's
2014-06-01 23:54:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need to touch youuuu
2014-06-01 23:55:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So badly
2014-06-01 23:57:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was almost torture seeing you half naked 
2014-06-01 23:58:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My eyes were definitely wandering when you were in certain positions.
2014-06-02 00:00:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!
2014-06-02 00:01:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wishing you could do more than look....goodnight my love 
2014-06-02 00:04:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too. Sweet dreams, beautiful.
2014-06-02 14:51:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Man... you are straight up gorgeous. I loved that pic.
2014-06-02 17:32:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Three course lunch on Red Hat's dime.
2014-06-02 17:32:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had a pretty amazing sandwich
2014-06-02 17:33:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Turkey Croissant: House roasted turkey breast, cranberry BBQ sauce, applewood smoked bacon, cheddar, jumbo flaky  croissant."
2014-06-02 18:55:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh man
2014-06-02 18:55:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know that's right up my ally
2014-06-02 18:56:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was pretty delicious, and I don't usually get all that excited about food.
2014-06-02 18:56:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I'm rubbing off on you ;)
2014-06-02 18:56:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In more ways than one.
2014-06-02 18:57:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oooooooh!!!!!!
2014-06-02 18:57:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh. My. God.
2014-06-02 18:58:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-02 18:58:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not sure of I can fully support that 
2014-06-02 18:58:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha whaaaat
2014-06-02 18:58:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't be a hater
2014-06-02 18:58:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean the punniness
2014-06-02 18:59:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not the applicability haha
2014-06-02 18:59:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know... don't be a hater!
2014-06-02 18:59:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how's your day going, love?
2014-06-02 19:01:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not too bad. Managed to participate in discussion despite my unpreparedness
2014-06-02 19:01:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]thattagirl
2014-06-02 19:02:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Went on a little hour long hike just now and saw a bright bluegreen cicada 
2014-06-02 19:02:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's cool.
2014-06-02 19:03:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was your day?
2014-06-02 19:03:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pretty good.
2014-06-02 19:03:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Free like two hour lunch.
2014-06-02 19:03:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wrote this text classifier that I think is kinda useful.
2014-06-02 19:04:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Mike (the guy who I'm working with who works remote from Arkansas) is in Raleigh this week, along with the other Arkansas guys
2014-06-02 19:04:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm meeting with him tomorrow to get into some of the details of my project
2014-06-02 19:13:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And with that, my credit card is paid off and I hope to never be that poor again.
2014-06-02 19:14:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet, I got 18.22 from Time Warner too.
2014-06-02 19:29:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why did Time Warner pay you?
2014-06-02 19:30:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm guessing it has to do with the fact they cut off my Internet early.
2014-06-02 19:30:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah, makes sense
2014-06-02 19:30:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm more excited about that check than I am the Millionaire one, haha
2014-06-02 19:30:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Surprise money is where it's at.
2014-06-02 19:31:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that's great Who Wants to be a Millionaire? got a check to you so quick 
2014-06-02 19:31:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, they've actually been pretty responsive once I got a hold of them.
2014-06-02 19:31:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They seemed genuinely apologetic too.
2014-06-02 19:31:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So we're good
2014-06-02 19:31:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-06-02 19:32:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]More Hannibal tonight?
2014-06-02 19:32:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-06-02 19:32:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]watching some ML stuff right now, though
2014-06-02 19:35:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You have a pretty impressive work ethic. Or at least personal investment in learning
2014-06-02 19:36:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm pretty interested in learning in general, but this is more to make up for the fact that I think my Machine Learning course at UTD was really poorly taught and I didn't learn much.
2014-06-02 19:36:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This course I'm taking now is really well taught.
2014-06-02 19:37:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The profs explain the conceptual side of the algorithms really well, which is all I really need at this point.
2014-06-02 19:37:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That just further supports my comment haha
2014-06-02 19:39:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There are certain things in stats and comp sci that are pretty Zen for me too
2014-06-02 19:39:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like Bayes rule
2014-06-02 19:39:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and Merge Sort
2014-06-02 19:39:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*Bayes' rule
2014-06-02 22:01:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like the idea of imagining you in coding zen
2014-06-02 22:07:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]are you already asleep?
2014-06-02 22:08:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nope. What're you up to?
2014-06-02 22:15:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Readingggg
2014-06-02 22:15:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're having power surges and the internet is being really sketch right now
2014-06-02 22:16:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I just wanted to say goodnight and that I love you while I can
2014-06-02 22:17:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Alright. Goodnight. I love you too.
2014-06-02 22:19:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah!
2014-06-03 02:07:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It makes me really bummed when women support the idea that other women should wear "appropriate clothes" to class or to work. In other words cover up cleavage or skin to prevent male professors from being "titilated". This came up in conversation tonight, and this girl I felt like I had a lot in common with at UW said some straight up "slut shaming" comments that really surprised me
2014-06-03 02:09:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think anyone (male or female)'s choice of outfit in most situations should be dictated by how it might stimulate another person. 
2014-06-03 02:12:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At the end of the day, it's just a body, and only a fraction of what makes a person who they are. And we as humans have evolved enough to manage our baser instincts
2014-06-03 02:13:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry to randomly rant, and I'm sure you have some argument/comments about what I said. 
2014-06-03 02:13:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess I more just wanted to get it off my chest
2014-06-03 02:14:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I felt like everyone thought my comments were ridiculous and radical and awkwardly ignored them
2014-06-03 02:14:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that's always kind of a shorty feeling
2014-06-03 02:15:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*shitty
2014-06-03 02:15:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anyways, goodnight again. Love you and always glad I can send you my frustrated thoughts-even when you're asleep :)
2014-06-03 12:43:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We can talk about this stuff more tonight if you want. Slut-shaming is a shitty thing to do, and so is ignoring people with valid arguments. I love you.
2014-06-03 12:45:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should add that I'm somewhat sympathetic to your fellow students, though. I used to be pretty judgmental I guess about casual sex and promiscuity, but that's the environment a lot of Americans are brought up in.
2014-06-03 14:20:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Slut shaming was more referring to women who dress "slutty" in this case, and that if you want to be taken seriously by anyone you have to cover up. As for casual sex, I was raised in that environment too, possibly to a greater extent than you.  But I guess I'd hope that educated young people who are openly agnostic/atheist (and therefore should abide less by sexual morality as established by religion) would be a little more progressive about the subject.
2014-06-03 14:26:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I had to work to get over some of the subtle and not so subtle biases that my upbringing left me, and it's always slightly disappointing when you're reminded that those biases are still being propituated.
2014-06-03 14:40:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess people are allowed to have morals regarding sex if they're going to have morals. They shouldn't impose on anyone, though.
2014-06-03 14:41:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All atheists should acknowledge morality isn't real. That's my solution to this problem, haha.
2014-06-03 15:36:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I just understand the arguments for most "morals" still held by agnostics (like why one would judge someone for killing people or stealing things) but can't figure out why someone would care about another person's sex life 
2014-06-03 15:37:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With the exception of nonconsensual sex, obvs
2014-06-03 15:39:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess if you don't want unintended pregnancies or STDs spreading.
2014-06-03 15:41:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then judge people if they practice unsafe sex if that's your problem 
2014-06-03 15:42:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fair enough.
2014-06-03 15:55:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm assuming the "you"s and "your"s weren't accurate, in that you do not still look unfavorably on people because of their personal lives?
2014-06-03 15:58:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't judge anyone.
2014-06-03 16:01:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Kinda interesting that you'd imply that. And I'm curious what you're response would be if I said I did.
2014-06-03 16:31:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know you don't
2014-06-03 16:32:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just curious about how your attitude shifted in a relatively short period of time
2014-06-03 16:33:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I guess just double checking that it did shift
2014-06-03 16:35:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd be a little surprised if you did say you were judgmental, but you've said in a previous discussion how your instinctual response to certain actions can color or outweigh your logical response
2014-06-03 16:39:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Overall though I'd probably be more bummed if you supported or held double standards than if you were just unbiased in being contemptuous
2014-06-03 16:50:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok. Can that be the end of this convo?
2014-06-03 16:51:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sorry
2014-06-03 16:51:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I shouldn't have just ended it when you said "Fair enough"
2014-06-03 16:52:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*should've
2014-06-03 16:52:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No worries. Just not digging the vibe.
2014-06-03 16:53:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-06-03 16:53:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you?
2014-06-03 17:10:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too? lol
2014-06-03 17:11:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just making sure we're ok
2014-06-03 17:11:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]mwah
2014-06-03 17:11:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-06-03 17:23:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was work today?
2014-06-03 17:24:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty good. Talked with Mike for a little over an hour.
2014-06-03 17:25:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how has your day been?
2014-06-03 17:26:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty cool. More free lunch?
2014-06-03 17:26:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah, I ate my sandwich today. But I guess the snacks are always free.
2014-06-03 17:26:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My days been ok
2014-06-03 17:27:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty sure I'm giving up on oysters as a thesis project 
2014-06-03 17:27:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man    😞 
2014-06-03 17:27:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So now I'm just trying to figure out how to make this field season not an entire waste
2014-06-03 17:27:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why are you giving up?
2014-06-03 17:28:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's a lab that's very much doing exactly what I wanted to do with both oyster species, and have already started reciprocal transplants. And are even sequencing a genome for the Olympia oyster.
2014-06-03 17:29:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, bummer.
2014-06-03 17:29:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna have a Skype call with the PI and see if we could figure something collaborative for me to do
2014-06-03 17:29:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that might be like a chapter 
2014-06-03 17:30:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm thinking maybe calcifying algae can be my niche
2014-06-03 17:31:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Similar concepts?
2014-06-03 17:33:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-06-03 17:33:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They can have some cool dispersal dynamics
2014-06-03 17:33:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As well as some clonal growth
2014-06-03 17:34:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Id have to sequence a genome though, but I don't think that's be too hard
2014-06-03 17:34:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word.
2014-06-03 17:34:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So what do you think you're gonna do this summer?
2014-06-03 17:36:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Still going to set out settlement substrates and look at allele frequency shifts across life stages in WA. And maybe expand that to more locations. 
2014-06-03 17:37:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll still meet with people and talk about ideas. 
2014-06-03 17:38:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe look around areas with known pH variability and see what kinds of critters live there 
2014-06-03 17:38:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That should be fun still.
2014-06-03 17:40:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah it'll still be fun, just not what I wrote all that hinds stuff about 
2014-06-03 17:42:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh well. You'll have a lot of time to focus on ideas now and really sort out the details.
2014-06-03 17:43:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think three weeks is the maximum amount of time I'm comfortable with being apart.
2014-06-03 18:00:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We went from 6 as the max to 3?
2014-06-03 18:01:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no way I ever said I was okay with 6
2014-06-03 18:01:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well it's going to be 4 this time
2014-06-03 18:02:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm not changing the max.
2014-06-03 18:02:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think we're at a place where we really have that much control over that.
2014-06-03 18:02:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just saying I really become aware of the distance at around two weeks I think.
2014-06-03 18:03:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And so I think seeing the light at the end of the tunnel after two weeks makes three weeks my max.
2014-06-03 18:04:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I know, I start really feeling it after 2 weeks too.
2014-06-03 18:06:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This summer is probably going to be one of the most inflexible times though for both of us
2014-06-03 18:07:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm still going to try to fly to Raleigh in July, but my plans are just so up in the air right now.
2014-06-03 18:07:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all good, I wasn't trying to make you feel guilty or anything.
2014-06-03 18:08:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't want you to feel like you have to come see me if you have other things going on.
2014-06-03 18:08:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't expecting to see you in July in the first place.
2014-06-03 18:09:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It kinda did, or self inflected guilt. I just don't want this to come down to "if we don't see each other every 3 weeks then this won't work out"
2014-06-03 18:10:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can see how my initial comment came across that way now.
2014-06-03 18:10:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just trying to say how I feel about it, though.
2014-06-03 18:10:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It sounded like I was putting an ultimatum on the relationship.
2014-06-03 18:10:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But that wasn't my intent.
2014-06-03 18:13:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, if it does start getting to a point where the strain from distance is worse than not being together at all then obviously I want you to talk to me about it
2014-06-03 18:13:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or if I could do something to make it easier. 
2014-06-03 18:15:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I've been making a pretty big effort to talk to you as much as possible since I got here.
2014-06-03 18:15:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I mean you don't have to worry about it.
2014-06-03 18:15:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't really trying to make you feel bad, like I said.
2014-06-03 18:16:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If it becomes a big issues for me I'll talk to you about it.
2014-06-03 18:16:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I shouldn't have said anything.
2014-06-03 18:16:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It is what it is.
2014-06-03 18:20:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can bring up how you feel about the distance, it's what's on your mind. I just need to not take it so negatively every time, or be paranoid that it means your having doubts
2014-06-03 18:21:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yo, I love you.
2014-06-03 18:21:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like a lot.
2014-06-03 18:21:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The reason the distance sucks so much is because I love you so much.
2014-06-03 18:22:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not doubting anything.
2014-06-03 18:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just really miss you... that's all I'm saying.
2014-06-03 18:24:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok ok ok
2014-06-03 18:24:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm silly I know
2014-06-03 18:25:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not silly. I just wish I could do or say something to not have these ocassional doubts.
2014-06-03 18:25:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How the fuck do you spell occassional
2014-06-03 18:25:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]occasional 
2014-06-03 18:25:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there
2014-06-03 18:27:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha. Dude, they stem from previous experiences in my life and have nothing to do with what you do. Probably only some time will get rid of them completely 
2014-06-03 18:28:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You give me more than enough confidence and security in us
2014-06-03 18:29:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, well I'll try to be more sensitive about the things I say, or the way I phrase them rather.
2014-06-03 18:29:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-06-03 18:31:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've heard a couple engineers in my area use "retarded" a couple of times.
2014-06-03 18:31:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's kinda a bummer.
2014-06-03 18:31:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]People are pretty lax about language, which is cool.
2014-06-03 18:32:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I guess the sensitivity of that word still isn't as widely acknowledged as other offensive words.
2014-06-03 18:35:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-06-03 18:43:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And since the word itself does mean "slowed", as opposed to other offensive words that don't actually correlate with what they refer to
2014-06-03 18:43:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like you can still use retarded in it's proper context and not be indirectly insulting anyone  
2014-06-03 18:44:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I suppose so.
2014-06-03 18:44:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The n-word is derived from a word for black, though.
2014-06-03 18:45:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But that's sort of an extreme example
2014-06-03 18:45:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It has a much longer history of negativity.
2014-06-03 18:47:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It just might take a lot longer (if ever) for a majority of people to recognize what they're really indicating when they say "retarded" 
2014-06-03 18:48:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. It would take some sort of legislation probably
2014-06-03 18:48:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which probably won't happen
2014-06-03 18:48:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like identifying it as a hate word or something
2014-06-03 18:54:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm listening to ESPN Radio and this dude is just ripping on guy's who have their girlfriends in their avatar picture with them.
2014-06-03 18:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, haters, man!
2014-06-03 18:54:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*guys
2014-06-03 18:54:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Avatar picture?
2014-06-03 18:54:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Profile pic
2014-06-03 18:55:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Avatar picture might be redundant.
2014-06-03 18:56:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I always assumed avatar was an altered representation of yourself
2014-06-03 18:56:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yeah that dude is definitely a hater 
2014-06-03 18:56:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And probably a little lonely
2014-06-03 18:57:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He has this sort of macho streak that's pretty annoying.
2014-06-03 18:59:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have you ever played dots?
2014-06-03 19:34:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The phone game where you put your fingers on different colored dots?
2014-06-03 19:34:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep
2014-06-03 19:36:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A long time ago, like in the days of my iPod touch
2014-06-03 19:36:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why? Are you getting your fingers all in a twist right now?
2014-06-03 19:38:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I play it every now and then. It's the only mobile game I've kept on my phone.  http://www.wired.com/2013/07/can-quit-playing-dots-heres-why/?cid=co9730904
2014-06-03 19:38:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's the game you're thinking of right?
2014-06-03 19:40:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No this is different
2014-06-03 19:41:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh okay. Yeah, I didn't think it was that old.
2014-06-03 19:41:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's pretty fun.
2014-06-03 19:41:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And the sounds and colors are pretty pleasant.
2014-06-03 19:45:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could use a little variety in my nighttime gameplay 
2014-06-03 19:55:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you ever play Quiz Up?
2014-06-03 19:56:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Never heard of it.
2014-06-03 19:56:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You challenge people to 10 question quizzes on every topic you could imagine 
2014-06-03 19:57:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Interesting. How are the questions?
2014-06-03 21:21:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry was in lecture
2014-06-03 21:23:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you'd like it. The difficult of questions varies a lot depending on the topic, but there are usually enough that you don't get repeats 
2014-06-03 21:28:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I gave it a shot.
2014-06-03 21:28:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was decent. I'm not really crazy about playing trivia by myself, though.
2014-06-03 21:29:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Unless it's going through J! archives
2014-06-03 21:29:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well we can challenge each other!
2014-06-03 21:29:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, well that could be fun.
2014-06-03 21:29:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or not if you get mad.
2014-06-03 21:30:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?!
2014-06-03 21:30:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not a sore loser
2014-06-03 21:30:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And maybe I won't even lose
2014-06-03 21:30:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What about that
2014-06-03 21:30:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-03 21:31:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was class?
2014-06-03 21:35:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The director of the station talked to us about reforestation
2014-06-03 21:36:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was pretty cool actually 
2014-06-03 21:39:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Tim is on quizup
2014-06-03 21:39:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's your user name?
2014-06-03 21:51:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have to reinstall it.
2014-06-03 21:51:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm linked on all my social media, though.
2014-06-03 22:05:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you deleted it that quickly?
2014-06-03 22:07:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. Like I said, I don't really play trivia games by myself.
2014-06-03 22:25:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I challenged you in dots too
2014-06-03 22:34:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dots keeps crashing when I try to connect with Facebook.
2014-06-03 22:34:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Seems like there might be a bug.
2014-06-03 22:37:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]report it!
2014-06-03 22:37:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did.
2014-06-03 22:41:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fartie?
2014-06-03 22:42:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yup
2014-06-03 22:43:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]really clever I know
2014-06-03 22:56:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not mad
2014-06-03 22:56:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I may obsessively challenge you until I win
2014-06-03 22:59:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-06-03 22:59:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm loling.
2014-06-03 23:06:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Goodnight. I love you.
2014-06-03 23:06:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]goodnight my dear
2014-06-03 23:06:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you too, and sorry for the meh vibes earlier!
2014-06-03 23:07:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]let's get a little video in tomorrow
2014-06-03 23:08:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds good.
2014-06-03 23:08:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send me a sleepy snap!
2014-06-04 07:16:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good morning, sunshine. I hope you have a great day. I love you!
2014-06-04 08:02:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good morning 
2014-06-04 08:03:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know how you said you daydream about coming home and having dinner with me?
2014-06-04 08:05:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-06-04 08:06:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty much every morning I fantasize about waking up to you kissing and touching me, then making love to me, then having breakfast with you before you leave 
2014-06-04 08:06:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then obviously going back to sleep until 10a haha
2014-06-04 08:09:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sounds amazing :) and you have no idea how happy it makes me hearing you say that.
2014-06-04 08:10:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't wait to do that when you get here.
2014-06-04 08:10:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Better stock up on the bacon
2014-06-04 08:11:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I'll have plenty.
2014-06-04 08:12:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really like the idea of saying someone is perfect, but you are perfect for me.
2014-06-04 08:12:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like that statement a million times more 
2014-06-04 08:13:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have a great day at work!
2014-06-04 08:14:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks. I love you 😘
2014-06-04 08:14:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah!
2014-06-04 11:38:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That Facebook status gets the Michael A. Alcorn stamp of approval.
2014-06-04 12:16:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This one intern is probably around 20 years old and just tears through like several cans of Diet Mountain Dew a day.
2014-06-04 12:43:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha I knew you'd like it!
2014-06-04 12:44:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I don;t know how you can comment on anyone for their processed beverage consumption
2014-06-04 12:46:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You referring to my Gatorade binge?
2014-06-04 12:47:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and your diet while driving long distances
2014-06-04 12:47:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and the fact you complained about wanting a gatorade/mountain dew like 500 times when you were visiting :)
2014-06-04 12:49:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha fair enough. The dude has like three to four a day, though. I feel like he's asking for a kidney stone.
2014-06-04 12:50:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or some shrunken bawls
2014-06-04 12:51:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol you're goofy.
2014-06-04 12:55:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]are you chatting at work?
2014-06-04 12:55:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*gchatting
2014-06-04 12:56:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, on my phone. It's no biggie.
2014-06-04 12:56:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]stickin' it to the man
2014-06-04 12:56:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like it
2014-06-04 12:57:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]More like everyone does it.
2014-06-04 12:58:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I figured, I'm just trying to tease you about the corporate life
2014-06-04 12:58:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]computer workshop this morning was brutal
2014-06-04 13:00:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How so?
2014-06-04 13:35:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Both programs didn't work well with Macs, so we're using Wine and there's just been lots of silly issues for people getting things to work
2014-06-04 13:36:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And at least one of them is pretty outdated and everyone does it in R now, so it felt like we were learning stuff with little benefit 
2014-06-04 13:37:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man :(
2014-06-04 13:37:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we had the TASTIEST carrots at lunch
2014-06-04 13:38:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They were thin and grilled and I want to learn how to make them so I can eat them all the time 
2014-06-04 13:38:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I honestly don't know why all scientists aren't required to have Linux virtual machines on their computers. It would completely solve the compatibility issues people run into.
2014-06-04 13:39:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha those carrots sound pretty tasty, though!
2014-06-04 13:39:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's probably not that hard to make a version for each
2014-06-04 13:40:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not quite.
2014-06-04 13:41:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Especially not for people who aren't software engineers by trade.
2014-06-04 13:41:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There are all kinds of incompatibility issues with native libraries between the three OSes and the various versions.
2014-06-04 13:41:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Linux is the easiest system to replicate.
2014-06-04 13:42:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Does it cost money to get a virtual Linux 
2014-06-04 13:43:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No that's why I'm saying it should be required.
2014-06-04 13:44:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How would you require all scientists to do anything with their computers? 
2014-06-04 13:45:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant more like grad students.
2014-06-04 13:46:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like all first year UChicago students have to install a Linux virtual machine.
2014-06-04 13:46:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe I can sell the Darwin cluster some Red Hat ;)
2014-06-04 13:47:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pfftttt
2014-06-04 13:47:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How do I put a Linux thing on my computer?
2014-06-04 13:47:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or rather which one
2014-06-04 13:49:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Google "install Linux virtual machine Mac" and click the tuaw link from 2013.
2014-06-04 13:55:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I can't do it on this Air
2014-06-04 13:56:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'll save that link for my computer
2014-06-04 13:57:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You don't have admin privileges on the Air?
2014-06-04 13:58:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do
2014-06-04 13:59:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I don't wanna fuck with it when I'm just gonna turn it back in in a couple weeks
2014-06-04 13:59:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh ok. I thought you were asking so you could have stuff working while you were there.
2014-06-04 13:59:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and Ben Rubin only gave me the password if I promised to  never tell anyone else it and only install things that were "necessary for the course"
2014-06-04 13:59:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]nah, I actually just did half the stuff today in R
2014-06-04 14:00:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I gave up on the bullshit
2014-06-04 14:01:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I see your point though, I should probably have Linux for future work
2014-06-04 14:02:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. Yeah you're probably better off doing stuff in R because it'll allow you to be more adaptable. And having Linux will definitely come in handy I think.
2014-06-04 15:37:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's pouring here! Kinda cool to watch it rain out of big ass windows.
2014-06-04 17:12:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you live on a high floor?
2014-06-04 17:12:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]11th
2014-06-04 17:12:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm assuming you meant "work"
2014-06-04 17:14:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-04 17:14:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes
2014-06-04 17:15:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it better not rain when I get there
2014-06-04 17:15:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've had my rain fix for a few centuries
2014-06-04 17:15:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, well it only rained for like 15 minutes today, so hopefully even if it does it's not for too long.
2014-06-04 17:16:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Although, I think it's supposed to storm overnight.
2014-06-04 17:17:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm ok with that
2014-06-04 17:17:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we gotta find a pool though
2014-06-04 17:17:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe we'll be able to hit up the hotel pool?
2014-06-04 17:17:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what hotel are people staying at?
2014-06-04 17:18:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no idea
2014-06-04 17:18:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it was not broadly organized like sicb
2014-06-04 17:18:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but that's a good idea
2014-06-04 17:18:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tim said him and Tim are staying at a nice one
2014-06-04 17:18:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*Tom
2014-06-04 17:19:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]heck yeah. We'll crash their place then.
2014-06-04 17:19:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I don't really have time for pooling much.
2014-06-04 17:19:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I guess you'll crash their place.
2014-06-04 17:19:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]on the weekend?
2014-06-04 17:19:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh yeah. You never gave me a straight answer about camping.
2014-06-04 17:19:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so were you gonna go without me??
2014-06-04 17:20:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah??
2014-06-04 17:20:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i meant while I'm visiting
2014-06-04 17:20:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know.
2014-06-04 17:20:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you have 2 sleeping bags?
2014-06-04 17:20:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was being a mean.
2014-06-04 17:20:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no a
2014-06-04 17:20:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-04 17:20:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and no I do not
2014-06-04 17:21:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll let you know soon
2014-06-04 17:21:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just before next weekend so I know whether I need to get a trip in or not
2014-06-04 17:22:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well, it's really more up to you.  Pros: camping together Cons: less going out with darwinians (which I see them enough anyways)
2014-06-04 17:24:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I thought you were all really wanting to go, that's the only reason I'm even mentioning it.
2014-06-04 17:24:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You were the one who brought it up in the first place.
2014-06-04 17:25:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]where'd you go last time?
2014-06-04 17:25:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Morrow Mountain
2014-06-04 17:32:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Also means less doing it.
2014-06-04 17:34:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what?
2014-06-04 17:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if we go camping haha
2014-06-04 17:34:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh haha I got it
2014-06-04 17:34:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's a pretty sad resin to not go
2014-06-04 17:34:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*reason
2014-06-04 17:35:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know the connotation of sad in this context
2014-06-04 17:44:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I meant more just slightly pitiful
2014-06-04 17:44:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it certainly would not be sad
2014-06-04 17:45:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you're saying that that wouldn't be a good reason to not go
2014-06-04 17:46:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes
2014-06-04 17:46:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-06-04 17:46:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]at least maybe not the only reason
2014-06-04 17:47:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but, I'm thinking maybe we should leave camping for another time
2014-06-04 17:48:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's fine
2014-06-04 17:48:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]there'll be another opportunity I'm sure
2014-06-04 17:48:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt
2014-06-04 17:59:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm pretty ready to be done with this class
2014-06-04 18:04:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I led discussion today, and asked a very specific question based on a review paper about scattered trees- like "outline a project you would do to provide genetic evidence for this ecological claim, including the programs you would use". And it was straight crickets. Then someone answered with a vague comment about bats, so I asked the question again and one of the teachers started to respond and I said, "well let's get a student response 1st, I'll even buy whoever answers a drink." And  this woman said really snappy "why don't you tell us what you would do"
2014-06-04 18:05:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]People complain a lot about how the class is designed, but I'm really starting to think that we could all be getting a lot more out of it if people actively participated
2014-06-04 18:07:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like what's the point of reading so much if you're just going to not speak? You might as well just go hiking
2014-06-04 18:07:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]truth.
2014-06-04 18:08:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I kinda wonder why it's even in Costa Rica
2014-06-04 18:09:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah that's been a complaint too, but like it would cost the same in the US ($1700), so might as well be in a beautiful place
2014-06-04 18:09:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is that possible
2014-06-04 18:09:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And someone said last class at least half of the people stayed and did projects 
2014-06-04 18:10:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The American Genetics Association and OTS itself subsidizes it  
2014-06-04 18:10:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so they wouldn't subsidize it in the States?
2014-06-04 18:10:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know
2014-06-04 18:11:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#lolscience
2014-06-04 18:11:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It does bring together US and Latin American students too
2014-06-04 18:11:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why make them come to Michigan when we could be here 
2014-06-04 18:12:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And most of our examples are studies done in Latin America 
2014-06-04 18:12:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fair enough
2014-06-04 18:13:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]doesn't really sound like y'all are taking advantage of the surrounding is all I'm saying
2014-06-04 18:13:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a field course would've made more sense
2014-06-04 18:14:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm a hater, tho
2014-06-04 18:14:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes
2014-06-04 18:14:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I still love you
2014-06-04 18:14:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-06-04 18:18:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You would totally not be happy with this course haha
2014-06-04 18:19:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I would've never taken it in the first place.
2014-06-04 18:19:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Genetics ain't my thang.
2014-06-04 18:24:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think America needs a four day work week.
2014-06-04 18:25:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh really?
2014-06-04 18:25:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha really
2014-06-04 18:25:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What about people in the service industry? 
2014-06-04 18:26:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why can't they have a four day work week?
2014-06-04 18:26:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Should restaurants, grocery stores, post offices, and the like also only be open 4 days 
2014-06-04 18:26:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm more saying 32 hours should be full-time
2014-06-04 18:26:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Banks
2014-06-04 18:26:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]none of those places are only open five days a week
2014-06-04 18:27:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you make the divide in "luxury" even greater
2014-06-04 18:27:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol wut
2014-06-04 18:28:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]People who have to work 7 days to be lower middle class compared to other people who now get to relax 3 more days of the week
2014-06-04 18:29:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, maybe I'm just full of shit
2014-06-04 18:30:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For lower class people you'd just shift their income up
2014-06-04 18:30:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to what they were getting for 40 hours
2014-06-04 18:30:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to 32 hours
2014-06-04 18:30:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it would add jobs
2014-06-04 18:30:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it'd do the opposite
2014-06-04 18:30:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if it was mandated
2014-06-04 18:31:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where is the money coming to pay more per hour, when the same hours of work still need to occur in many industries 
2014-06-04 18:32:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]From the shareholders
2014-06-04 18:33:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like small businesses are fucked
2014-06-04 20:59:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going out to the bar, if you're not awake when I get back, goodnight!
2014-06-04 21:00:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight... have fun!
2014-06-05 01:42:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I had so much fun, my roommate is a classically trained salsa dancer and taught a bunch of us how to dance and one of our professors bought us shots and we got to sit out by the stars
2014-06-05 01:43:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we really need to go dancing at some point :)
2014-06-05 02:01:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you my dear, I was telling someone in the program all about our crazy story, and it just reminded me how incredibly lucky we are to have found each other!
2014-06-05 02:01:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet dreams 
2014-06-05 07:29:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D I'm glad you had a good time. That sounds like a lot of fun. I think it's kinda funny how we still haven't gone dancing together since we started dating, even though that was one of the things that sealed our physical chemistry in the first place.
2014-06-05 07:38:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Raleigh
2014-06-05 07:38:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should make it h&m appen 
2014-06-05 07:38:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*happen
2014-06-05 07:46:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds good. I didn't sleep well for the first time in a while last night. I had bad vibes :(
2014-06-05 07:47:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bad vibes from what?
2014-06-05 07:49:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Our last convo.
2014-06-05 07:50:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The 4 day work week one?
2014-06-05 07:50:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah and prior to that.
2014-06-05 07:51:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you stopped replying because my internet was being wonky or you were eating dinner or just bored with the conversation 
2014-06-05 07:54:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It just seemed tense to me I guess.
2014-06-05 07:54:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry, you should've mentioned something we could've talked about it a little bit before I went out
2014-06-05 07:55:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I was frustrated and tense at the beginning of the conversation
2014-06-05 07:55:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but maybe I shouldn't have complained to you about that stuff?
2014-06-05 07:57:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No definitely not. That didn't bother me at all.
2014-06-05 07:59:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This is probably one of those problems that stems from not physically seeing each other.
2014-06-05 08:01:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You shouldn't just stop replying when you don't like how the conversation is going though. 
2014-06-05 08:01:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tell me when you don't like the vibe, or want to change the topic
2014-06-05 08:04:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Alright, yeah that's my fault. I guess I want expedite for that to be the last time we talked.
2014-06-05 08:04:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Expecting*
2014-06-05 08:08:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I don't want to start today off on the wrong foot either 
2014-06-05 08:08:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can talk about this more after work if you want
2014-06-05 08:08:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We're not!
2014-06-05 08:09:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry. I wasn't trying to blame you or make you feel bad.
2014-06-05 08:09:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know it was my own fault!
2014-06-05 08:09:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You gave me a great start to my day with your messages.
2014-06-05 08:11:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're not making me feel bad. 
2014-06-05 08:11:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-06-05 08:11:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good. I love you too.
2014-06-05 18:09:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wanna Hangout a little?

2014-06-05 20:31:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Manu 3/3 on three pointers.
2014-06-05 20:32:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not good for the Heat if he's feeling it.

2014-06-05 21:03:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. Ctrl-f and then stream should take you to a comment with a bunch of links.
2014-06-05 21:03:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I'll find it for you.
2014-06-05 21:03:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is control f the buttons on my keyboard?
2014-06-05 21:03:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha or an actual clickable link
2014-06-05 21:04:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Keyboard. My bad.
2014-06-05 21:05:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like the key combo you use to find things in a document or on a webpage.
2014-06-05 21:05:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It might be command f on a Mac I guess. I didn't think about that.
2014-06-05 21:06:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhhhhhhhh
2014-06-05 21:06:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found it

2014-06-05 21:08:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's the bar?
2014-06-05 21:08:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ctrl-f is the computer literate thing to say ;)
2014-06-05 21:08:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What happened to Jesus's nose???
2014-06-05 21:09:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Bar's pretty good. Lots of TVs.
2014-06-05 21:10:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I didn't notice he had something wrong with his nose.
2014-06-05 21:11:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought maybe there was some epic foul i missed
2014-06-05 21:12:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nope. He did hit a wide open three exactly like you'd expect, though.
2014-06-05 21:17:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My man
2014-06-05 21:37:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Malfunctioning A/C!

2014-06-05 21:37:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's so funny
2014-06-05 21:42:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What??
2014-06-05 21:42:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just started it again
2014-06-05 21:42:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, the A/C is busted in the building.
2014-06-05 21:43:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause they can't take the HEATTTT
2014-06-05 21:43:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you got a genuine laugh out of me
2014-06-05 21:46:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are like five wildlife refuges in the same general area near Kitty Hawk
2014-06-05 21:55:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude
2014-06-05 21:58:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-06-05 22:04:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll make me want to go camping with you
2014-06-05 22:04:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, haha.
2014-06-05 22:04:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're in Costa Rica!!

2014-06-05 22:06:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*camping
2014-06-05 22:06:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think the camping is gonna be great.
2014-06-05 22:07:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not gonna be a primitive site.
2014-06-05 22:07:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which is what I prefer.
2014-06-05 22:07:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it'll still be good I'm sure.
2014-06-05 22:14:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how many more days until I get to see your naked ass?
2014-06-05 22:14:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn!
2014-06-05 22:15:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Michael!!
2014-06-05 22:15:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😉 
2014-06-05 22:15:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the answer is 13
2014-06-05 22:16:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]too many
2014-06-05 22:25:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Danny Green in da house
2014-06-05 22:26:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]DANNY GREEN IN DA HOUSE
2014-06-05 22:29:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My internet is not working and I'm about to cry
2014-06-05 22:29:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man. That really sucks.
2014-06-05 22:30:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]LeBron is cramping up hardcore.
2014-06-05 22:31:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Heat had to foul because he couldn't get up the floor.
2014-06-05 22:33:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Danny Green 4/4 on treys in the 4th
2014-06-05 22:33:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This ballgame might be over if LBJ is out
2014-06-05 22:33:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck
2014-06-05 22:34:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Drink some water!
2014-06-05 22:34:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Gatorade!!
2014-06-05 22:34:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-06-05 22:37:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you watching?
2014-06-05 22:38:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, through jerkiness and huge pixels and tears
2014-06-05 22:38:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-06-05 22:38:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Game 1 though
2014-06-05 22:38:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think this one's over
2014-06-05 22:38:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep
2014-06-05 22:39:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Saturday we're going to a pizza place which should have access to the game
2014-06-05 22:39:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. That'll be good.
2014-06-05 22:39:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm gonna see that Dawn of the Planet of the Apes with my movie ticket
2014-06-05 22:40:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not xmen??
2014-06-05 22:40:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking about that one, but I'd rather see Planet of the Apes
2014-06-05 22:41:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm mildly bummed I'm missing it in theaters, I loved the 1st couple xmen movies
2014-06-05 22:41:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think it won't still be in theaters when you get back?
2014-06-05 22:41:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yeah, trailers for planet of the apes looks really good too
2014-06-05 22:41:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, maybe 
2014-06-05 22:42:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Summer usually has faster turnover I feel like
2014-06-05 22:42:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not for blockbusters, though
2014-06-05 22:42:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they milk those things dry
2014-06-05 22:43:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It only came out May 23rd
2014-06-05 22:43:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'll definitely still be in theaters when you get back
2014-06-05 22:45:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll have to go with me
2014-06-05 22:45:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which means we'll have to put clothes on for a couple hours 
2014-06-05 22:47:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha damn! I guess I'll need a break at some point.
2014-06-05 22:52:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Miss you.
2014-06-05 22:59:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miss you too 
2014-06-05 23:00:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]New game 
2014-06-05 23:04:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where we look like kimdergateners
2014-06-05 23:41:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You asleep?
2014-06-05 23:49:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to bed, goodnight darling. Can't wait to watch basketball with you soon!
2014-06-06 07:13:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Whoops. I must've fallen asleep right after my last message.
2014-06-06 08:40:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm taking this new employee security/safety training and they literally just gave the definition of "hazard"
2014-06-06 08:40:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh man
2014-06-06 08:41:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty priceless 
2014-06-06 08:42:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, at the beginning it said there was going to be a quiz at the end... what they didn't tell me is that they would be giving me the answers. We don't even have the option to answer the question. Crazy people get paid to make this stuff.
2014-06-06 12:07:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My team went out for lunch today (more free food!) and the dude sitting next to me was Katie-close haha
2014-06-06 12:13:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What is Katie-close?
2014-06-06 12:14:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like legs wrapped around you running his fingers through your hair close?
2014-06-06 12:14:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-06-06 12:14:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good point.
2014-06-06 12:16:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Katie on the couch when we aren't having, haven't just had, or aren't about to have sex.
2014-06-06 12:18:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know of we've ever been on a couch together under those conditions 
2014-06-06 12:20:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha got me again!
2014-06-06 12:20:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except maybeee while we're eating, so I guess in that case I can imagine your lunch situation.
2014-06-06 12:22:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you :)
2014-06-06 12:22:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!
2014-06-06 16:43:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wait, is the phrase "trolling for pussy" or "trawling for pussy"
2014-06-06 16:58:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Where are all the non-single, but younger than 40 meetup groups?
2014-06-06 17:29:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can go to the under 40 singles groups too 
2014-06-06 17:30:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think that'd be very nice.
2014-06-06 17:30:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There are also young couples meetup groups.
2014-06-06 17:30:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though actually I'm a little bit concerned now if those comments are related somehow 
2014-06-06 17:31:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't fit in anywhere :(
2014-06-06 17:31:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nah. I didn't even know trawling was a word until today.
2014-06-06 17:31:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's why I was asking.
2014-06-06 17:32:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish you were here with me. I like doing things with you.
2014-06-06 17:32:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh honey
2014-06-06 17:32:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish I was there too
2014-06-06 17:32:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you talk to anyone at the bar last night? 
2014-06-06 17:33:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah. There was a couple to my left and some early thirties marketing bros to my right.
2014-06-06 17:34:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Singles meetups" aren't necessarily a bunch of people looking to hook up. 
2014-06-06 17:35:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But also I bet that softball league will be a good way to meet people 
2014-06-06 17:36:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I honestly don't really care if I make friends, lol. It's just easier to do things with groups I feel like.
2014-06-06 17:37:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel ya
2014-06-06 17:37:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do like seeing movies by myself sometimes 
2014-06-06 17:37:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I personally think both "trawling" and "trolling" apply, but trawling is funnier and makes a little more sense (probably because it is not a made up internet word)
2014-06-06 17:38:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah that statement definitely doesn't apply to all things.
2014-06-06 17:38:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Mostly urban/bar things.
2014-06-06 17:38:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Where being by yourself is kinda weird haha.
2014-06-06 17:39:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You should look up the Raleigh First Friday map and tell me what to do.
2014-06-06 17:39:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it tonight?
2014-06-06 17:40:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Right now. I'm walking around the state Capitol at the moment.
2014-06-06 17:42:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wish I was holding your hand 
2014-06-06 17:43:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww. Me too. A lot.
2014-06-06 17:43:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I like Raleigh.
2014-06-06 17:43:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm looking stuff up!
2014-06-06 17:45:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Crema on Fayetteville has free cone with purchase of ice cream
2014-06-06 17:46:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The Morning Times looks fun. Drink specials, outdoor art market, live music 
2014-06-06 17:46:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sounds good. I'm not sure how much of an incentive a free cone is though.
2014-06-06 17:46:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sounds cool too.
2014-06-06 17:48:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The Architect Bar and Social House, similar situation but looks a little more southern charm
2014-06-06 17:48:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]/more expensive
2014-06-06 17:49:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I'll do both!
2014-06-06 17:49:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you like those dueling piano like bars?
2014-06-06 17:50:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've actually never been to one.
2014-06-06 17:51:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're pretty fun, but I've only ever been with a group you can sing with and stuff
2014-06-06 17:52:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's one there called Rum Runners, free admission until 11p, half off all shots, beer specials. 
2014-06-06 17:52:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you don't go though maybe we can check it out while I'm there!
2014-06-06 17:53:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or you can scout it out first haha
2014-06-06 17:55:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. That'd be fun. I might check it out after those other places.
2014-06-06 17:56:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Playing some Outkast in the ice cream shop.
2014-06-06 17:57:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I can't believe you actually went to get ice cream. I'm pretty jealous
2014-06-06 17:57:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Free cone! https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-ZbpoezEgJWo/U5JHTpYl9BI/AAAAAAAAUkg/KUsXNeNd6lE/s0/2014-06-06
2014-06-06 17:59:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Rocky road??
2014-06-06 17:59:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Chocolate with pecans and dark chocolate chips.
2014-06-06 18:00:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meh
2014-06-06 18:00:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-06-06 18:06:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dude, you gotta see these pics Justin took on his most recent hike.
2014-06-06 18:06:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can I friend him on Instagram? Or would that be too weird
2014-06-06 18:07:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was actually thinking about telling him to friend you on Facebook just now haha.
2014-06-06 18:07:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We should for real consider going to Montana, though.
2014-06-06 18:08:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm down.
2014-06-06 18:09:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]School starts the 25?
2014-06-06 18:09:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is that a Monday?
2014-06-06 18:13:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I looked it up
2014-06-06 18:14:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We could go sometime between 8/15-8/22
2014-06-06 18:15:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-06-06 18:16:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This Architect place has blues and bluegrass on Wednesday nights.
2014-06-06 18:16:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Half off Jim Beam bourbon and whiskey
2014-06-06 18:16:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whatttt
2014-06-06 18:16:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right now, or Wednesdays?
2014-06-06 18:19:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wednesdays
2014-06-06 18:20:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's awesome
2014-06-06 18:20:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm the only one here right now haha.
2014-06-06 18:20:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It looks pretty cool, though.
2014-06-06 18:21:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pretty hip vibe.
2014-06-06 18:24:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How many nights in Montana?
2014-06-06 18:24:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Actually it looks like they have an outside... with corn hole!
2014-06-06 18:24:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How many do you want?
2014-06-06 18:25:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're going there when I visit. No question. I love corn hole 
2014-06-06 18:25:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]4?
2014-06-06 18:25:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too!
2014-06-06 18:25:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I built a set in college.
2014-06-06 18:25:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd be down with that. Don't book anything until I talk to Justin, though.
2014-06-06 18:26:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I won't, I'm gonna talk to Elin too
2014-06-06 18:27:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Looks like cheapest we could get is $360 round trip 
2014-06-06 18:28:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With most flights over 400, so we should buy sooner rather than later
2014-06-06 18:29:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. I'll talk to Justin.
2014-06-06 18:35:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then we can get our camping in!
2014-06-06 18:40:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yesss.
2014-06-06 18:41:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When are the Perseids?
2014-06-06 18:42:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It peaks the 12
2014-06-06 18:44:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But the moon will be almost full
2014-06-06 18:45:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😭
2014-06-06 18:46:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And flights are already $438
2014-06-06 18:46:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which isn't terrible
2014-06-06 18:47:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They've already gone up?
2014-06-06 18:47:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sometimes they go back down we're still two months away.
2014-06-06 18:48:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well that's how much they are now for 8/11-8/16
2014-06-06 18:49:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. Well I'll talk to Justin and keep an eye on prices. Are those the best days for you?
2014-06-06 18:51:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd probably prefer like 8/18-8/22, cause I'll have just got back and will need to do sample storage and stuff
2014-06-06 18:51:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But seeing a meteor shower would be pretty great
2014-06-06 19:01:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We can just drive out somewhere, but the moon might ruin it.
2014-06-06 19:31:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They got circus shit going on. https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-iAJ8kA0V0HA/U5JdUsbtk1I/AAAAAAAAUk4/riL-IqqTRmA/s0/2014-06-06
2014-06-06 19:32:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's crazy that it's still light there when it was dark 45 min ago here!
2014-06-06 19:33:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dat higher latitude.
2014-06-06 19:34:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Got a very burning man esque vibe in this area
2014-06-06 19:36:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really? What makes you say that?
2014-06-06 19:39:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Circus stuff + drum circle
2014-06-06 19:40:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]People dressed goofy
2014-06-06 19:40:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hoopers
2014-06-06 19:41:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like a pretty fun scene
2014-06-06 19:42:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I associate burning man with fewer clothes and behavior not considered appropriate in public I guess
2014-06-06 19:44:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Eh, that's not really what it's about, though.
2014-06-06 19:44:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Supposed to be about self-expression etc.
2014-06-06 19:50:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know what it's about 
2014-06-06 19:50:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But for many people there, that's involved in their self expression 
2014-06-06 20:03:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]True.
2014-06-06 20:35:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This band is pretty good. The rhythm section is killing it.
2014-06-06 21:11:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That video of cats sleeping in the dogs
2014-06-06 21:11:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] ' beds is hilarious
2014-06-06 21:59:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I know, my mom texts me that all the time about Shadow
2014-06-06 21:59:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just got back from a night hike, and I held a snake!
2014-06-06 21:59:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awesome!!
2014-06-06 21:59:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what kind?
2014-06-06 21:59:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No idea haha 
2014-06-06 22:00:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm actually about to go out to the bar thouagh, last few nights and everything
2014-06-06 22:00:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You picked up a snake and didn't know what it was?!
2014-06-06 22:00:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-06-06 22:00:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone else picked it up 1st!
2014-06-06 22:00:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did they know what it was?
2014-06-06 22:00:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He was very nice 
2014-06-06 22:00:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, but it didn't look poisonous 
2014-06-06 22:00:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-06-06 22:01:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I gotta go though, I love you and I'll video you tomorrow!
2014-06-06 22:01:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-06-06 22:01:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have fun
2014-06-07 01:02:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Back
2014-06-07 01:02:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was the rest of 1st Friday?
2014-06-07 01:20:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a Clouded or Banded Slug Eater! 
2014-06-07 05:17:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]neat!
2014-06-07 09:56:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Morning darling 
2014-06-07 10:17:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good morning, sugar.
2014-06-07 10:24:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why were you awake at 6:15??
2014-06-07 10:24:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was your night?
2014-06-07 10:25:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha more like why was I awake before 5?
2014-06-07 10:26:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And the answer is I have no idea. I fell back after 7 and just woke up again.
2014-06-07 10:33:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You asked me if I was "an ass man" when we first started dating and I said "yes", but I think I'm actually a face man.
2014-06-07 10:36:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-07 10:37:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can get down with that
2014-06-07 10:38:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Last night was pretty fun
2014-06-07 10:38:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our professor who came out with us last time convinced the exPat who owns the bar to cook us an amazing feast
2014-06-07 10:39:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no shit
2014-06-07 10:40:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]grilled tuna, chicken, these amazing cheesy/meaty potatoes, homemade bread, wasabi ginger sauce, grilled veggies
2014-06-07 10:40:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and then this berry shit baked on top of the bread for dessert
2014-06-07 10:40:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and by shit I mean the tastiest thing I've ever eaten
2014-06-07 10:40:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I bet you were loving that.
2014-06-07 10:40:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you know it
2014-06-07 10:41:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I professed my love to that tuna at least 100 times
2014-06-07 10:41:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I wouldn't be surprised    😉 
2014-06-07 10:43:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so no dancing, but they were playing like 80s and 90s classic music videos on a projector, so lots of singing and swaying
2014-06-07 10:44:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]where did you see the band with the good rhythm section?
2014-06-07 10:48:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. So what's on the agenda for today?
2014-06-07 10:50:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]workshop now
2014-06-07 10:50:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]discussion in the afternoon about "the future of genetics in conservation"
2014-06-07 10:51:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and then everyone is going out to get pizza in town, where they might have the game on!
2014-06-07 10:52:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you?
2014-06-07 10:54:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice! Sounds like fun.
2014-06-07 10:59:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you're busy now?
2014-06-07 11:10:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh sorry. My phone has been fucking up all morning.
2014-06-07 11:11:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No plans, though.
2014-06-07 11:12:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no problem, I just didn't know why you weren't responding to my questions
2014-06-07 11:14:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just got some Cap'n Crunch from the grocery store.
2014-06-07 11:15:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]nom
2014-06-07 11:15:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you gonna get some ice cream and lucky charms for me? :)
2014-06-07 11:16:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Was planning on getting the Lucky Charms, is there a particular ice cream you want? We could always go out for ice cream too.
2014-06-07 11:17:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Any kind except strawberry or something with nuts would be good
2014-06-07 11:18:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely wouldn't mind going out, but I might want something to snack on while you're at work haha
2014-06-07 11:18:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. Well I usually get vanilla, but I feel like that's too boring for your tastes.
2014-06-07 11:18:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK.
2014-06-07 11:19:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]dude I love vanilla
2014-06-07 11:19:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]especially with hersheys sauce, but I would eat it straight
2014-06-07 11:22:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i would also eat the syrup straight
2014-06-07 11:22:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]...
2014-06-07 11:22:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word I'll pick some up. Probably get some caramel for myself too!
2014-06-07 11:22:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oooooo man
2014-06-07 11:24:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe make myself a Katie sundae ;)
2014-06-07 11:24:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah not really.
2014-06-07 11:24:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you don't want to get your sheets any messier
2014-06-07 11:24:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i understand
2014-06-07 11:25:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nah. Food play is like shower sex for me in that it sounds better in theory than it is in practice.
2014-06-07 11:27:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really need food to be involved to kiss and lick you all over, so why make things all sticky?
2014-06-07 11:36:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]messages like that make it hard to talk to you in class
2014-06-07 11:36:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha
2014-06-07 11:36:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but you make a very valid point
2014-06-07 11:36:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha my bad!
2014-06-07 11:38:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and makes it harder for me to concentrate
2014-06-07 11:38:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP];)
2014-06-07 11:41:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well I don't want to be a bad influence, butttt I do like getting you going    😉 
2014-06-07 11:45:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh! less of a turn on for you, but can I give you feedback on your BJs sometime?
2014-06-07 12:06:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you really didn't understand the comment about inappropriate messages on my computer when people sit behind me lol
2014-06-07 12:07:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-07 12:07:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no I did not
2014-06-07 12:07:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]class is done now though
2014-06-07 12:08:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]is it positive feedback, or advice feedback?
2014-06-07 12:08:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd take either, but preferably in person
2014-06-07 12:09:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sure, we can talk about it when you're here    😃 
2014-06-07 12:10:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's not a bad thing though, right?
2014-06-07 12:11:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like I've actually been causing you pain and doing them completely wrong?
2014-06-07 12:12:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha not completely wrong! But there are a few things that are easy to do different that could make them better.
2014-06-07 12:12:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]At least I think so, I don't have a lot of experience giving head.
2014-06-07 12:14:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*make them more enjoyable for you
2014-06-07 12:15:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]huh?
2014-06-07 12:17:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]nothing, I guess I set myself up with the "completely wrong" question.
2014-06-07 12:17:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I obviously want to make you feel as good as you make me, so we can def talk about it when I'm there
2014-06-07 12:17:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-06-07 12:17:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're not upset are yoU?
2014-06-07 12:18:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no no no
2014-06-07 12:19:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok cool
2014-06-07 12:21:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, so I actually read this this reddit post about giving BJs several months ago and it all sort of made sense to me, so I'm gonna share it with you and hopefully it'll help me explain things better in person ->  http://www.reddit.com/r/howto/comments/1phb1y/how_to_give_an_epic_blowjob_response_to_whats/
2014-06-07 12:22:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don;t really feel like reading this right now
2014-06-07 12:22:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not telling you to read it right now
2014-06-07 12:22:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I'll look at it later
2014-06-07 12:36:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry, I don't know why I took this a little personally. Part of it is that I thought you particularly enjoyed it when I did that and now I'm reevaluating every time I gave you oral. I also would never email you an article on Eating Out Basics as if you were a 16 yr old boy who didn't know what a vagina was. I know you didn't mean it like that at all, but that's how it feels to me right now.
2014-06-07 12:37:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok... well, I didn't mean to make you feel bad.
2014-06-07 12:38:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would gladly welcome an article from you if you thought it would help me make you enjoy some aspect of our relationship more, sexual or not.
2014-06-07 12:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was hesitant to even bring this up because I knew it might make you upset, but that is sort of not a good idea, in my opinion
2014-06-07 12:39:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]communication about sex stuff is important
2014-06-07 12:39:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]communication in general is important
2014-06-07 12:39:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we've been pretty open about everything
2014-06-07 12:39:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I just want to bring sex into that mix
2014-06-07 12:39:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]our sex life is obviously great already
2014-06-07 12:40:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's not like I'm miserable or anything
2014-06-07 12:40:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really appreciate you're enthusiasm for giving head
2014-06-07 12:40:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is most of the battle anyway
2014-06-07 12:40:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*your
2014-06-07 12:40:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I just wanted to start a dialogoue
2014-06-07 12:40:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry I hurt your feelings
2014-06-07 12:43:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's really important, and I think we should be really open about that aspect of our relationship. But there's a better time and place to have that conversation, and slightly better ways to do it.
2014-06-07 12:43:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*more respectful ways
2014-06-07 12:44:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, well I don't know what those ways are, so feel free to fill me in
2014-06-07 12:49:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't send me a general article about how to give a blowjob so I can study it. I've given plenty of successful ones in my life and am pretty sure I actually incorporate most of that stuff anyways. When we're in person, tell me or show me what  you  particularly like and want me to do. Then I can show you what  I  want you to do.
2014-06-07 12:50:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's sexier and more fun  
2014-06-07 12:50:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm  ok
2014-06-07 12:56:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-06-07 12:56:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too
2014-06-07 13:49:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha poor dog
2014-06-07 13:55:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]every day
2014-06-07 13:55:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I ask mom why she won't just buy the cat a new bed, cause clearly he's too old to sleep on the laundry machine anymore
2014-06-07 13:56:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because the kitty likes that bed obviously
2014-06-07 14:08:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah but then she could buy the dog a new bed
2014-06-07 14:08:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so the dog doesn't have to sleep on the tile floor
2014-06-07 14:23:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If we want to video, I can do it now until 2 or like 4-5
2014-06-07 14:24:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok maybe later. I'm not really feeling it right now.
2014-06-07 14:25:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I shouldn't have told you off like that
2014-06-07 14:25:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could've been a little nicer about it
2014-06-07 14:26:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's ok, it's good you let me know I hurt your feelings
2014-06-07 14:35:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I took it too personally
2014-06-07 14:37:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean, how you feel is how you feel. Nothing wrong with that.
2014-06-07 16:59:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll be free for the next 45 min ish if you want to chat. If you're not feeling it, it's totally ok I should have some time tm
2014-06-07 16:59:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can video now
2014-06-07 18:25:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The game isn't on tonight haha
2014-06-07 21:35:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know!!! How did none of us realize that?
2014-06-07 21:35:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And those are absolutely adorable 
2014-06-07 21:35:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you so much 
2014-06-07 21:35:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-06-07 21:35:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too
2014-06-07 21:35:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I guess I had just assumed and never checked
2014-06-07 21:36:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and when you said it would be on at the pizza place I assumed you had checked
2014-06-07 21:36:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had the dates wrong

2014-06-08 02:46:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got back. That place sounds super fun! And maybe even Tuesgayz level with the right group
2014-06-08 02:47:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I ate literally 9 pizzas at drinker 
2014-06-08 02:47:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*dinner
2014-06-08 02:47:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And was fighting the results all night 
2014-06-08 02:48:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But oh man did we dance
2014-06-08 02:48:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I sang Where is the Love
2014-06-08 02:48:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*9 pizza slices lol
2014-06-08 02:49:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't have the energy to boot my  computer on to draw you a pic, but it would probably look terrible now anyways
2014-06-08 02:50:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yours made me smile so much though
2014-06-08 02:50:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you, goodnight!

2014-06-08 18:50:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll be hanging around the hotel tomorrow, so we can at least catch up then!
2014-06-08 18:50:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]After you get out of work

2014-06-08 18:56:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all good!
2014-06-08 18:56:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha ooooh. I'm excited
2014-06-08 18:58:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you already send the snap?
2014-06-08 21:29:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you and miss you a lot.
2014-06-08 21:32:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't wait until you're here and I have you in my arms. I don't think I'm gonna be able to let you go again.
2014-06-08 22:11:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It didn't send! The internet here is pretty mediocre 
2014-06-08 22:11:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it should be there now haha
2014-06-08 22:11:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah just got it.
2014-06-08 22:13:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Taking a break before heading out again?
2014-06-08 22:13:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You took a screenshot!

2014-06-08 22:23:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did! They had it on the whole time we were in Fridays 
2014-06-08 22:24:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. That was a good game.
2014-06-08 22:25:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some shitty playing on both sides at points, but I was happy with the end result 
2014-06-08 22:25:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, there were a lot of really good plays too, though, I thought
2014-06-08 22:27:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good plays, but crappy passes and like 3+ min where no one scored 
2014-06-08 22:27:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm so burnt out right now though, a big Part of me wishes I was heading home tm too
2014-06-08 22:27:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man. I bet. I
2014-06-08 22:28:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]'ve been pretty impressed with your ability to maintain.
2014-06-08 22:28:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hopefully this week will be a little more relaxing even though you're still gonna be travelling and stuff
2014-06-08 22:29:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah, more time sleeping on a beach for sure
2014-06-08 22:30:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'll be nice    😃 
2014-06-08 22:31:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so how was the bus ride?
2014-06-08 22:36:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Saw a crocodile by the road and we stopped by a beach to eat lunch
2014-06-08 22:36:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish I could Hangout with you tonight, but the internet is do slow it would be a mess
2014-06-08 22:36:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Long, but ok
2014-06-08 22:36:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's ok, sugar

2014-06-08 22:41:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hung out with Jon and Katie for a bit today
2014-06-08 22:42:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]had 2.5 beers took a two hour nap when I got back and felt like absolute garbage for most of the night
2014-06-08 22:44:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure you can guess my response to that
2014-06-08 22:44:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, suck it up?
2014-06-08 22:44:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's fun you got to hang out with them though
2014-06-08 22:44:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I almost vommed
2014-06-08 22:44:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hydrate!
2014-06-08 22:44:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seriously just 2.5 beers wrecked me
2014-06-08 22:45:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-06-08 22:45:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh no :/

2014-06-08 22:46:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah it seems to bring on the hangover
2014-06-08 22:47:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just ate some Taco Bell so I think I've recovered
2014-06-08 22:59:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Blegh
2014-06-08 22:59:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've been spoiled with the lack of processes cheesy foods 
2014-06-08 22:59:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha
2014-06-08 22:59:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eating pizza yesterday and Fridays today made me feel so heavy
2014-06-08 23:00:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did I tell you how many slices of pizza I ate
2014-06-08 23:00:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]?
2014-06-08 23:00:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol yeah 9
2014-06-08 23:00:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's pretty impressive.
2014-06-08 23:03:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too many
2014-06-08 23:03:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright my dear, I'm drifting fast
2014-06-08 23:03:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK, hon. I love you so much.
2014-06-08 23:04:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you, and thanks for the sweet words earlier. I can't wait to be in your arms!
2014-06-08 23:05:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet dreams, beautiful 😘
2014-06-09 07:23:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good morning, love. I hope you sleep in nice and late.
2014-06-09 09:46:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good morning. I didn't quite sleep in as much as I wanted, but about to take another nap now!
2014-06-09 09:50:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There you go!
2014-06-09 09:54:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A dude sent out an email like 5 minutes ago saying he was giving a bunch of games away for free, and they were all already gone by the time I got there haha. One of the downsides of being around a bunch of computer people I guess!
2014-06-09 15:16:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha figures
2014-06-09 15:16:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Walked to the city center with someone from the course, which was cool
2014-06-09 15:16:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now waiting on Veronica!
2014-06-09 16:24:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. So you think we're gonna video today?
2014-06-09 16:25:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you home?
2014-06-09 16:26:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No. I'm just wondering if I should be home at a certain time.
2014-06-09 16:27:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well Veronica will probably be here in like 30 min, and then Daniel in like 1.5 hours. So we could possibly video a little before they get here, or after we get back from dinner/whatever we do tonight
2014-06-09 16:28:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will you be pretty bummed if we don't?
2014-06-09 16:28:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. No worries. I just wanted to make sure I wasn't missing my chance :)
2014-06-09 16:29:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Of course I'll be bummed!
2014-06-09 16:29:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you still at work
2014-06-09 16:30:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I am. It's really OK. You have fun and if you find yourself with some down time this week and want to video let me know.
2014-06-09 16:31:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well text me when you get home, and I'll try to squeeze in at least a wave and an air kiss. I wanna see that handsome face
2014-06-09 16:33:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I'll be home before Veronica is there. Maybe exchange some snaps?
2014-06-09 16:34:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh and check your mail! My shoes and something else should be heading your way
2014-06-09 16:35:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. I'll be on the lookout.
2014-06-09 16:40:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks for being so flexible and not pouty about how much we video or chat. It makes this trip even more enjoyable for me, despite me missing you so much too!
2014-06-09 16:44:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No problem, sugar :) I'm hoping we'll have the chance to make up for lost time in the future.

2014-06-10 06:55:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you.
2014-06-10 13:43:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!
2014-06-10 13:49:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D that pic makes me feel like I'm falling in love with you all over again
2014-06-10 18:26:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)))
2014-06-10 18:27:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought about you a lot today
2014-06-10 18:28:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And how much fun we'd have traveling together 
2014-06-10 18:28:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, promise we'll get to do a bunch of that in the future?
2014-06-10 18:57:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I promise if you promise
2014-06-10 18:58:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]deal    😃 
2014-06-10 19:12:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!

2014-06-10 23:11:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You awake?
2014-06-11 06:28:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know you are cause you just liked all my Facebook pictures!
2014-06-11 06:28:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well now I'm awake!
2014-06-11 06:28:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WTF are you doing up?
2014-06-11 06:28:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Veronica was just sick 
2014-06-11 06:29:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah, bummer. Y'all go hard last night?
2014-06-11 06:31:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, Daniel and I went to bed at like 10:30, and she said she was just going to hang outside with ppl for a little bit but I don't know when she went to bed 
2014-06-11 06:31:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might be food poisoning, but we've eaten all the same food 
2014-06-11 06:32:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I hope she feels better.
2014-06-11 06:32:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah me too
2014-06-11 06:32:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was your evening?
2014-06-11 06:33:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That picture of you with the pizza is hilarious, by the way.
2014-06-11 06:33:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At the CR bar, in my green shirt?
2014-06-11 06:34:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not pizza, it's that heavenly berry dessert I was telling you about. Haha but I knew you'd recognize that look on my face
2014-06-11 06:34:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of per happiness
2014-06-11 06:34:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*pure
2014-06-11 06:35:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha yeah that's exactly what I thought!
2014-06-11 06:35:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So good....
2014-06-11 06:36:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As for yesterday, it's been a little rough already, the personality of the group is not condusive to traveling 
2014-06-11 06:36:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. How so?
2014-06-11 06:36:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aka I really really wish it were just me and Daniel, or that Elin had come
2014-06-11 06:37:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's kinda what you expected, right?
2014-06-11 06:37:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Veronica and mines personalities have diverged even more than they were in high school.
2014-06-11 06:38:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's not too surprising. Maybe just lay down the law a bit, though? You shouldn't let that get in the way of you and your bro having the experience you want.
2014-06-11 06:40:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Laying down the law isn't the problem. She's loud, expects service and everything to be the same here as it is in the US, teases both of us for "talking about weird things", tells embarrassing stories about me from high school to my OTS friends, and wants to eat at expensive places with American food
2014-06-11 06:42:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah, yeah that's kinda obnoxious it sounds like.
2014-06-11 06:42:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And just talks incessantly, when as I'm sure you know I appreciate/need at least some companionable silence during the day
2014-06-11 06:42:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Daniel even more so
2014-06-11 06:42:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Talking about weird things"? What does that even mean?haha
2014-06-11 06:43:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, for sure.
2014-06-11 06:43:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Daniel and I had a conversation about Bayes theorem at breakfast  
2014-06-11 06:43:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice #
2014-06-11 06:43:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]!
2014-06-11 06:44:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's kinda nerdy I guess, but you're in a PhD program for evolutionary biology... that's who you are!
2014-06-11 06:45:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know that we can still have a good time, and I'm not gonna let  this ruin the trip
2014-06-11 06:45:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it feels nice to complain a little and get it out
2014-06-11 06:49:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you 😘
2014-06-11 06:50:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you

2014-06-11 17:34:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is the oyster thing someone you've been emailing with?
2014-06-11 17:37:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He was recommended to me, he got his dissertation at UW and then went into commercial work in Hawaii
2014-06-11 17:37:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-06-11 17:38:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I forwarded you the email, sounds like an interesting dude. And oyster drama!
2014-06-11 17:38:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw snap
2014-06-11 17:39:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you have going on this evening?
2014-06-11 17:42:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha he does some like an interesting dude
2014-06-11 17:42:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's another example of my self-selecting hypothesis
2014-06-11 18:10:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As in he didn't like the academic atmosphere?
2014-06-11 18:10:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-06-11 18:32:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The money may have been a factor
2014-06-11 18:33:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you're right, very interesting dude. Not sure how much I want to talk for a couple hours lol
2014-06-11 18:33:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe he just wanted to make sure you didn't feel time constrained
2014-06-11 18:47:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Got another unsolicited interview request today.
2014-06-11 22:03:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah?
2014-06-11 22:03:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol at this convo
2014-06-11 22:04:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry
2014-06-11 22:34:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No need to be snarky about it, I'm trying to talk to you when I ca 
2014-06-11 22:34:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*can
2014-06-11 22:35:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not being snarky, there was like a 3.5 hour gap between messages
2014-06-11 22:36:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know
2014-06-11 22:36:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was eating dinner
2014-06-11 22:36:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was dinner?
2014-06-11 22:37:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was good, cheap but great tex mex with people from the course 
2014-06-11 22:37:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Id like to hear more about your job offer when you have time
2014-06-11 22:38:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even remember the name of the company, I told them I had an internship and they said thanks for my time
2014-06-11 22:39:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They called you?
2014-06-11 22:39:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-06-11 22:41:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to now?
2014-06-11 22:42:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got done playing some card games. We were thinking of going to this reggae night, but no ones really feeling it
2014-06-11 22:43:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tired out?
2014-06-11 22:44:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe it's from the course, but I'm just really not up for super extroverted activities 
2014-06-11 22:44:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And meeting new people
2014-06-11 22:45:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, does seeing reggae mean you have to meet new people?
2014-06-11 22:46:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Veronica and I would be going with this group of people she's been chilling with at the hostel 
2014-06-11 22:47:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And one of them already kinda tried to hit on me
2014-06-11 22:48:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know the "overly stimulated socially" thing is not something you really relate to
2014-06-11 22:49:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not how I operate, but that doesn't mean I can't sympathize
2014-06-11 22:49:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is the hostel situation?
2014-06-11 22:50:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never stayed in one.
2014-06-11 22:50:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's a part of not travelling outside the country, haha.
2014-06-11 22:52:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's pretty chill, and when I've been at ones before I've totally been down to integrate with the group and meet new people. But I feel like I've been living in a hostel for 2 weeks already
2014-06-11 22:52:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm also really enjoying bonding with the bro
2014-06-11 22:53:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's good
2014-06-11 22:54:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I invented an algorithm today
2014-06-11 22:54:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or at least independently arrived at one
2014-06-11 22:56:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty exciting!
2014-06-11 22:57:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it was. Gotta test it some more tomorrow, but it had really good results on the first data I tested it on.
2014-06-11 22:58:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bragged about it to Daniel 
2014-06-11 22:58:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He wants to know if you "like using it"
2014-06-11 22:59:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw, that's sweet    😃 
2014-06-11 22:59:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-11 22:59:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's kinda a funny question.
2014-06-11 22:59:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I liked writing it.
2014-06-11 22:59:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I'll be happy if it works well.
2014-06-11 23:00:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But "using" it just means running a program, which isn't all that exciting.
2014-06-11 23:00:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Ok"
2014-06-11 23:01:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-11 23:02:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a funny question though I agree
2014-06-11 23:02:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's actually a pretty interesting question the more I think about it
2014-06-11 23:02:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll be lying next to you a week from today!
2014-06-11 23:02:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-06-11 23:03:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I cannot effing wait.
2014-06-11 23:04:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's the 12th here now
2014-06-11 23:04:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So close
2014-06-11 23:05:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't think you got what I was saying
2014-06-11 23:05:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's out anniversary!
2014-06-11 23:06:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yay!
2014-06-11 23:06:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or mensiversary I guess  https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/mensiversary
2014-06-11 23:07:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you still into me?
2014-06-11 23:08:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybeeeee
2014-06-11 23:08:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-06-11 23:08:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe fading a little?
2014-06-11 23:09:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of course not
2014-06-11 23:09:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you so much 
2014-06-11 23:10:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never heard of mensivery 
2014-06-11 23:10:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like it
2014-06-11 23:10:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I had to look it up
2014-06-11 23:10:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's what I would've guessed the word to be
2014-06-11 23:11:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if it's actually a word or not
2014-06-11 23:11:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought it had to do with my menstrual cycle lol
2014-06-11 23:11:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-06-11 23:11:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they share the same root
2014-06-11 23:12:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good ol Latin
2014-06-11 23:12:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-06-11 23:13:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't like how the Hangouts Chrome extension automatically subs in emoji for my emoticons
2014-06-11 23:14:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I never use it 
2014-06-11 23:14:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mostly just this one    😀 
2014-06-11 23:14:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I always assumed you meant to use emojis 
2014-06-11 23:14:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want this guy : D
2014-06-11 23:14:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but without the space
2014-06-11 23:14:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They have the same connotation to me
2014-06-11 23:15:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, but the emoji looks kinda manic
2014-06-11 23:15:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the sideways one just looks really happy
2014-06-11 23:15:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wrote like a 2,500 word blog post
2014-06-11 23:15:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-06-11 23:15:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meh
2014-06-11 23:15:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for work
2014-06-11 23:16:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For the promo thing?
2014-06-11 23:16:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no for my project
2014-06-11 23:16:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I sent Mike a progress update Monday basically saying the same stuff I told you
2014-06-11 23:17:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he said it was good info and that I should write a blog post with my thoughts and things I encounter
2014-06-11 23:17:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I basically went HAM
2014-06-11 23:17:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-06-11 23:17:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go big or go home
2014-06-11 23:17:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt
2014-06-11 23:18:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that was before I even came up with that algorithm today, so that might be its own post depending on how it works
2014-06-11 23:19:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who else reads the blog?
2014-06-11 23:19:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]anyone on the Red Hat intranet can
2014-06-11 23:19:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I sent a link out to our team in our IRC channel
2014-06-11 23:20:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my team
2014-06-11 23:20:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]two of the other interns complimented me on it
2014-06-11 23:20:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and one of the full-time guys bookmarked it
2014-06-11 23:20:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Mike and Andrew haven't read it yet
2014-06-11 23:21:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's really sweet
2014-06-11 23:22:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like the open progress report mentality in businesses and research labs
2014-06-11 23:22:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah Red Hat is pretty awesome about that
2014-06-11 23:22:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Remind me sometime to tell you about this oyster lab at UW
2014-06-11 23:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there is a lot of collaboration
2014-06-11 23:22:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]makes sense, though, being an open source company
2014-06-11 23:22:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'll try to remember
2014-06-11 23:23:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I liked talking to you this morning
2014-06-11 23:23:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was a good start to my day
2014-06-11 23:24:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even though I was complaining so much?
2014-06-11 23:24:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah!
2014-06-11 23:24:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like that you can vent to me
2014-06-11 23:24:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like it too
2014-06-11 23:24:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And greatly appreciate it
2014-06-11 23:25:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-06-11 23:25:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess part of the reason is that I haven't had any idea whether or not I'm gonna really talk to you the past couple of weeks
2014-06-11 23:26:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it doesn't really bother me, but I guess it might subconsciously stress me out?
2014-06-11 23:26:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so getting in some convo in the morning was kinda a relief I guess
2014-06-11 23:26:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. It just made me feel good.
2014-06-11 23:27:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It made me feel a tiny tiny bit more like I was waking up next to you
2014-06-11 23:27:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw    😃 
2014-06-11 23:28:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm getting A little sleepy now though, too much sun and not enough sleep
2014-06-11 23:28:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight my love
2014-06-11 23:28:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Happy mensiversary :)

2014-06-12 17:24:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How are you doing?
2014-06-12 17:24:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We went to this really spectacular jungle waterfall today
2014-06-12 17:25:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel so clean and refreshed 
2014-06-12 17:25:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then Veronica lost the key to our hotel, but whatever 
2014-06-12 17:26:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]D'oh!
2014-06-12 17:26:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sounds awesome, though!
2014-06-12 17:29:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, definitely a good day
2014-06-12 17:29:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now resting while it's raining
2014-06-12 17:29:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hoping to make it out a little tonight
2014-06-12 17:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. They got clubs and shit around you?
2014-06-12 17:31:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah, very much a surfer town that we're in now
2014-06-12 17:31:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some bars and live music at night though 
2014-06-12 17:33:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's cool.
2014-06-12 17:38:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What day are you getting here?
2014-06-12 17:38:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a video of me jumping off a rope swing too I'll post later

2014-06-12 17:38:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I get there Wednesday 
2014-06-12 17:39:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That looks awesome!
2014-06-12 17:40:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Very picturesque.
2014-06-12 17:40:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is the water cold?
2014-06-12 17:40:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was pretty perfect
2014-06-12 17:41:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Slightly chilly, but the air was warm
2014-06-12 17:42:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool. Definitely jealous!
2014-06-12 17:43:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My flight gets in at 7:15p Wednesday 
2014-06-12 17:43:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You still picking me up??
2014-06-12 17:43:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. Should we go eat somewhere?
2014-06-12 17:44:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your bed
2014-06-12 17:44:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha sorry I couldn't help myself
2014-06-12 17:44:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-06-12 17:44:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I will definitely be hungry though
2014-06-12 17:45:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe drive through? Or you can grab something on the way to pick me up?
2014-06-12 17:46:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That works. I guess we can figure it out that day.
2014-06-12 17:47:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like how I had a nice dinner in mind and you suggest fast food, haha.
2014-06-12 17:47:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh if you want a nice dinner we can do that!
2014-06-12 17:48:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just thought that might be a Thursday activity
2014-06-12 17:48:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That works for me.
2014-06-12 17:49:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That way I have time to look all nice for you :)
2014-06-12 17:49:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-06-12 17:50:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's your day been?
2014-06-12 17:51:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pretty good. Made more progress on my project. I'm in Durham right now at that concert I told you about.
2014-06-12 17:52:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh that's right! Well I'll let you enjoy it without having to be all over your phone
2014-06-12 17:52:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't mind. I'm just sitting listening to the music.
2014-06-12 18:00:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it good?
2014-06-12 18:01:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. There's a break now so I'm grabbing food. This area is really cool. It's this like old labyrinthine industrial district that they've turned into an entertainment hub.
2014-06-12 18:02:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Walking around in it is pretty neat.
2014-06-12 18:03:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Labyrinthine"
2014-06-12 18:03:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like that word
2014-06-12 18:03:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I've never heard it before 
2014-06-12 18:05:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha that's so funny you said that. I thought to myself after I said that, "I bet she likes that"
2014-06-12 18:07:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)))
2014-06-12 18:07:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Think you know me pretty well, huh?
2014-06-12 18:08:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha a little.
2014-06-12 18:09:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not well enough to not have the occasional fuck up it seems, though!
2014-06-12 18:10:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] What?
2014-06-12 18:11:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Referring to our convo from the other day
2014-06-12 18:12:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh, I don't know if that's quite as bad as a "fuck up"
2014-06-12 18:14:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I think we both are still very much in the learning stage of the relationship, I certainly forgive you for that and had almost forgotten about it
2014-06-12 18:14:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well I guess that's as bad as it gets for us, so maybe my threshold is artificially deflated.
2014-06-12 18:17:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Artificially? Or relatively?  
2014-06-12 18:18:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Artificially if you're saying it wasn't a fuck up.
2014-06-12 18:18:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I seee
2014-06-12 18:21:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'd take a lot for a miscommunication like that to have a long lasting negative impact on me, because I'm pretty 100% confident you would never intend to make me feel bad
2014-06-12 18:22:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And because you make me so incredibly happy the other 99.999% of the time 
2014-06-12 18:23:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D I'm so glad you feel that way, the first part especially.
2014-06-12 18:25:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're so amazing, I'm never going to take that for granted.
2014-06-12 18:26:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-06-12 18:26:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't think I've had a chance to tell you yet today :)
2014-06-12 18:27:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're right! I love you too.
2014-06-12 18:42:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She doesn't even miss me....
2014-06-12 18:43:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-06-12 18:43:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe she just doesn't do the long distance thing ;)
2014-06-12 18:44:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, I certainly don't put in the time to video her like I do you
2014-06-12 18:45:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha poor Flo!
2014-06-12 18:46:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We should take a walk through this area while you're here.
2014-06-12 18:49:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]- walk and hold hands - go see a show and hold hands  - eat at a nice restaurant and hold hands - go out dancing (and hold lots of body parts) - go see xmen and hold hands 
2014-06-12 18:49:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha you're so goddamn adorable.
2014-06-12 18:53:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This is pretty much as good as it gets for me, minus the fact you're not here. Really interesting location, great atmosphere, great music, great crowd.
2014-06-12 18:54:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like what a cool spot, right?
2014-06-12 18:55:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And a lucky strike factory? How very Tobacco Road
2014-06-12 18:55:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's pretty sweet looking
2014-06-12 18:56:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah this is the American Tobacco Historic District
2014-06-12 18:57:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They got an outdoor basketball court right here too.
2014-06-12 18:57:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should play!
2014-06-12 18:57:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It looks like it's only open at certain times.
2014-06-12 22:21:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This game
2014-06-12 22:22:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm over it 
2014-06-12 22:22:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ick
2014-06-12 22:22:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The whole sport
2014-06-12 22:22:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-12 22:22:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Heat suck
2014-06-12 22:22:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah.....
2014-06-12 22:22:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But now I'm just being the quintessential Heat fan
2014-06-12 22:22:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]By not defending them 
2014-06-12 22:23:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they were booing!
2014-06-12 22:23:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At their worst 
2014-06-12 22:23:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha don't know how to deal with pain
2014-06-12 22:23:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a good way of putting it
2014-06-12 22:23:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where are you watching the game?
2014-06-12 22:24:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you must be at the hostel if you're talking to me
2014-06-12 22:25:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Veronica went on a walk and never came back, so Daniel and I eventually decided to get food. And we ran into her leaving this bar with a surfer dude and she said don't wait up. So Daniel and I went to this awesome little bar and watched the first half and got kinda tipsy and are wAy too much guac
2014-06-12 22:26:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then sat on the beach and chatted about life
2014-06-12 22:26:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And now we're back at the hotel 
2014-06-12 22:26:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sounds like a good time
2014-06-12 22:26:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the Veronica situation sorted itself out?
2014-06-12 22:27:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-06-12 22:28:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, which is what I expected to happen eventually
2014-06-12 22:28:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We missed the sunset waiting around for her though 
2014-06-12 22:28:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which is no burno
2014-06-12 22:28:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man.
2014-06-12 22:28:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*bueno
2014-06-12 22:28:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how's the bro doing?
2014-06-12 22:29:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He's better
2014-06-12 22:29:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The waterfall and this town are way more up his ally
2014-06-12 22:29:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's cool
2014-06-12 22:30:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you said you weren't sure if the outdoorsy stuff was his scene
2014-06-12 22:30:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does it seem like that's the case?
2014-06-12 22:30:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is, but he requires a 2 hour nap every day
2014-06-12 22:30:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-06-12 22:30:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which occasionally overlaps with hiking time so he skips it
2014-06-12 22:31:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-06-12 22:31:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We decided we're not doing a canopy tour
2014-06-12 22:31:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except Veronica 
2014-06-12 22:31:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I feel like it'll be touristy and not really worth my money and he doesn't think it's his jam at all
2014-06-12 22:31:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it is kinda touristy
2014-06-12 22:32:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd rather get a ballin' hike in personally
2014-06-12 22:32:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]find a waterfall like y'all found
2014-06-12 22:32:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]look at some frogs and shit
2014-06-12 22:33:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is the second "and shit" you've said tonight

2014-06-12 22:33:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha

2014-06-12 22:35:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I missed two of your messages
2014-06-12 22:35:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"I have a video of me jumping off a rope swing too I'll post later New life goal: make love to you next to a waterfall  "
2014-06-12 22:35:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely want to see that video.
2014-06-12 22:35:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And wish I would've saw that second message when you originally sent it
2014-06-12 22:36:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sounds awesome    😀 
2014-06-12 22:36:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah I was surprised you didn't comment on it initially 
2014-06-12 22:38:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that pic of the rock is so effing sweet
2014-06-12 22:38:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:))

2014-06-12 22:38:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just wish I had better handwriting 
2014-06-12 22:39:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha

2014-06-12 22:39:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://gfycat.com/PartialPoorGrouper
2014-06-12 22:41:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do not love that
2014-06-12 22:41:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gotta respect it, though
2014-06-12 22:42:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah yeah
2014-06-12 22:42:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Spurs are a better team
2014-06-12 22:43:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still really want Miami to have this grata coming together moment in this series where they figure their shit out and have an almost underdog momoment 
2014-06-12 22:43:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*moment 
2014-06-12 22:43:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's still possible!
2014-06-12 22:43:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You can't give up!
2014-06-12 22:43:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not!
2014-06-12 22:43:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But this game was over since the 1st quarter 
2014-06-12 22:44:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-06-12 22:44:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder what the deal is
2014-06-12 22:44:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the last game the Spurs were on fire
2014-06-12 22:44:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there was nothing the Heat could really do
2014-06-12 22:47:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This game though, they really played like poop
2014-06-12 22:48:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Spurs had amazing D
2014-06-12 22:50:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]true true

2014-06-12 22:52:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whoa! He/She's sweet looking.
2014-06-12 22:52:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Couldn't flip it over to determine gender
2014-06-12 22:52:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They were fiesty
2014-06-12 22:53:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is gender used to describe animals?
2014-06-12 22:54:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sex
2014-06-12 22:56:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe not as much in scientific discussions 
2014-06-12 22:56:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I think gender is more like sociological
2014-06-12 23:00:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you mean pilsner on your check-in?
2014-06-12 23:01:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, Pilsen is a Costa Rican beer
2014-06-12 23:02:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh alright. That's pretty funny.
2014-06-12 23:03:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, it tastes like a "Pilsen" too
2014-06-12 23:06:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm gonna go to sleep. What are you up to tomorrow?

2014-06-12 23:13:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. Looks like fun. And I like how your life goal was to specifically make love to me at a waterfall and not just make love at a waterfall in general.
2014-06-12 23:13:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you. Sweet dreams.
2014-06-12 23:14:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm optimistically hoping you'll be with me at most waterfalls in my future  
2014-06-12 23:15:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you
2014-06-12 23:15:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘

2014-06-13 19:25:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's intriguing
2014-06-13 19:26:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Veronica didn't show up this morning, so just Daniel and I went on the horseback riding/waterfall tour
2014-06-13 19:27:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which was great to have a break from her in of itself, but the tour was perfect
2014-06-13 19:27:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I jumped from like 10 m off a ledge on this huge waterfall
2014-06-13 19:27:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whoa!
2014-06-13 19:28:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's high
2014-06-13 19:28:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And rode on the back of a motorcycle cause the car to the stables was full 
2014-06-13 19:28:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And ate some amazing home cooked food
2014-06-13 19:29:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice... sounds like a lot of fun!
2014-06-13 19:29:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bad parts: after we got back, I locked the spare key in the room (D'oh) and Daniel got terrible food poisoning so was miserable 
2014-06-13 19:30:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man
2014-06-13 19:30:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Actually, I'm gonna grab a quick bite, then do you want to video? The thought of maybe seeing your face tonight was kinda getting me through 
2014-06-13 19:30:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, we can do dthat
2014-06-13 19:30:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You didn't have evening plans, did you?

2014-06-13 21:08:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd settle for a good ol fashion bed or couch

2014-06-13 21:09:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for sleeping on, right?

2014-06-13 21:10:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Seeing your face was definitely better than nothing though
2014-06-13 21:10:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And only 5 more nights apart
2014-06-13 21:11:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think my body just thinks you're gone forever
2014-06-13 21:12:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what does that feel like?
2014-06-13 21:12:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't know
2014-06-13 21:12:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like five days doesn't really feel any further or closer away than like ten days at this point
2014-06-13 21:13:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]2 days will feel much better
2014-06-13 21:13:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, probably
2014-06-13 21:13:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really want you inside of me again

2014-06-15 17:25:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I touched it and it felt like a slug
2014-06-15 17:25:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't really know my slugs very well
2014-06-15 17:26:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me neither, I bet Darcy would know though
2014-06-15 17:27:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But maybe I'm generalizing her research interests too much
2014-06-15 17:28:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Great pics

2014-06-15 17:38:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*smile. My fake laugh is a bit too neurotic

2014-06-16 10:06:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Putting on makeup for basically the 1st time in weeks is kinda weird
2014-06-16 10:23:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you have a free laundry machine?
2014-06-16 10:23:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP](I know you're working, you don't Have to answer right now)
2014-06-16 10:41:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, there's a washer and dryer in the apartment.
2014-06-16 10:41:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I can't say I know what it's like to put on makeup after a hiatus!
2014-06-16 10:46:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't wait to see youuuu
2014-06-16 12:30:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm almost glad I'm going to be so ridiculously busy the next couple of days, it'll make them go by way faster
2014-06-16 12:35:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Seems like that's been a trend with us.
2014-06-16 12:37:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm itchy
2014-06-16 20:24:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Itchy for me? Or bug bite itchy?

2014-06-16 20:25:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I used bug spray!
2014-06-16 20:26:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was it?
2014-06-16 20:26:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jon Mitchell saved the day again 
2014-06-16 20:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no surprise there
2014-06-16 20:26:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had to leave the couch by the dumpster bc no one offered to buy it :(
2014-06-16 20:26:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was sad to see it go
2014-06-16 20:27:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man

2014-06-16 20:30:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the bed you always talk crap about!
2014-06-16 20:30:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]poor bed
2014-06-16 20:30:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I talk shit about my bed in Katy
2014-06-16 20:30:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This one it's more appreciative jests 
2014-06-16 20:31:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha

2014-06-16 20:32:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't want to pack a wet towel when you leave, though
2014-06-16 20:33:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I probably need to anyways since I'll be living out of a suitcase for 6 weeks  😩🔫

2014-06-16 21:44:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How do I cook a frozen pizza? 
2014-06-16 21:44:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like temp/time?
2014-06-16 21:45:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know like 400 for 10?
2014-06-16 21:45:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]doesn't it say on the packaging?
2014-06-16 21:45:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No it's just in plastic wrap
2014-06-16 21:46:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it doesn't really matter
2014-06-16 21:46:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]...it's Darcy's but I'll buy another tomorrow!
2014-06-16 21:46:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's already safe to eat
2014-06-16 21:46:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I want it to taste as good as cardboard pizza can
2014-06-16 21:46:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-06-16 21:46:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really like frozen pizza
2014-06-16 21:47:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought hamburger helper and frozen pizza went hand in hand?
2014-06-16 21:47:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Orange juice!
2014-06-16 21:47:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess they probably usually do
2014-06-16 21:48:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if there's gonna be enough room in the fridge for all this
2014-06-16 21:48:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I knew you were begrudging!
2014-06-16 21:49:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is the kinda household where there's a lot of food that never seems to get eaten for some reason
2014-06-16 21:49:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just takes up space
2014-06-16 21:49:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ah, I'm aware of those
2014-06-16 21:50:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*familiar 
2014-06-16 21:50:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-06-16 21:50:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much
2014-06-16 21:50:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm so excited to see you
2014-06-16 21:50:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love how I've gotten you to incorporate dude into your vocabulary 
2014-06-16 21:51:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-06-16 21:51:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you cannot take credit for that
2014-06-16 21:51:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude
2014-06-16 21:51:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes I can
2014-06-16 21:51:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can
2014-06-16 21:51:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you would be incorrect
2014-06-16 21:51:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I remember when I 1st said dude you commented on it
2014-06-16 21:51:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can give you credit for yo
2014-06-16 21:51:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I commented on dope
2014-06-16 21:52:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm
2014-06-16 21:52:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my dad has been using dude since I was a kid
2014-06-16 21:52:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I have too
2014-06-16 21:52:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright fine, I concede 
2014-06-16 21:52:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok, well priority: eggs, orange juice, tortillas
2014-06-16 21:53:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lucky Charms
2014-06-16 21:53:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't take up fridge space
2014-06-16 21:53:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope
2014-06-16 21:53:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we should be good
2014-06-16 21:53:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can squeeze a little bag of cheese in there, can't you?
2014-06-16 21:54:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-06-16 21:54:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-06-16 21:54:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gosh I love you so much
2014-06-16 21:54:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yesss
2014-06-16 21:56:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking about the fact that we do and say all this "corny" stuff
2014-06-16 21:56:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm all about it yo
2014-06-16 21:56:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know why people wouldn't do those kinds of things
2014-06-16 21:56:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's fun
2014-06-16 21:56:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we get to let each other know how much we love each other
2014-06-16 21:57:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think sometimes people who knock it are a little jealous
2014-06-16 21:57:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah maybe
2014-06-16 21:58:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I think "corny" stuff can sometimes be fake or casual
2014-06-16 21:58:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-06-16 21:58:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which is not the case for us at least
2014-06-16 21:58:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess our sort of self-awareness when it comes to those types of things makes it a little different
2014-06-16 21:59:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's especially hard to contain my feelings about you for some reason
2014-06-16 22:00:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like we're both aware these things can be interpreted as superficial or whatever and we still do them in spite of that fact because we legitimately feel it'll make the other person happy
2014-06-16 22:01:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's pretty interesting
2014-06-16 22:01:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what you said
2014-06-16 22:02:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like harder for you in the past? Why do you think that is, if so?
2014-06-16 22:02:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Legitimately feel it would make the other person happy, and it is literally how I feel when I say them
2014-06-16 22:02:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't have to answer those questions
2014-06-16 22:02:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just what popped in my head
2014-06-16 22:02:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-06-16 22:02:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]same here
2014-06-16 22:03:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it makes ME feel good when I tell you I love you
2014-06-16 22:03:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is kinda weird to think about
2014-06-16 22:05:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm. It makes me feel good too, but it's more that I say these things because I know they aren't superficial or exaggerations of my feelings. In some cases they are underestimates. 
2014-06-16 22:06:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm trying to imagine what some of the things you say could be understatements for
2014-06-16 22:07:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well words aren't necessarily the best way to express a complex feeling such as love
2014-06-16 22:07:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially a short little phrase like "I love you so much"
2014-06-16 22:07:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]true
2014-06-16 22:07:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you do a pretty good job, though
2014-06-16 22:08:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm looking forward to doing it in person though :)
2014-06-16 22:08:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too
2014-06-16 22:09:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and expressing our love in all kinds of other ways that aren't possible through computer screens
2014-06-16 22:09:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly
2014-06-16 22:22:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh this pizza made me feel so much better. Goodnight my love, talking to you was so nice tonight. 
2014-06-16 22:24:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you. I'm sooooo excited to see you. Just two more work days.
2014-06-16 22:25:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I seriously can't wait. I'm more excited to see you after this gap then I have been on the past few.
2014-06-16 22:25:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*than
2014-06-16 22:26:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too 
2014-06-16 22:27:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃  I think that's about as good of a thing as you could ask for out of a long distance relationship
2014-06-16 22:27:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just wiggling like a worm in my chair 
2014-06-16 22:27:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha awww
2014-06-16 22:27:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish I could see it
2014-06-16 22:28:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't worry, I've saved up plenty of wiggles for you
2014-06-16 22:28:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yesss
2014-06-16 22:28:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]particularly of the involuntary kind I hope    😉 
2014-06-16 22:29:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those kind of wiggles are almost too stored up
2014-06-16 22:29:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You could probably get me to cum with a long hug 
2014-06-16 22:29:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-16 22:30:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well this should be fun    😃 
2014-06-16 22:30:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmmm
2014-06-16 22:31:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok now I really am gonna try to sleep, if only to make time go by faster.
2014-06-16 22:31:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooook
2014-06-16 22:31:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you. Sweet dreams, beautiful.
2014-06-16 22:31:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-06-16 22:31:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah 
2014-06-17 08:49:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I slept terrible, kept waking up and tossing and turning. I think it's because I don't have AC and went to be too excited about seeing you.
2014-06-17 08:52:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But now it's the 17! And tomorrow is the 18!
2014-06-17 08:53:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-06-17 08:56:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No AC sounds rough, but just make it through one more night and I promise you'll get some amazing post-sex, ass against me sleep when you get here.
2014-06-17 09:00:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I'm counting on it
2014-06-17 09:00:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you have AC, though? 
2014-06-17 09:00:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That might be a deal breaker...
2014-06-17 09:01:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Obviously. I'm in the South!
2014-06-17 09:02:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha good, just checking
2014-06-17 10:02:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you see my pic of the ghost crab?
2014-06-17 10:11:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No and I can't seem to find it
2014-06-17 10:11:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it in the google+ one?
2014-06-17 10:12:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-06-17 10:14:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I totally sent you that message while pooping at work, by the way.
2014-06-17 10:15:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I guess we're at the stage in our relationship where I say that kind of thing hahaha
2014-06-17 10:30:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm loling at that snap.
2014-06-17 10:30:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you.
2014-06-17 10:34:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-06-17 15:54:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This time tomorrow I'll be getting on a plane :)
2014-06-17 15:56:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yessss. I'm working two extra hours today and I'm gonna work until I pick you up tomorrow, so I can leave early on Thursday and Friday a couple of hours early.
2014-06-17 15:57:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I think I'm gonna do a half day on Monday and just work nine hour days the rest of the week.
2014-06-17 15:58:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you do that?
2014-06-17 15:59:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. We can do whatever we want pretty much. This one girl broke her arm and is going to be working from home for the next couple of weeks.
2014-06-17 16:00:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty sweet. So Monday afternoon is the session at evolution I most want to see, so maybe take the morning off?
2014-06-17 16:01:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, OK. Yeah, I can do that. When do you fly out Monday?
2014-06-17 16:20:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]7:30p I think
2014-06-17 16:23:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-06-17 17:15:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]  I think if we had been dating when Darcy first asked me to move in with her, I would've said no
2014-06-17 17:16:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because you want the place to yourself when I visit?
2014-06-17 17:21:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's partially it. And part of the reason I said yes was because I was getting really lonely and almost depressed during the winter 
2014-06-17 17:22:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I don't anticipate feeling that way while we're together 
2014-06-17 17:25:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw :(
2014-06-17 17:26:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually have had a similar change-of-heart, though.
2014-06-17 17:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I actually said something to you about it last semester.
2014-06-17 17:27:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]About moving into the dorms?
2014-06-17 17:27:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]About how being with you and talking with you made me feel better about living alone.
2014-06-17 17:27:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-06-17 17:28:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Where I live next year is more of a financial decision then a mental health one now haha
2014-06-17 17:29:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And are you only with me to combat the loneliness?! Maybe I'm your rebound ;)
2014-06-17 17:30:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I knew you'd say that haha
2014-06-17 17:31:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're definitely not a rebound, cause I'm not in the process of getting over someone (and haven't been for a while now)
2014-06-17 17:33:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I think I've mentioned before how you came into my life at just the right time, where I was ready to be in a serious relationship again 
2014-06-17 17:34:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I was j/k.
2014-06-17 17:34:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And that's pretty lucky for me, I guess!
2014-06-17 17:35:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Although, I definitely had a longer period of no opposite sex at all than you.
2014-06-17 17:37:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That doesn't mean I wasn't lonely or unhappy
2014-06-17 17:40:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's what I was saying. As far as one of us filling a void or whatever. I don't actually think that. Just messing around.
2014-06-17 17:41:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah ok, I don't really want to have a "who wanted to be in the relationship" more competition lol
2014-06-17 17:43:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha me neither. Don't really care! I'm happy with how things turned out.
2014-06-17 18:08:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What color towel you want?
2014-06-17 18:09:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What color is your towel?
2014-06-17 18:09:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yellar
2014-06-17 18:09:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah, duh
2014-06-17 18:09:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dark blue 
2014-06-17 18:09:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or green
2014-06-17 18:11:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They got both. They got varieties of each with lighter shade stripes too.
2014-06-17 18:13:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That green towel is mostly the darker green.
2014-06-17 18:13:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just those stripes are the lighter shade
2014-06-17 18:14:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whichever one is softer
2014-06-17 18:14:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or the blue one 
2014-06-17 18:14:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No stripes
2014-06-17 18:14:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol OK.
2014-06-17 18:14:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too many options
2014-06-17 18:15:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're telling me!
2014-06-17 18:16:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're going to drink my roommate's OJ because there are two huge jugs in the fridge.
2014-06-17 18:16:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I obviously have zero qualms about that 
2014-06-17 18:17:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As long as it's not expired....
2014-06-17 18:17:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah, they're new.
2014-06-17 18:18:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet
2014-06-17 18:18:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Too many tortilla options.
2014-06-17 18:18:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Need more details.
2014-06-17 18:19:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Homestyle flour? Now more soft & fluffy
2014-06-17 18:31:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I was loading boxes in the car. Flour, not corn
2014-06-17 18:31:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Soft and fluffy sounds decent
2014-06-17 18:33:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well that's what you're getting haha
2014-06-17 18:40:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What happened to the other yellow towel?
2014-06-17 18:45:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I packed it. Didn't think to bring two.
2014-06-17 18:49:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Less than 24 hours until I see yo pretty face!
2014-06-17 18:53:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ehh like 24.5
2014-06-17 18:59:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How do you figure?
2014-06-17 18:59:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah time change!
2014-06-17 19:06:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WTF I'm getting spammed hard by American Airlines and I've unsubscribed from all their lists.
2014-06-17 19:21:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Persistent bastards
2014-06-17 19:21:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whys you unsubscribe?
2014-06-17 19:22:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't do promotional emails
2014-06-17 19:22:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I can see that
2014-06-17 19:22:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can be a bit of a sucker for them
2014-06-17 19:22:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I can see that    😉 
2014-06-17 19:23:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you hear about this Slingshot app?
2014-06-17 19:23:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think so
2014-06-17 19:23:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it just came out today
2014-06-17 19:23:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Facebook made it
2014-06-17 19:23:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's like Snapchat
2014-06-17 19:23:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you can't see what the person sent you until you send something back
2014-06-17 19:24:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds stupid
2014-06-17 19:24:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like it
2014-06-17 19:24:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is that more stupid than Snapchat?
2014-06-17 19:24:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha snapchat is definitely silly
2014-06-17 19:25:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I like that I'm not committed to responding, and I can look at things whenever I feel like it
2014-06-17 19:25:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I waited a few days to look at a reply pic to my reply, I'd completely forget what started the whole thing
2014-06-17 19:26:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't see how that's necessarily different from Snapchat
2014-06-17 19:27:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Snapchat doesn't require or encourage a continuos "conversation"
2014-06-17 19:27:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-06-17 19:28:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha but since I enjoy having conversations with you, I might get it
2014-06-17 19:28:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But only to send pics to you
2014-06-17 19:28:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you don't need to get it
2014-06-17 19:28:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I honestly wish all the pics you sent me were on Hangouts
2014-06-17 19:29:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm
2014-06-17 19:52:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got this Froot Loops with Marshmallows cereal and I think it's my new fave
2014-06-17 20:17:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That sounds way too sweet fit me
2014-06-17 20:17:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*squirts chocolate syrup in her mouth
2014-06-17 20:42:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Chocolate itself is bitter, so the syrup is more balance IMO than marshmallow/fruity sugar cereal
2014-06-17 20:43:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And because of your comment I went and had some syrup  😻😻
2014-06-17 20:44:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-17 20:44:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're a nut
2014-06-17 20:44:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aww, cute QuickPay message
2014-06-17 20:44:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I forgot what it said
2014-06-17 20:44:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm glad you like it
2014-06-17 20:45:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just Chicago to Missoula (love you!)
2014-06-17 20:45:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my subleasor is getting a bit antsy
2014-06-17 20:46:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How so?
2014-06-17 20:46:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he sent an email at 1:00 this morning asking me to pay my July rent
2014-06-17 20:46:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he just sent me a Facebook message asking me again
2014-06-17 20:46:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even though the lease says pay by June 20th
2014-06-17 20:47:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's whatever, just kinda silly
2014-06-17 20:47:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha What? Boy's running out of money
2014-06-17 20:47:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like it
2014-06-17 20:48:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you have enough? I just deposited like $700 so I can send you the Delta $$ tm morning 
2014-06-17 20:48:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I charge everything
2014-06-17 20:48:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I have plenty of money until July 10th
2014-06-17 20:49:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at which point I should still be really comfortable as that'll be two more paychecks I think
2014-06-17 20:52:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok cool. I'll still send you that money in the next couple of days
2014-06-17 20:53:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]okey dokey
2014-06-17 20:54:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I've been lagging on the replies tonight. Being a busy bee
2014-06-17 20:54:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no worries, sugar
2014-06-17 20:55:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get to see you tomorrow!
2014-06-17 20:55:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it'll be exactly a month since we last saw each other
2014-06-17 20:55:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a long time!
2014-06-17 20:56:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it the longest since we started dating?
2014-06-17 20:56:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-06-17 20:57:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when did you get your car?
2014-06-17 20:57:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't have that on my calendar
2014-06-17 20:57:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]April 23
2014-06-17 20:57:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh
2014-06-17 20:58:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Then no that was the longest
2014-06-17 20:58:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wait no it wasn't
2014-06-17 20:58:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was almost a month
2014-06-17 20:58:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No because I left you on the 31
2014-06-17 20:58:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant before that
2014-06-17 20:58:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]3.5 weeks
2014-06-17 20:58:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your spring break
2014-06-17 20:58:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to getting the car
2014-06-17 20:58:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]24th to 23rd
2014-06-17 20:59:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh you're right, I had my break mixed up
2014-06-17 21:01:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We've been together 97 days
2014-06-17 21:01:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]been physically together 19
2014-06-17 21:01:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]19.6%
2014-06-17 21:02:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]actually less than that cuz a lot of those days are bookended by travel days
2014-06-17 21:03:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]prolly more like 16
2014-06-17 21:03:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]16.5%
2014-06-17 21:03:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I think it's around 16
2014-06-17 21:03:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well the next 3 visits should boost that percent a little!
2014-06-17 21:04:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this one probably won't boost it much
2014-06-17 21:05:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'll keep it from going down I guess
2014-06-17 21:05:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the two weeks will probably help
2014-06-17 21:06:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]23 days in 9 weeks
2014-06-17 21:06:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's a pretty good average
2014-06-17 21:06:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]relatively speaking
2014-06-17 21:08:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we need to hit 59 days to have spent 20% of our relationship physically together by the end of the year
2014-06-17 21:30:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]20% is kind of arbitrary, but it think we can get the other 20 days in no problem
2014-06-17 21:31:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With a sept visit, Halloween, thanksgiving, and something over winter break :)
2014-06-17 21:31:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, it's absolutely arbitrary, just a nice round number
2014-06-17 21:31:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and sort of interesting to think about
2014-06-17 21:31:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for me
2014-06-17 21:54:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least our sex/week average is still on par with an average relationship
2014-06-17 21:54:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe even above average haha
2014-06-17 21:55:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]About 14 weeks. So twice a week would be 28 times.
2014-06-17 21:58:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's probably below average for couples our age, but it's not terrible.
2014-06-17 22:01:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We've been physically together 16 days. At 3 times a day (a fair estimate, even including driving days) that's 39 times
2014-06-17 22:01:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So like 3 times a week 
2014-06-17 22:01:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Actually, twice a week puts us in the top 40-33 percentile for couples our age.
2014-06-17 22:02:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html
2014-06-17 22:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You think we average three times a day?
2014-06-17 22:02:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Absolutely 
2014-06-17 22:02:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that's only counting your orgasms 
2014-06-17 22:02:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-06-17 22:03:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know.
2014-06-17 22:03:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We've hit 5 times in 24 hours twice 
2014-06-17 22:03:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha

2014-06-17 22:03:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Damn, really?
2014-06-17 22:04:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You fall asleep immediately after 1/3 of them, so maybe you don't remember them all? 
2014-06-17 22:04:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-06-17 22:05:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I mean if I think about it, 3 times a day makes sense.
2014-06-17 22:05:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If only because I can't really imagine spending 6 hours with you and not having sex.
2014-06-17 22:12:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sooo soon

2014-06-17 22:29:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-06-17 22:31:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]should we take a leisurely scenic drive before we head back to my place?
2014-06-17 22:33:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol

2014-06-17 22:46:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna get to sleep. I can't believe I actually get to see you tomorrow!
2014-06-17 22:48:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you. Sweet dreams, beautiful.
2014-06-17 22:51:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you! I'll probably be packing most of the night. Mwah!
2014-06-18 06:55:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]12 hours!
2014-06-18 07:15:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm so excited! Definitely got a little bit of that nervous energy.
2014-06-18 09:16:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tingly butterflies 
2014-06-18 09:19:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-06-18 12:39:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My flight is delayed 35 minutes 
2014-06-18 12:39:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Grrr
2014-06-18 12:44:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's storming here, I guess that's why
2014-06-18 12:44:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So arrival time is now 7:50
2014-06-18 12:45:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK :(
2014-06-18 12:46:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha awww
2014-06-18 12:47:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's another 30 minutes
2014-06-18 12:48:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh! I see how it is.
2014-06-18 12:48:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I actually really needed it cause I was just on the phone with an oyster guy for 1.5 hrs and now I'm running around again like a chicken with it's head cut off
2014-06-18 12:49:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just rationalizing the situation. Cause obviously I'm going out oft mind with anticipation 
2014-06-18 12:51:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well at least you can use the time.
2014-06-18 12:51:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I'll stay at work any longer.
2014-06-18 12:52:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think ten hours is plenty.
2014-06-18 12:52:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]More like 10.5 actually if I stay until 7. I got in at 8:30 today.
2014-06-18 12:54:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh you should definitely go home and chill. That's a long work day
2014-06-18 12:56:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I actually need to pick up some toilet paper so I'll probably do that haha
2014-06-18 13:00:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Umm yes please haha
2014-06-18 13:13:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now it's delayed an hour....now I am upset
2014-06-18 13:14:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😭
2014-06-18 13:15:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No more delays please
2014-06-18 14:27:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Current ETA is 9:30 :(((
2014-06-18 14:36:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh no
2014-06-18 14:36:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I looked to see if I could take a different flight, but no luck
2014-06-18 14:36:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The plane must be delayed somewhere else
2014-06-18 14:38:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah it looks like it's delayed coming out of Orlando.
2014-06-18 14:38:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm bummed
2014-06-18 14:39:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, me too
2014-06-18 14:39:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least you don't have to pick me up chickfila anymore?
2014-06-18 14:40:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like doing things for you, though :(
2014-06-18 14:42:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think I should still get there before 4:30? In case they find another plane?
2014-06-18 14:44:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know how that works. My suspicion is that it wouldn't matter.
2014-06-18 14:55:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh the Orlando flight is after Raleigh. I don't know what the deal is.
2014-06-18 15:57:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Heading to the airport now
2014-06-18 15:57:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I couldn't wait 
2014-06-18 16:00:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well that's kinda cute.
2014-06-18 16:19:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And even with the delay, I'll see you in almost 4 hours!
2014-06-18 16:20:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You better!
2014-06-18 16:21:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should take a nap
2014-06-18 16:21:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We might be up a little past your bed time tonight ;)
2014-06-18 16:22:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yesss
2014-06-18 16:23:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you working a little late today still?
2014-06-18 16:23:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, man. Four hours is way too long now that you've put that in my head.
2014-06-18 16:23:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](Unintentional double entendre)
2014-06-18 16:23:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I'm gonna stay until 6:30.
2014-06-18 16:34:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck
2014-06-18 16:34:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is fucking ridiculous 
2014-06-18 16:35:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nooooo
2014-06-18 16:35:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm legitimately sad.
2014-06-18 16:35:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too
2014-06-18 16:35:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I'm about to cry
2014-06-18 16:36:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:(
2014-06-18 16:40:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you. Is there anything you can do to keep yourself entertained?
2014-06-18 16:44:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you too
2014-06-18 16:46:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm in line to see of they have another option
2014-06-18 16:47:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. Good luck.
2014-06-18 16:48:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I have a funny story about the Tevas
2014-06-18 16:49:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you just letting me know for later? Haha
2014-06-18 16:50:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I think the comedic ting would be best spoken
2014-06-18 16:50:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*timing
2014-06-18 16:50:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll call you when you get off
2014-06-18 16:50:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK 😘
2014-06-18 16:54:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The shitty thing is if I was here on time I might've been able to take the 4:30p connecting flight and gotten in at 9:30
2014-06-18 16:56:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There's no way you would've known that at the time, though.
2014-06-18 16:56:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That getting in at 9:30 would be an improvement.
2014-06-18 17:07:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I know
2014-06-18 17:07:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe they'll fly really fast to make up for it
2014-06-18 17:08:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'd be nice.
2014-06-18 17:08:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just want to see the love of my life... is that too much to ask?!
2014-06-18 17:09:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it easier to fly east or west?
2014-06-18 17:10:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Faster to fly east.
2014-06-18 17:10:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love of your life? I like the sound of that
2014-06-18 17:10:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!
2014-06-18 17:11:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-06-18 17:30:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The fucking World Cup is making it extra hard to find a bar to chill at
2014-06-18 17:31:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol fuck ⚽.
2014-06-18 17:31:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And people who use chairs as bag holders deserve to die
2014-06-18 17:32:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha. Ask them to move it.
2014-06-18 17:34:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not sure how'd that go over
2014-06-18 17:36:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some of these bags look like they cost more than I make a month
2014-06-18 17:36:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha just be nice about it. People need to know when they're being ridiculous.
2014-06-18 17:56:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you want to talk for a bit?
2014-06-18 17:57:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah! Gimme a second to finish up my food
2014-06-18 17:59:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok
2014-06-18 18:09:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was delayed again
2014-06-18 18:09:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm waiting to talk to someone 
2014-06-18 18:09:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also Trevor price is on my flight
2014-06-18 18:10:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have a feeling you won't be making it here tonight

2014-06-18 19:17:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm mostly sad cause it's true 
2014-06-18 19:18:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you go in a little late tomorrow?
2014-06-18 19:18:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, if that's what you want    😃

2014-06-18 19:22:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was planning on doing 9 to 3
2014-06-18 19:22:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tomorrow and Fri
2014-06-18 19:22:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhh

2014-06-18 19:23:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well we can play it by ear, right? Or do you have to let them know when you're coming in?
2014-06-18 19:23:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I know how you are in the morning    😉 
2014-06-18 19:23:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no I don't have to let them no
2014-06-18 19:23:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]know

2014-06-18 19:24:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I guess I know how you are in the afternoon ;)
2014-06-18 19:25:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess it's more we know how "we" are at all times of the day
2014-06-18 19:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much longerrrrrrrrr
2014-06-18 19:26:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I should try to sleep

2014-06-18 19:28:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should definitely sleep
2014-06-18 19:29:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our plane hasn't left Detroit yet
2014-06-18 19:30:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If it hasn't left by 8p I'm gonna try to get on the last one which gets in at 1:30p
2014-06-18 19:31:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the flight from Detroit is really short
2014-06-18 19:31:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, it's scheduled to get in at 9p
2014-06-18 19:31:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But the fact it still hasn't left isn't comforting 
2014-06-18 19:32:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is some bull shit
2014-06-18 19:38:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Um yes. I can't decide if it's SWA's fault or not
2014-06-18 19:39:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm getting close to blaming/hating them anyways 
2014-06-18 19:39:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-18 19:39:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are other flights not delayed?
2014-06-18 19:41:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for real, though.
2014-06-18 19:41:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm like legit bummed out
2014-06-18 19:43:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A lot if flights are delayed it seems
2014-06-18 19:43:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But all the previous Raleigh flights left with more than an hour delay
2014-06-18 19:45:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least your on a comfy bed
2014-06-18 19:45:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess
2014-06-18 19:45:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably shirtless
2014-06-18 19:45:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more of a reminder that you're not here, though    😞 
2014-06-18 19:46:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha not shirtless
2014-06-18 19:46:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you can think of me that way anyway    😉 
2014-06-18 19:50:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should take a nap, set an alarm for 12am and I'll text you my eta before I leave 
2014-06-18 19:51:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok.

2014-06-18 19:59:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Vanilla
2014-06-18 20:01:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you think you'll need ice cream or sex first?
2014-06-18 20:02:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Honey, if the universe is turning on you it's got a lot of extraneous casualties in this airport 
2014-06-18 20:03:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sex, obvs
2014-06-18 20:03:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With naked ice cream in bed
2014-06-18 20:04:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha sex while eating ice cream?
2014-06-18 20:04:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me behind you and a bowl in front of you?
2014-06-18 20:05:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too much of a good thing 
2014-06-18 20:05:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha

2014-06-18 20:21:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-06-18 20:21:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On a plane like 5 years ago
2014-06-18 21:21:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you watching it now?
2014-06-18 21:22:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I got sucked into tea and a speciation debate with Trevor
2014-06-18 21:33:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hope you're napping my love!
2014-06-18 21:37:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just took a shower. I am watching it now.
2014-06-18 21:40:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not looking too good
2014-06-18 21:40:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-06-18 21:41:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our plane still hasn't left Detroit 
2014-06-18 21:41:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mmmk
2014-06-18 21:41:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll see you tomorrow
2014-06-18 21:41:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sucks you had to sit at an airport all day
2014-06-18 21:41:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not giving up yet!
2014-06-18 21:41:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless you'd rather go to sleep instead of stay up 
2014-06-18 21:42:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll pick you up if you fly in tonight
2014-06-18 21:43:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'd rather sleep in the airport than go home and sleep alone
2014-06-18 21:43:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's pretty hardcore
2014-06-18 21:45:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is kinda shitty
2014-06-18 21:46:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I waited for you until 3a, now you get to do the same
2014-06-18 21:47:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ha I guess so
2014-06-18 21:47:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll get there tonight, one way or another 
2014-06-18 21:48:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it's really up to you at this point
2014-06-18 21:48:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll hop on the red eye greyhound
2014-06-18 21:48:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll take a train 
2014-06-18 21:48:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'd be better off taking a morning flight
2014-06-18 21:49:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Apparently the plane is no longer being held on the ground because of weather! It's air traffic hold
2014-06-18 21:49:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So it'll definitely go out
2014-06-18 21:50:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well hopefully I'll be seeing you in the wee hours of the morning then
2014-06-18 21:54:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Give me a call when you land I suppose
2014-06-18 21:54:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah get some sleep. It won't be until at least 1:30a. I'll text before and call when I land.

2014-06-18 21:55:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too

2014-06-18 22:21:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's fine with headphones.
2014-06-18 22:21:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I ain't got those for the phone 
2014-06-18 22:22:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hooray!
2014-06-18 22:22:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You don't bring headphones with you when you fly?
2014-06-18 22:36:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They don't fit my phone
2014-06-18 22:37:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do they fit in?
2014-06-18 22:38:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My iPad
2014-06-18 22:38:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Computer
2014-06-18 22:38:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My ears
2014-06-18 22:38:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh. Like the case makes them not fit?
2014-06-18 22:45:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly 
2014-06-18 22:46:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I'm getting really sleepy
2014-06-18 22:46:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And loopy
2014-06-18 22:46:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got up at 6a
2014-06-18 23:10:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On the plane! 2:00a but I'll call when I land 
2014-06-19 08:50:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My milk is the 2% and my eggs are the ones that aren't in the door of the fridge.
2014-06-19 10:54:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's the first time I've slept in until noon in a longgg time 
2014-06-19 10:59:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you feel happy/relaxed/refreshed?
2014-06-19 11:01:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All of those things
2014-06-19 11:01:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I miss you already!
2014-06-19 11:04:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you too. Only four more hours!
2014-06-19 11:05:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha the last time one of us said that we were terribly mistaken 
2014-06-19 11:10:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hopefully fewer variables this time.
2014-06-19 11:14:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where's the laundry?
2014-06-19 11:15:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In the basement where Alexandre stays. If the door is open you can just go down. I can give you his number to text him if it's not.
2014-06-19 11:16:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The door is the first on your left when waking to the front of the house.
2014-06-19 11:18:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ehhh I'll wait until you're here
2014-06-19 11:19:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are some of these tortillas yours?
2014-06-19 11:19:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In the pantry.
2014-06-19 11:19:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The ones on the same level as the Lucky Charms.
2014-06-19 11:20:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The shredded cheese is in the door by some jam.
2014-06-19 11:20:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I forget where the salsa is. Either on the same level as the tortillas or in the fridge. All this stuff is unopened so it should be obvious.
2014-06-19 11:22:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found it all. Thanks babe
2014-06-19 11:22:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘
2014-06-19 11:40:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would've taken a picture of the egg burrito, but I ate it too fast 
2014-06-19 11:42:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-06-19 11:42:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Looks yummy. I want some!
2014-06-19 11:44:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's for lunch today?
2014-06-19 11:44:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably hit up the cafeteria here in a bit. I actually haven't eaten there yet.
2014-06-19 11:48:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much! I'm so happy you're here.
2014-06-19 11:52:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If not this visit, then next one I'm gonna cook you dinner
2014-06-19 11:53:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They have a surprisingly wide assortment of pans and utensils 
2014-06-19 11:55:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sounds nice :)
2014-06-19 11:55:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And yeah they do. Someone cleaned the kitchen a bit too.
2014-06-19 11:55:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm betting it was Alexandre's girlfriend.
2014-06-19 11:56:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]She seems like the type of person who would do that for a stranger's girlfriend haha.
2014-06-19 11:57:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I respect that. 
2014-06-19 12:22:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They make a decent sandwich!
2014-06-19 12:22:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Red Hat that is.
2014-06-19 12:51:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it free?
2014-06-19 12:52:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause that'd be pretty cool.
2014-06-19 12:52:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am straight up unable to do work today
2014-06-19 12:52:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha no it's not. And that's fine. I think you could use a solid chill day!
2014-06-19 12:53:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm watching the World Cup right now haha.
2014-06-19 12:53:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you gotten any work done?
2014-06-19 12:56:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I've been pretty productive actually.
2014-06-19 12:57:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Only two more hours! I could get used to this six hour day thing.
2014-06-19 12:58:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And me at either end of it? :)
2014-06-19 12:59:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely.
2014-06-19 13:15:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you want for dinner? Or what kind if food do you definitely don't want?
2014-06-19 13:17:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm down with whatever. Pick whatever catches your eye.
2014-06-19 13:58:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might be delayed a bit, lol.
2014-06-19 13:58:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There's a beer social at 4 I might go to for a bit. #MakeThoseConnections
2014-06-19 13:59:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Means I get out earlier tomorrow, though!
2014-06-19 14:09:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No problem! I'm doing so e recreational reading and having a lovely afternoon
2014-06-19 14:10:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you have pants on?
2014-06-19 14:10:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hell no
2014-06-19 14:10:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I am wearing one of your shirts

2014-06-20 10:22:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Foursquare suggests buku, Beasley's, and The Oxford. But I don't know how late any of them do brunch.
2014-06-20 10:22:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've only been here a month haha.

2014-06-22 17:56:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No thanks. I was doing dishes.
2014-06-23 12:46:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw :(
2014-06-23 12:50:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:((
2014-06-23 12:51:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Getting here ~3pm still work? I'm getting close to done, even got to talk on the phone to Cathy
2014-06-23 12:52:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's good. Do you want me getting there at 3 or leaving at 3?
2014-06-23 12:52:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess get here at 3? Unless you need to finish up some work 
2014-06-23 12:52:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah, that works.
2014-06-23 18:17:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!!!! 
2014-06-23 18:18:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In case you've forgotten already
2014-06-23 18:18:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did! Thanks for reminding me.
2014-06-23 18:18:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I knew it
2014-06-23 18:18:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]get through security?
2014-06-23 18:19:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah in zero time. We could've gotten in at least one more bed romp
2014-06-23 18:19:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-23 18:19:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd probably be shooting blanks if we tried.
2014-06-23 18:19:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess my plan to plant a bunch of drugs on you so you couldn't leave didn't work    😕 
2014-06-23 18:20:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But now I have lots of drugs!
2014-06-23 18:20:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's the spirit
2014-06-23 18:20:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or is this plan B to get the NSA to ground me?
2014-06-23 18:21:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're tricky
2014-06-23 18:21:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😉 
2014-06-23 18:21:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To check 3 bags on American costs $210
2014-06-23 18:22:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What the actual fuck
2014-06-23 18:22:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]holy shit
2014-06-23 18:22:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sucks I'm sorry    😞 
2014-06-23 18:22:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh no I only checked one
2014-06-23 18:22:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For $25
2014-06-23 18:22:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-06-23 18:22:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just thought it was utterly ridiculous
2014-06-23 18:23:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was wondering why you checked all three
2014-06-23 18:23:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah that's pretty crazy
2014-06-23 18:23:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess it makes sense
2014-06-23 18:23:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Southwest you can check 3 for $75
2014-06-23 18:23:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, one more reason for you to love them
2014-06-23 18:24:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also American always does a ton of free gate checks every time I fly with them. It just seems inconvenient 
2014-06-23 18:25:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's a free gate check
2014-06-23 18:25:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where the flight is full so not everyone's carryons will fit in the overhead bins
2014-06-23 18:25:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So people have to check their bag at the gate 
2014-06-23 18:26:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, yeah
2014-06-23 18:29:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you excited to see your brother?
2014-06-23 18:30:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you just saw him, haha
2014-06-23 18:30:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I won't see him at all, he left for his music fest today 
2014-06-23 18:31:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, wait where are you flying to?
2014-06-23 18:31:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Los Angeles 
2014-06-23 18:31:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely send me your schedule when you get the chance
2014-06-23 18:31:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But he's flying out of LA today
2014-06-23 18:31:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-06-23 18:31:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you're staying at his place or something?

2014-06-23 21:48:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awww she loves her chillun
2014-06-23 21:48:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This 3 hour time difference is gonna wreck me I think
2014-06-23 21:48:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt
2014-06-23 21:49:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you gotta stay up when you get there!

2014-06-23 21:51:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Plus maybe it'll help me wake up earlier
2014-06-23 21:51:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does your field work require early mornings?
2014-06-23 21:54:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have no idea haha. I need to look at the tides, but for this one in WA I'm going to I'll be working with an oyster ecologist so she'll be making the daily schedule I guess. 
2014-06-23 21:54:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-06-23 22:04:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're gonna have to keep our hands off each other for a long time on our Missoula flights 
2014-06-23 22:05:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I think we do a pretty good job of handling ourselves in public
2014-06-23 22:06:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I make sure I only grab your butt  occasionally  in public.
2014-06-23 22:06:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I misspelled occasionally the first time I wrote it again.
2014-06-23 22:08:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Facebook is always telling me to ask you for your Relationship Status
2014-06-23 22:09:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha is that a not-so-subtle way of trying to make this FBO?
2014-06-23 22:09:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no
2014-06-23 22:09:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just thought it was funny.
2014-06-23 22:09:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah Facebook asks me that too
2014-06-23 22:10:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've almost clicked it a couple times just to be silly
2014-06-23 22:10:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I asked you    😉 
2014-06-23 22:23:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]D'aww we're so compatible 
2014-06-23 22:24:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Getting on 3 hour plane #dos

2014-06-23 22:31:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uber isn't legal in Houston (or wasn't the last time I checked) because of old taxi laws
2014-06-23 22:31:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that shit is so backwards
2014-06-23 22:32:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Agreed
2014-06-23 22:32:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did I tell you I took left for the 1st time to midway on the way to Raleigh?
2014-06-23 22:32:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*lyft
2014-06-23 22:32:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, you mentioned it. I forget what you had to say about it, though.
2014-06-23 22:34:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was great. Only $17, my driver was this really funny really friendly Chinese guy who did stats for a company and asked me all about my oyster project and knew a surprisingly lot about PopGen 
2014-06-23 22:34:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no shit
2014-06-23 22:34:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even know what lyft is really
2014-06-23 22:34:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll have to look it up
2014-06-23 22:34:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He said he liked airport rides because Costco is near there so he gets a paid ride to costco 
2014-06-23 22:35:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah you should. I'm even half debating doing it a little bit in the fall after talking to this guy about it
2014-06-23 22:35:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no kidding
2014-06-23 22:36:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do you hear about all this stuff?
2014-06-23 22:36:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm not really in a cab city
2014-06-23 22:37:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even though I don't reddit, I'm still a little in touch with some things in my generation
2014-06-23 22:37:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I also have a couple friends who are lyft drivers
2014-06-23 22:37:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I dig
2014-06-23 22:38:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you!!!
2014-06-23 22:38:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss youuuu
2014-06-23 22:38:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why aren't you in my bed so I can fall asleep already?
2014-06-23 22:39:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aw I bet you'll crash plenty hard once we stop texting 
2014-06-23 22:39:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'm reasonably tired so I hope that's the case
2014-06-23 22:45:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Two sad snaps in a day :(
2014-06-23 22:45:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That one was supposed to be a little more "bittersweet"
2014-06-23 22:46:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah?
2014-06-23 22:46:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because I am excited/nervous for fieldwork but still sad to be leaving you  
2014-06-23 22:46:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Butttt I'm also be seeing you in 24 short days, so not too sad 
2014-06-23 22:47:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw. Yeah I'm excited for you.
2014-06-23 22:47:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're gonna learn a bunch and get to see some cool shit.
2014-06-23 22:48:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I like how you're all onboard with this visit now after trying to talk me out of it ;)
2014-06-23 22:49:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Welllll I got over feeling guilty about you paying so much money when it's obviously something I really want too
2014-06-23 22:50:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I also was underestimating a little how sad it'd feel to leave you
2014-06-23 22:51:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh yeah? I'm kinda surprised at that.
2014-06-23 22:52:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, usually I'm a pretty good compartmentalizer about that kind of stuff
2014-06-23 22:53:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess you're not that easy to compartmentalize :)
2014-06-23 22:53:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I don't spend much time with this emotionally reserved Katie you speak of.
2014-06-23 22:57:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's cause I like ya so much haha
2014-06-23 22:58:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-06-23 22:59:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm gonna try to fall asleep.

2014-06-24 13:34:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I tried looking for some for you and there's just too much, it's overwhelming. I usually wait until the end of the year lists come out and just use those. I'll try harder to find something tonight and we can listen to it "together".

2014-06-24 19:18:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just didn't want to sound too sassy
2014-06-24 19:18:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause obviously I'm driving haha
2014-06-24 19:19:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh so not masturbating while driving?
2014-06-24 19:20:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This car doesn't quiteee vibrate enough 
2014-06-24 19:22:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha probably a good thing.

2014-06-25 01:04:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://cphpost.dk/news/the-danish-languages-irritable-vowel-syndrome.129.html
2014-06-25 13:09:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey honey 
2014-06-25 13:14:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey, sugar. How are you doing?
2014-06-25 13:27:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty good. Turns out I don't have to be in Washington until 5p so I'm not rushing as much
2014-06-25 13:28:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. How far away are you?
2014-06-25 13:38:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]About 4 hours. Getting Daniels oil changed because apparently it's been 8000 miles
2014-06-25 13:41:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah you mentioned that last night. I heard 7,500 miles is the actual time for an oil change.
2014-06-25 13:42:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]3,000 is just what industry people say.
2014-06-25 13:42:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh ok, well that'd not too bad. I think LA dust and city driving don't help though
2014-06-25 13:42:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe.
2014-06-25 13:59:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's work?
2014-06-25 14:00:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not bad. Getting shit done. Doing a lot of R today.
2014-06-25 14:00:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was pretty groggy this morning, but I made it in at 9.
2014-06-25 14:00:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's my man 
2014-06-25 14:02:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The executive for our Executive Lunch + Learn was in Raleigh today.
2014-06-25 14:03:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He makes $418,750 in salary, $278,800 in bonuses, and $2,295,926 in bonuses.
2014-06-25 14:04:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So that's the first time I've ever knowingly been in the room with a millionaire.
2014-06-25 14:07:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Damn
2014-06-25 15:11:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One day we should go vineyard hopping and stay at cute b&b 
2014-06-25 15:14:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're so effing adorable.
2014-06-25 15:21:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)

2014-06-25 16:15:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Of things for us to do?
2014-06-25 16:32:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-06-25 16:33:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Speaking of which you never found me an album. Someone must've been distracting you last night 
2014-06-25 16:33:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Love it.
2014-06-25 16:33:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah. I'll do that tonight.
2014-06-25 16:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You should make a Google Spreadsheet or I will that we can both edit.
2014-06-25 16:36:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha you're the google pro, make it and I'll fill it out :)
2014-06-25 16:59:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, I sort of got carried away and put almost all epic adventures
2014-06-25 17:03:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yay I can't wait to see it!
2014-06-25 17:03:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm down for a life full of epic adventures with you

2014-06-25 17:53:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'm hardcore
2014-06-25 17:53:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was imagining a slightly different organizational scheme 
2014-06-25 17:53:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-06-25 17:54:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And so modest
2014-06-25 17:54:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]feel free to do whatever you want to it
2014-06-25 17:54:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was just a template
2014-06-25 18:48:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made it!
2014-06-25 18:50:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This place is like the quintessential field station house, mix match furniture, bookshelves full of cookbooks and guidebooks, the garage has microscopes and sample tubes
2014-06-25 19:02:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like a good place to be :)
2014-06-25 21:17:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really want to listen to any of those albums I sent you besides the Jack White one, haha

2014-06-25 22:32:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The whole playlist? That's quite an endeavor 
2014-06-25 22:37:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Getting up at 4a tomorrow! So I'm going to sleep now. Love you my dear

2014-06-26 14:42:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely had fun, but I was also cold and wet and covered in mud from 5:30a-11:30a
2014-06-26 15:36:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oooh I like it when you talk dirty ;)

2014-06-26 22:01:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I cut my right thumb up, so I hope you know I'm putting myself through excruciating pain just to text you :)
2014-06-26 22:02:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what happened?
2014-06-26 22:03:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Using my Swiss Army knife as an oyster knife
2014-06-26 22:03:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dissected and evaluated 25 oysters today!
2014-06-26 22:03:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-06-26 22:03:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what does evaluated mean
2014-06-26 22:04:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Took measurements, determined reproductive stage, looked at brooding larvae under microscope 
2014-06-26 22:04:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ate the leftovers lol
2014-06-26 22:05:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-06-26 22:05:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you doing tomorrow
2014-06-26 22:06:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going out by myself to collect some more, and then making deep water oyster settlement things 
2014-06-26 22:06:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cinderblock tied up with really thick line and a buoy
2014-06-26 22:07:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they just stick themselves to it
2014-06-26 22:07:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I guess baby oysters love concrete 
2014-06-26 22:07:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I get to use a big scary knife and Melt the end of the rope
2014-06-26 22:08:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Something I'm way more excited about than I should be
2014-06-26 22:08:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're not gonna have any fingers next time I see you
2014-06-26 22:09:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just had a disturbingly funny image of me giving you a blow job with no fingers
2014-06-26 22:09:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, I was gonna make a joke about how maybe that'll mean you have to use your mouth more
2014-06-26 22:10:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't think I go down on you enough?
2014-06-26 22:10:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no, that's why I didn't make the joke
2014-06-26 22:10:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-06-26 22:10:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've used your mouth more than your hands at this point I'd say
2014-06-26 22:11:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do I not use my hands enough for you??
2014-06-26 22:11:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-06-26 22:12:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just kidding with you
2014-06-26 22:12:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess we don't ever have a need for it
2014-06-26 22:13:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why bother with hands when I've got warm wet places to put my penis
2014-06-26 22:13:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-26 22:13:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually do like when you use your hands, though
2014-06-26 22:13:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like everything you do
2014-06-26 22:13:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so yeah
2014-06-26 22:14:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They have a removable shower head at the house I'm staying in
2014-06-26 22:14:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, you gonna take advantage of that?
2014-06-26 22:15:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously. Best to use it now while I still have last week fresh in my mind ;)
2014-06-26 22:15:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds good
2014-06-26 22:16:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What'd you do at work today?
2014-06-26 22:17:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]added nodes to my Bayesian network
2014-06-26 22:17:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]changed to a different algorithm in the R package I've been using to learn the network
2014-06-26 22:17:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that seems to work better
2014-06-26 22:17:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]built a little Bayesian network pipeline
2014-06-26 22:17:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from data to inference
2014-06-26 22:18:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that other people could probably adapt to their needs pretty easily
2014-06-26 22:18:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least that was the goal
2014-06-26 22:18:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we had an intern volunteer thing
2014-06-26 22:18:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a non-profit called Kramden Institute

2014-06-26 22:26:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Summer is a good time to push through those slow first episodes to get to the better ones 
2014-06-26 22:27:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you gave plenty if time to catch up and watch it with me next year

2014-06-27 12:25:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was, I think this is evidence for why we should sleep together as much as possibly 
2014-06-27 12:47:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha bad dreams are the only reason I'm sure.

2014-06-29 16:18:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why don't chickens have boob?

2014-06-29 16:59:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because they aren't mammals 
2014-06-29 16:59:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope
2014-06-29 16:59:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because roosters don't have hands

2014-06-29 18:27:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did a lot of this today

2014-06-29 20:03:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm feeling more and more justified with that plane ticket purchase every day
2014-06-29 21:05:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah. I knew about those things. Didn't realize they were called reefs.
2014-06-29 21:07:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you think HBO demands each episode of GOT have s sex scene?
2014-06-29 21:12:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a little odd how you prefer texting over talking on the phone 
2014-06-29 21:13:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We could've kept talking on the phone!
2014-06-29 21:13:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I know you warned me about not liking to talk on the phone
2014-06-29 21:13:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah but it felt like you were distracted or something 
2014-06-29 21:13:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah. I'm sorry.
2014-06-29 21:20:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Alright, well have a nice drive and have fun doing oystery things.
2014-06-29 21:46:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I dunno why I'm grumpy about talking to you today. I guess it's a distance thing 
2014-06-29 21:46:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My service is patchy though, so I'll talk to you tomorrow. Love you
2014-06-29 21:58:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you think we should lower our expectations as far as communicating goes while you're on the West Coast?
2014-06-29 22:02:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess
2014-06-29 22:04:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just worried if we don't talk everyday you'll get too frustrated or think it's not gonna work  
2014-06-29 22:04:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It just seems like our schedules combined with the three hour time difference makes things difficult
2014-06-29 22:05:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's why I'm saying lower our expectations
2014-06-29 22:05:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you don't have to get stressed out about trying to make sure you call me or anything
2014-06-29 22:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I don't have any expectation of it happening
2014-06-29 22:05:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so there's no tension there
2014-06-29 22:08:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess 
2014-06-29 22:08:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean or not
2014-06-29 22:08:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm asking you what you think
2014-06-29 22:15:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I was making too big a deal about you doing stuff on the computer during one of the few times we can talk
2014-06-29 22:16:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that now we're having a texting conversation while I'm driving 
2014-06-29 22:16:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok, we can talk about it later
2014-06-30 00:25:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Made it to Cathy's and they have wifi but absolutely no service haha
2014-06-30 00:27:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you, sorry for being a little cranky today. Hope your throat feels better and you have sweet dreams!
2014-06-30 07:23:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too, my sexy scientist ;)
2014-06-30 08:17:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not quite as good as a pic of us, but it'll do. https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-P_RXYOJaKU4/U7FjYINsoXI/AAAAAAAAU_w/IsQvOg3npts/s0/2014-06-30
2014-06-30 08:18:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What is it?
2014-06-30 08:19:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Your postcard.
2014-06-30 08:19:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I see it now
2014-06-30 08:19:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-06-30 16:09:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Come take care of meeeee
2014-06-30 16:11:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you a sick honey?
2014-06-30 16:12:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah    😞 
2014-06-30 16:13:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish I was there too
2014-06-30 16:13:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fever?
2014-06-30 16:13:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think so. My throat is killing me and I just feel all around poopy.
2014-06-30 16:14:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should go to the doctor, get some meds and kill it now 
2014-06-30 16:14:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might be the flu...
2014-06-30 16:14:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dat lack of health insurance, tho
2014-06-30 16:14:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oooooo
2014-06-30 16:14:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Poor baby
2014-06-30 16:15:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't die before I get to see you again!
2014-06-30 16:15:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-30 16:15:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]same to you!
2014-06-30 16:15:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure I'll pull through
2014-06-30 16:17:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My near death experiences were at a minimum today
2014-06-30 16:17:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just talked to Cathy for a couple of hours and walked around the rocky intertidal for a few more
2014-06-30 16:18:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I did slip and get a giant bruise on my ass
2014-06-30 16:18:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man. Wish I could kiss it to make it better.
2014-06-30 16:18:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was talking to Cathy?
2014-06-30 16:19:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure that's your only motive ;)
2014-06-30 16:20:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was good! I'm pretty happy she's going to be my advisor, I think we're a good match. 
2014-06-30 16:20:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's definitely a good sign I'd say
2014-06-30 16:22:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna go to the beach for a bit though and get to read recreationally 
2014-06-30 16:22:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hope you feel better! Get lots of sleep 
2014-06-30 16:22:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Drink lots of water 
2014-06-30 16:22:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And vitamin C things
2014-06-30 16:22:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]thanks. Enjoy your time at the beach!
2014-06-30 18:42:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Took a nap in my 3/4 sleeve shirt and definitely have a funky tan line now
2014-06-30 19:23:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice.
2014-06-30 19:28:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How is my man doin'?
2014-06-30 19:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just woke up from a three hour nap.
2014-06-30 19:32:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You might as well have stayed asleep! Do you think you're gonna make it to work tomorrow?
2014-06-30 19:33:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah. Pretty good evidence I'm actually sick I'd say. I might work from home, depending on my state.
2014-06-30 19:33:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How's my beautiful biologist doing?
2014-06-30 19:33:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ooo alliteration 
2014-06-30 19:33:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's the word for a person who studies oysters?
2014-06-30 19:34:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah, I used sexy scientist this morning
2014-06-30 19:34:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ostracologist 
2014-06-30 19:35:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice.
2014-06-30 19:36:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good lunch coming up with an adoring alliteration for that haha
2014-06-30 19:36:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm good, trying to figure out what to do for the 4th
2014-06-30 19:38:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I'm having trouble coming up with an o word. Is your friend not in Seattle?
2014-06-30 19:49:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]magnificient malacologist
2014-06-30 19:52:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're so clever :)
2014-06-30 19:52:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Her family is staying with her those days, and her family is super not fun
2014-06-30 19:52:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But! 
2014-06-30 19:53:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to stay with Amy at Friday harbor for a few days and she's gonna show me around and take me to some 4th if July parties so it actually works out perfectly
2014-06-30 19:54:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh nice
2014-06-30 19:59:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I'm actually pretty surprised how well things have generally been working out so far- considering how little was actually planned before I got here 
2014-06-30 20:01:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-06-30 20:02:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I should say pleasantly surprised. 
2014-06-30 20:05:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also I'm gonna get to meet up with my friend Devin from semester at sea in Seattle for a night. She's arguably one of my favorite people I've ever met and will definitely be the doula for all of my babies
2014-06-30 20:06:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's cool
2014-06-30 20:06:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I've never experienced the word "doula" before
2014-06-30 20:09:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like a hippy midwife
2014-06-30 20:09:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-06-30 20:25:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you have planned for the rest of the evening?
2014-06-30 21:21:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just had dinner with the Wooton-Pfisters 
2014-06-30 21:21:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Grilled salmon-yummy
2014-06-30 21:46:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gonna have another really busy day tomorrow
2014-06-30 21:47:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's cool. What are you gonna be doing?
2014-06-30 21:54:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha these conversations are so frustrating for me
2014-06-30 21:55:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jeez 6 min and you get antsy?
2014-06-30 21:55:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'd think you'd be happy with at least some interaction over none :/
2014-06-30 21:56:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'd rather just not talk until we're both free and then have an actual conversation
2014-06-30 21:56:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-06-30 21:59:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess just message me next time you're free and we can video or something?
2014-06-30 22:02:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you want I can send little updates, and then let you know when I'm free for an undivided conversation. That might not be for a while, but you're right I'm over this texting drama 
2014-06-30 22:03:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not really expecting to talk to you until you visit at this point
2014-06-30 22:04:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm hoping this is sick Michael talking
2014-06-30 22:05:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not trying to be mean or anything
2014-06-30 22:05:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just looking at your schedule and the way things have been thus far
2014-06-30 22:05:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't have high expectations
2014-06-30 22:05:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm going to be travelling both weekends
2014-06-30 22:09:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'd rather communicate as much as we can, even if it's piecemeal, than not talk to you at all for 2.5 weeks. But if that's not what you want than ok
2014-06-30 22:12:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We can keep things as they've been then, if you prefer it.
2014-06-30 22:12:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the "drama" you're referring to is last night and my saying these convos are frustrating?
2014-06-30 22:13:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah maybe drama was a bit too dramatic 
2014-06-30 22:19:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But clearly something needs to change in how we approach this. Maybe hangouts should not be used for conversations? Just little pictures and updates or whatever. I definitely don't want to use it to have discussions like these again, I'd rather wait to talk about issues on the phone or video or person. And it seems like you get frustrated when I start a casual conversation and can't keep up, so I won't do that anymore. 
2014-06-30 22:20:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that works. I guess that's what I was essentially proposing I thought
2014-06-30 22:20:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When did you propose that?
2014-06-30 22:21:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]23 mins ago
2014-06-30 22:21:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"I think I'd rather just not talk until we're both free and then have an actual conversation"
2014-06-30 22:21:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-06-30 22:22:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, talk to you later
2014-06-30 22:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight! Have fun in the field.
2014-06-30 22:22:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks
2014-06-30 22:23:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much and I miss you a lot
2014-06-30 22:23:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry this isn't going super smoothly
2014-06-30 22:24:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess that's what we signed up for 
2014-06-30 22:29:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah. I'm definitely not cut out for this stuff.
2014-06-30 22:30:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That bodes well for the next 10+ months
2014-06-30 22:30:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm assuming we'll be able to talk a little more often during the school year
2014-06-30 22:32:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've been getting a lot of bad vibes from you the past couple ofdays
2014-06-30 22:35:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Every time you say things like "I'm not cut out for this" and get frustrated at communication issues it makes it feel like this isn't going to work
2014-06-30 22:35:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that scares me and upsets me
2014-06-30 22:36:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'll try to stop saying those things. What do you want from me as far as communication?
2014-06-30 22:36:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And we're gonna work.
2014-06-30 22:36:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I promise
2014-06-30 22:37:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You are seriously the most amazing person I've ever met
2014-06-30 22:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you make me ridiculously happy
2014-06-30 22:38:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm willing to put up with this long distance stuff because those sporadic occasions where we're together are perfect
2014-06-30 22:39:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I know being with you for the long run is worth some (let's be honest here) minor frustrations in the present
2014-06-30 22:39:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Honest about them being minor, or honest about there being frustrations?
2014-06-30 22:40:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]them being minor
2014-06-30 22:40:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you really don't have to be scared
2014-06-30 22:40:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad you care enough about our relationship to be afraid of losing it
2014-06-30 22:40:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you really shouldn't waste your time/energy
2014-06-30 22:41:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, maybe I just needed a little reminder
2014-06-30 22:41:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You've got me hook, line, and sinker
2014-06-30 22:42:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't imagine a scenario where I wouldn't want to be with you anymore
2014-06-30 22:42:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't either
2014-06-30 22:43:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-06-30 22:43:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should let me know how I can be a better communicator in our current situation, though
2014-06-30 22:43:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so we can mitigate some of these frustrations
2014-06-30 22:44:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I trying to be whiney or antagonistic when I said these convos were frustrating
2014-06-30 22:45:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*wasn't
2014-06-30 22:45:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was mostly just pointing out my silly reactions to things
2014-06-30 22:45:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which was why I prefaced it with the haha
2014-06-30 22:46:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Here's what I'd like, but I am open to negotiation so you don't get too frustrated: I like waking up to texts from you and coming back from the field to messages and snapchats and stuff like that. And you should already know I reply whenever I can, often not being as social as I could be so I can have a little interaction with you. Video/phone call may not happen a lot until I get to LA
2014-06-30 22:46:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I will take advantage whenever I can, and maybe when I call you on the phone we can both try to make the most of it 
2014-06-30 22:48:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And now that I'm mostly convinced you won't just throw up your hands and dump me, we can avoid these silly texting conversations 
2014-06-30 22:49:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And go back to saying "I love you" every other message :)
2014-06-30 22:49:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I like the sound of that    😃 
2014-06-30 22:49:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you  😘   
2014-06-30 22:50:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I can definitely handle those requests
2014-06-30 22:50:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-06-30 22:51:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you added anything to the list?
2014-06-30 22:51:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I added something the 28th I believe.
2014-06-30 22:51:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, why does Google make me have a separate app to look at Google Drive and to actually edit it?
2014-06-30 22:52:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that was a recent change
2014-06-30 22:52:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a lot of people aren't crazy about it
2014-06-30 22:52:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the separated out all of their Google Drive apps, basically
2014-06-30 22:52:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so Sheets and Docs and whatever else there is have separate apps
2014-06-30 22:52:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That makes zero sense
2014-06-30 22:52:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like how Microsoft Office is
2014-06-30 22:52:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know.
2014-06-30 22:52:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It kinda makes sense
2014-06-30 22:53:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you think of it as analogous to Office
2014-06-30 22:53:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But does office really make sense?
2014-06-30 22:53:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think a lof of people who use just one Google Drive service tend to use multiple
2014-06-30 22:53:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as separate apps?
2014-06-30 22:54:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think Excel and Word and PowerPoint should be bundled together?
2014-06-30 22:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-06-30 22:54:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you troll me so hard
2014-06-30 22:54:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-06-30 22:55:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Computers are not mobile devices
2014-06-30 22:55:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*handheld devices 
2014-06-30 22:56:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where it's easy to have a word doc and an excel sheet open next to each other
2014-06-30 22:57:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess what do you get out of all your spreadsheets and Docs being in the same app?
2014-06-30 22:57:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't need Drive installed basically.
2014-06-30 22:57:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you just want to use Spreadsheets
2014-06-30 22:58:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Does drive take up that much room? And you do need drive and spreadsheets cause you save your shit in drive
2014-06-30 22:58:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should be able to edit with the app used to view

2014-07-01 17:16:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, good    😀 
2014-07-01 18:41:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wanna do a little research favor for me?
2014-07-01 18:41:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-07-01 18:43:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm doing stuff near Shelton, WA and then need to camp somewhere between there and Anacortes tonight
2014-07-01 18:44:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pref not more than 1.5 hr from Shelton 
2014-07-01 18:44:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you look it see where is a nice/fun/safe spot?
2014-07-01 18:45:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-07-01 18:45:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't mind backtracking north a little on US101 either
2014-07-01 18:46:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok, so you don't really care if the place is on the way to Anacortes
2014-07-01 18:46:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz Olympic National Forest is right to the Northwest of you
2014-07-01 18:47:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and Mt. Ranier National Park is East
2014-07-01 18:47:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Mt. Ranier is like 2 hours, though
2014-07-01 18:48:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] I want to be less than a 3 hour drive from Anacortes tm
2014-07-01 18:48:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh I see
2014-07-01 18:48:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're like three hours from where you are
2014-07-01 18:49:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Seattle is basically half way
2014-07-01 18:49:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's not really a prime camping area
2014-07-01 18:49:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if you don't really care if it's scenic I'm sure there are spots around there
2014-07-01 18:50:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is there anything around Shelton? Or a good spot nearby on 101 in the forest?
2014-07-01 18:50:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Olympic National Forest is Northwest of you
2014-07-01 18:51:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm driving through it right now and only 20 min from my field spot
2014-07-01 18:51:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Olympic National Forest?
2014-07-01 18:51:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-07-01 18:52:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well there's like a million campgrounds there it looks like
2014-07-01 18:53:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes, I guess I wanted up see if there was a recommended one, or something off i5 before hitting Seattle 
2014-07-01 18:53:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I'm looking
2014-07-01 18:54:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you 
2014-07-01 18:54:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😍 😘  
2014-07-01 19:04:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All of the places in Olympic National Forest are about an hour away from the middle of Shleton
2014-07-01 19:04:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can look up Staricase
2014-07-01 19:04:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Staircase Campground
2014-07-01 19:04:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and see what you think about that as far as distance
2014-07-01 19:04:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if that's too far, you're probably better off staying at one that's on the way to Seattle
2014-07-01 19:06:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are also Brown Creek and Big Creek
2014-07-01 19:06:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they don't have have any reviews
2014-07-01 20:51:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to try potlatch state park or skomish
2014-07-01 20:51:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Skokomish
2014-07-01 20:51:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good
2014-07-01 20:52:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am pretty unhappy and frustrated right now
2014-07-01 20:52:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry, honey    😞 
2014-07-01 20:52:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you want to talk?
2014-07-01 20:52:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, but in like an hour?
2014-07-01 20:52:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless you'll be asleep
2014-07-01 20:52:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's cool
2014-07-01 20:52:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah
2014-07-02 00:34:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will my car battery die if I run the radio on it through the movies? 
2014-07-02 02:18:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The transformers movie was terrrrrible by the way. We would've definitely been doing some heavy petting the entire time if you were here 
2014-07-02 07:07:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm guessing your battery made it? It seems like it should, but I honestly don't know.
2014-07-02 07:09:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I'm definitely down with some heavy petting at the drive-in. Maybe some head in the backseat?
2014-07-02 07:19:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I've ever gotten "parked head" before haha
2014-07-02 14:15:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm curious, does this mean you've gotten road head?
2014-07-02 14:24:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And 22 jump street was pretty good, but getting home at 3a was a little rough 
2014-07-02 14:27:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Damn that's late.
2014-07-02 14:27:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And yes.
2014-07-02 14:31:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't realize we talked for an hour and a half last night.
2014-07-02 14:31:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Am I burning through your minutes?
2014-07-02 14:34:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah. I'm on Straight Talk now, and I was talking on the computer last night anyway.
2014-07-02 14:38:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How has your day been?
2014-07-02 14:59:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kinda relaxing. Did a little 1.5 mile hike from the campsite. At Walmart now
2014-07-02 14:59:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A terrifying place
2014-07-02 15:08:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah?
2014-07-02 15:09:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It had 20 different kinds of bubbles, but no boogie boards
2014-07-02 15:09:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wtf

2014-07-02 20:17:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. Traffic was that bad?
2014-07-02 20:18:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes, and I guess you had to be in line by 5:30 for the 8:30 ferry
2014-07-02 20:18:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Holy shit. That is a long wait.

2014-07-02 20:47:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh I guess you don't have unlimited data right?

2014-07-02 20:50:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hope I crash rom texting

2014-07-02 22:22:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I almost wish you could see me when I'm in "sprinting down a hill with at least 45 lbs of shit and covered in mud" mode. Though it might make you reconsider this relationship a little lol
2014-07-02 22:22:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I wish I could see it too... doubt it'd make me reconsider, though
2014-07-02 22:23:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably just make me love you more
2014-07-02 22:23:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you just carried all the stuff?
2014-07-02 22:25:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This stuff plus a 5 foot pole that's hidden

2014-07-02 22:26:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's so bright there!
2014-07-02 22:26:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how long is the ferry ride?
2014-07-02 22:26:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]An hour
2014-07-02 22:27:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. Some chill out time
2014-07-02 22:27:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you excited about taking a shower?
2014-07-02 22:28:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You have noooo idea
2014-07-02 22:29:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ewwwww
2014-07-02 22:29:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're gross
2014-07-02 22:29:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You already promised you'd kiss them all!
2014-07-02 22:29:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha fiiiiine
2014-07-02 22:29:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You might need a haircut 
2014-07-02 22:30:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-07-02 22:30:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how short?
2014-07-02 22:30:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I better at least get a picture of the booty bruise at some point.
2014-07-02 22:31:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How short is up to you
2014-07-02 22:31:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I can handle full responsibility for making your hair decisions 
2014-07-02 22:31:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well it's pretty risk-free
2014-07-02 22:31:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz it grows back quickly
2014-07-02 22:32:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had it completely buzzed only 2.5 months ago
2014-07-02 22:32:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess about 3 months
2014-07-02 22:33:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's true 
2014-07-02 22:33:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Honestly, you can do whatever with your hair and my opinion of it would change little. Except maybe shoulder length or bald 
2014-07-02 22:34:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The beard has a more direct impact on my life
2014-07-02 22:34:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause it's on my face
2014-07-02 22:34:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-07-02 22:34:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if there's a length you prefer I might as well cut it that long is all I'm saying
2014-07-02 22:35:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have no preference between it's current length and the buzz
2014-07-02 22:35:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha so I don't need a haircut?
2014-07-02 22:36:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might have an opinion of the uncut length 2 weeks from now
2014-07-02 22:36:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I might not
2014-07-02 22:36:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess we can experiment 
2014-07-02 22:36:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-07-02 22:37:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you cut my hair?
2014-07-02 22:37:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how'd you feel about the manscaping last time
2014-07-02 22:37:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now that's a lot of pressure
2014-07-02 22:38:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Manscaping was slightly noticeable, but didn't make a huge difference either way
2014-07-02 22:38:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As long as it's not too prickly
2014-07-02 22:38:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see
2014-07-02 22:39:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want beard burn on my chest and stomach haha
2014-07-02 22:39:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was it somewhat prickly then?
2014-07-02 22:40:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe just a tiny bit, but not too bad
2014-07-02 22:40:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok I guess I probably won't trim this time then
2014-07-02 22:40:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're talking about my pubes right
2014-07-02 22:43:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I guess I was thinking about like the area near your happy trail
2014-07-02 22:44:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-07-02 22:45:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get the sense that you don't really care haha
2014-07-02 22:46:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have never gone down there and been at all displeased with what I saw hahaha
2014-07-02 22:46:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As long as they aren't so long they get in the way or tickle my nose, I don't care :)
2014-07-02 22:47:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds good
2014-07-02 22:47:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm drifting in and out of service 
2014-07-02 22:48:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no worries
2014-07-02 22:48:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you ever been to WA?
2014-07-02 22:48:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope
2014-07-02 22:48:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oregon

2014-07-02 22:51:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-07-02 22:51:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why's that?
2014-07-02 22:51:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The San Juan islands are so great!
2014-07-02 22:51:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When we have a boat, we are totes going on little sunset cruises together
2014-07-02 22:51:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Here

2014-07-02 22:52:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like the rain forests up there
2014-07-02 22:53:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was originally thinking about trying to head up that way for grad school before my plans changed
2014-07-03 01:14:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I guess the fiber optics cables are cut here
2014-07-03 01:15:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So no cell service and this house I'm staying in only has wifi because the professors have their own dish
2014-07-03 01:19:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But everyone expects it to be fixed soon, and I'll be in this house tomorrow night so can message you then
2014-07-03 01:19:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you, and I've loved talking on the phone to you the past couple of days!
2014-07-03 20:27:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Great fireworks.

2014-07-03 21:32:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well if you've never had the chance to fulfill it I guess it's my duty to help you out
2014-07-03 21:33:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well not if you're gonna complain the whole time 
2014-07-03 21:33:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was it Spiderman or The Notebook that planted that seed?

2014-07-03 21:34:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think that'd make me more likely
2014-07-03 21:34:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]especially if I could be in a Spidey suit
2014-07-03 21:34:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's build up to that hahaha
2014-07-03 21:34:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok

2014-07-03 21:37:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the one girl is a Chinese PhD student
2014-07-03 21:37:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the guy is a 20 year old like stereotypical hacker whiz kid
2014-07-03 21:37:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the girl, Qian, brought her Chinese friend with her
2014-07-03 21:38:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they did karaoke while we were sitting in the car, lol

2014-07-03 21:57:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not saying you have to explain it
2014-07-03 21:57:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Honey, haven't we already talked about that?

2014-07-03 22:42:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so
2014-07-03 22:43:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't really like the idea of going radio silent for 3 days with you in a bad mood because of something I said 
2014-07-03 22:43:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you gonna be out of contact?
2014-07-03 22:45:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No but it sounds like we won't have a chance to talk on the hone until Sunday
2014-07-03 22:45:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's just not a great way to deal with issues 
2014-07-03 22:45:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's not really an issue, though
2014-07-03 22:46:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well how would I know that without talking to you and based on your recent texts?
2014-07-03 22:47:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whatever, if you don't want to talk to me I can't make you. 
2014-07-03 22:48:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight, have a safe drive tomorrow 
2014-07-03 22:57:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:/
2014-07-03 22:59:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't worrrrryyyyy
2014-07-03 23:01:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not worried, I'm unhappy with how this conversation went, that you'd rather push something under the rug than talk to me about it, that you ignored my call, and that you are ok with us ending a conversation with me being clearly nonplussed
2014-07-03 23:03:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know what I can say to you to make you feel nonplussed, but we can talk about it.
2014-07-03 23:04:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]non-nonplussed
2014-07-03 23:09:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if you don't think you can make me feel better, then you're right we shouldn't talk. I'll just go hang out with Amy and her roommates
2014-07-03 23:10:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the opposite opinion
2014-07-03 23:10:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but ok
2014-07-04 09:12:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Happy 4tg
2014-07-04 09:12:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*4th
2014-07-04 09:21:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Happy 4th to you.
2014-07-04 09:21:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you.
2014-07-04 09:22:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you too. I think I'm going to delete hangouts, and I'd prefer not to text.
2014-07-04 09:24:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you want to talk, let me know otherwise I'll talk to you later.
2014-07-04 09:24:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have fun with your friend 
2014-07-04 09:25:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So the only way we're going to communicate is on the phone?
2014-07-04 09:26:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And video whenever that opportunity happens I guess 
2014-07-04 09:29:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Alright. If that's what you want.
2014-07-04 21:16:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's your evening going? I'm free for the next 2 hours in the off chance you're not busy and want to talk
2014-07-04 22:09:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just got to Mary's. I'm on T-Mobile again so I only have 100 minutes for July.
2014-07-04 22:29:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh ok
2014-07-04 22:30:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well gas you got there safe
2014-07-04 22:30:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*Glad
2014-07-04 22:34:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you want to talk or are you about to be doing stuff?
2014-07-04 22:42:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is that a "no"?
2014-07-04 22:42:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm looking for a charger 
2014-07-04 22:43:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I'm at 10%
2014-07-04 22:44:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can use hangouts voice for like 10 minutes?
2014-07-04 22:46:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you getting these messages?
2014-07-04 22:46:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or do you only have Hangouts on your computer now?
2014-07-04 22:46:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think so... Do you want to chat for like 10 minutes?
2014-07-04 22:47:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't have a computer with me now
2014-07-04 22:47:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just my phone
2014-07-04 22:47:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I reinstalled hangouts
2014-07-04 22:48:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh two messages just showed up.
2014-07-04 22:49:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Three messages actually.
2014-07-04 22:49:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can use my phone.
2014-07-04 22:50:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] K well now I have 8% but we can talk for a second 
2014-07-04 22:52:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh well it's okay then.
2014-07-04 22:53:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh this is all so fucked
2014-07-04 23:01:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just tried calling you twice.
2014-07-04 23:01:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I tried calling you. I have no service but can use google voice
2014-07-04 23:02:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless that doesn't work for you?
2014-07-04 23:03:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't worry about it. Thanks for calling and trying, sorry if this interrupted your night. 
2014-07-04 23:08:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I keep getting messages en masse from you. Call me if you can.
2014-07-04 23:10:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did and left a message
2014-07-04 23:10:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go have fun
2014-07-04 23:10:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*voicemail message
2014-07-04 23:13:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure all this communication bullshit is not what you wanted to deal with on your visit. So don't worry anymore about it. We'll talk Sunday like the original plan was.
2014-07-04 23:14:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless you don't want to talk to me then either lol
2014-07-04 23:16:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm in bed.
2014-07-04 23:16:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You sound sad :(
2014-07-04 23:19:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Could we Skype call?
2014-07-04 23:21:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My phone won't make it
2014-07-04 23:21:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am sad, but I'll get over it
2014-07-04 23:25:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Grr.
2014-07-04 23:25:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This is some bullshit.
2014-07-04 23:27:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know what to tell you
2014-07-04 23:29:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fuck it I guess.
2014-07-04 23:35:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Google Voice was forwarding to my Straight Talk number.
2014-07-04 23:35:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should get calls now.
2014-07-04 23:36:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Too little too late I reckon.
2014-07-05 03:24:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Made it home, had a fun night. Talk to you later. Love you
2014-07-05 13:43:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hi honey
2014-07-05 13:58:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry about the past few days,  and I love you a lot a lot.
2014-07-05 14:06:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey, sugar. It's OK. I love you a lot too. We'll talk soon.
2014-07-05 14:07:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send me a pic of yo face, I miss it
2014-07-05 14:48:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😍😍😍
2014-07-05 17:22:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you do something with this Hangtime App?
2014-07-05 17:23:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No. Why?
2014-07-05 17:23:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I was getting text spam
2014-07-05 17:23:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And almost fell for it!
2014-07-05 17:24:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, I thought that was a typo for Hangouts.
2014-07-05 17:24:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely not.
2014-07-05 17:24:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It said it was from me?
2014-07-05 17:25:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-07-05 17:25:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you're the only person I know that is app savvy so I kinda assumed it was from you
2014-07-05 17:26:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah, OK. Yeah, I bet someone installed an app and gave it permission to invite contacts or something.
2014-07-05 17:26:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's weird that it wouldn't say who it was from, though.
2014-07-05 17:27:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the app wanted access to everything on my Facebook
2014-07-05 17:27:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, that sounds spammy.
2014-07-05 17:27:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're your plans tonight?
2014-07-05 17:27:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not sure. Might take it easy. We've had a busy day.
2014-07-05 17:27:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What about you?
2014-07-05 17:28:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got back from gin and cider tasting, so relaxing now until dinner. 
2014-07-05 17:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool. I miss you!
2014-07-05 17:29:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I accidentally looked at your bootie picture today.
2014-07-05 17:30:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh huh, accidentally...
2014-07-05 17:31:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha it was a nice accident. I opened the pictures thing in Instagram and was met with sexy Katie bootie. Had to back up quick haha.
2014-07-05 17:35:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you
2014-07-05 17:36:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We're getting closer.
2014-07-05 17:36:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you want to try the phone thing again in the next 2.25 hours I'm free now with full bars and full internet 
2014-07-05 17:37:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Butttt it's ok if that idea puts you off haha
2014-07-05 17:38:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok. We're gonna eat soon, but I should be able to call you after that.
2014-07-05 17:38:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why would it put me off? Because we were having issues last night?
2014-07-05 17:39:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I guess 
2014-07-05 17:39:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let me know when you're done eating 
2014-07-05 17:39:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-07-05 18:11:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Talk?
2014-07-05 18:14:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What media would you like to use? Hangouts video, or a phone call of some sort?
2014-07-05 18:14:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe Skype video?
2014-07-05 18:17:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K I'll pull it up
2014-07-05 18:18:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is 5ghz relatively fast?
2014-07-05 18:19:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's the frequency of the Internet waves from the Wi-Fi router.
2014-07-05 18:20:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not the Internet speed.
2014-07-05 18:20:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe just do phone.
2014-07-05 18:20:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm
2014-07-05 21:16:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love youuu
2014-07-05 21:17:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-07-05 21:17:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too... soooo much.
2014-07-05 21:19:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So much that just the thought of losing you can legitimately bring me down! I gotta fix that.
2014-07-05 21:20:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes you do! Though I've clearly had the same problem lately, with taking every minor complaint of yours as a sign of the relationship apocalypse 
2014-07-05 21:21:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha we seem to worry in different time frames.
2014-07-05 21:22:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Except mine doesn't really make sense to worry about.
2014-07-05 21:23:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Neither of them really make sense, cause we love each other a whole lot and are both totally devoted to making this work 
2014-07-05 21:23:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maaaan I love you.
2014-07-05 21:24:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can't wait to hold you again.
2014-07-05 21:24:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm itching for it
2014-07-05 21:25:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When I go to sleep I think about how much I want to intertwine my feet in yours
2014-07-05 21:25:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awwww
2014-07-05 21:25:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love that :)
2014-07-05 21:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know I've you this before, but I love how touchy you are like that.
2014-07-05 21:27:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Always trying to be wrapped up with me somehow.
2014-07-05 21:27:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're a good substrate for touchiness 
2014-07-05 21:27:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And yes I did just use a science word
2014-07-05 21:27:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha I was just about to comment on that.
2014-07-05 21:28:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Kinda random, but I was thinking you should give me a lap dance/strip tease sometime :)
2014-07-05 21:29:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely random haha, but I'll keep it in mind 
2014-07-05 21:30:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That would probably be easier for me with some lowered inhibitions 
2014-07-05 21:30:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There's no such thing as a strip dance right?
2014-07-05 21:30:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah?
2014-07-05 21:30:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm kinda surprised.
2014-07-05 21:31:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ehhh, I guess I could definitely get in the mood 
2014-07-05 21:31:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I might get a little giggly if I was sober 
2014-07-05 21:31:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I can see that.
2014-07-05 21:32:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I bet you'd get into it after a bit.
2014-07-05 21:32:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With the right music 
2014-07-05 21:32:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely 
2014-07-05 21:32:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we should find the right music :)
2014-07-05 21:34:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just like it when you feel sexy, and I like encouraging your sexiness.
2014-07-05 21:34:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And it seems like you enjoy feeling sexy and me being into your sexiness.
2014-07-05 21:35:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So it just seems like a good time.
2014-07-05 21:35:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha pretty much anything involving few clothes with you sounds like a good time 
2014-07-05 21:35:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you are really good and making me feel sexy
2014-07-05 21:36:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good point.
2014-07-05 21:37:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I feel more comfortable with you than I've felt with anyone, which helps 
2014-07-05 21:38:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, that makes me really happy.
2014-07-05 21:38:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we might be in love!
2014-07-05 21:39:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!!
2014-07-05 21:39:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All this sexy talk has got me pretty riled up
2014-07-05 21:39:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm gonna take a shower ;)
2014-07-05 21:40:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Get all sudsy and rub my hands between my legs and think of you thrusting behind me
2014-07-05 21:41:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha ok. Wish I could join you, push you up against the wall, and go deep inside you.
2014-07-05 21:41:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]!!!
2014-07-05 21:41:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We're so in sync sometimes.
2014-07-05 21:42:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We never get that explicit and both of us did at the same time haha.
2014-07-05 21:42:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We even had the same position in mind.
2014-07-05 21:42:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a pretty good position 
2014-07-05 21:42:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Indeed.
2014-07-05 21:43:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you and I reallyyyy wish you were here. I don't want Amy to realize why I'm getting so flushed though
2014-07-05 21:43:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-07-05 21:43:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really wish I was there too
2014-07-05 21:44:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have a good night, and have lots of wet dreams about me 
2014-07-05 21:44:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-07-05 21:44:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much. Sweet dreams, beautiful.
2014-07-06 12:57:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Went for a 4 Mile run today, on the ferry now, and I'm temporarily taking care of this dog!
2014-07-06 13:12:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cute! I'm about to eat some Kenyan in D.C. and then roll out.
2014-07-06 13:12:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was your run?
2014-07-06 13:14:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nommm
2014-07-06 13:15:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It involved a lot of hills, but felt pretty great afterwards
2014-07-06 13:17:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good :)
2014-07-06 13:38:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess "pulled the trigger" is a thing now
2014-07-06 15:35:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Driving to Raleigh. Have fun with your friend. Miss you.
2014-07-06 19:57:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhh I need a blog name!
2014-07-06 19:58:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Working title is Wet & Wild Genes...
2014-07-06 19:58:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate it
2014-07-06 20:07:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems a little risque to me
2014-07-06 20:08:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]risqué
2014-07-06 20:15:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't mind that part of it
2014-07-06 20:16:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It just doesn't flow well
2014-07-06 20:17:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wet & wild genetics sounds better to me
2014-07-06 20:17:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]agreed
2014-07-06 20:18:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok, wipe that idea completely from your mind for a second. What would you title a blog about your trials and successes and adventures as a nascent PhD student?
2014-07-06 20:19:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't think the title is a little forward, though?
2014-07-06 20:19:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my blog at work is called "Dealing with Data"
2014-07-06 20:19:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-06 20:19:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]butttt
2014-07-06 20:19:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]give me some keywords
2014-07-06 20:23:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't really believe in "being too forward" or in standards of "propriety" and "appropriateness" (which are mostly built around how males are titulated by certain things)
2014-07-06 20:23:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but that's a conversation for another day
2014-07-06 20:24:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]keywords: population genetics, adaptation, PhD student, marine species
2014-07-06 20:24:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha hmm believing something is one thing, though
2014-07-06 20:25:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't care what people think if those elements are important to them
2014-07-06 20:25:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you prolly should
2014-07-06 20:26:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do not want to have this conversation right now lol
2014-07-06 20:26:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok

2014-07-06 22:39:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why'd you ask for my birthday?
2014-07-06 22:45:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Looking at your zodiac 
2014-07-06 22:45:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, what do the stars say about us?
2014-07-06 22:47:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha interesting
2014-07-06 22:47:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your fair-weathered    😮 
2014-07-06 22:48:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're*
2014-07-06 22:48:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our relationship is
2014-07-06 22:48:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Apparently 
2014-07-06 22:48:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh it's describing the relationhsip
2014-07-06 22:48:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol @ scale back your need for stimulation
2014-07-06 22:51:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's interesting, but I think only 75% really relevant sounding 
2014-07-06 22:52:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]particularly the ideal for "work" and problematic for "friendship" part
2014-07-07 00:43:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I loved the snap!
2014-07-07 00:43:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kisses to you too
2014-07-07 11:02:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wait so you actually like Getting Ny Genes Wet? 
2014-07-07 11:02:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I kind of do, it's like "Getting my feet wet"
2014-07-07 11:10:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I do. I don't think it's sexual outside the context of our conversation, though.
2014-07-07 11:11:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok yeah me neither 
2014-07-07 11:12:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Being sexual wasn't actually a requirement
2014-07-07 11:12:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK. Wasn't sure if you were trying to be edgy or something haha
2014-07-07 11:13:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's work after your 3 day work week last week? 
2014-07-07 11:14:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fine. I'm just watching videos again. I'm waiting on Mike and Andrew to discuss my results.
2014-07-07 11:14:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are you up to?
2014-07-07 11:18:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Writing a blog post, doing some reminder research for my meeting this afternoon, mostly just chillin
2014-07-07 11:22:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool cool. How was your night?
2014-07-07 13:23:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Relaxing, just hung around and smoked and caught up
2014-07-07 13:23:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I'm being slow on the responses today 
2014-07-07 16:04:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When do you get done with work today?
2014-07-07 16:49:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm done.
2014-07-07 17:36:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok cool. I had a little downtime after my meeting and was seeing if you were free. How was work?
2014-07-07 17:37:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fine. Apparently one of the companies I found to have a really high probability of Red Hat Satellite, but didn't already have Red Hat Satellite, just started a beta version last week.
2014-07-07 17:37:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that seems to validate the model a bit
2014-07-07 17:37:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!
2014-07-07 17:37:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty cool
2014-07-07 17:37:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I thought so.
2014-07-07 17:37:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How has your day been?
2014-07-07 17:38:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Decent. My meeting with oyster biologists went well, and I got to catch up with my bro
2014-07-07 17:39:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's good
2014-07-07 17:39:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you doing now?
2014-07-07 17:40:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Going to the beach in a little bit
2014-07-07 17:40:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-07-07 17:40:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you staying in Seattle again?

2014-07-07 17:41:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, is she going with you?
2014-07-07 17:41:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm giving her a ride to Oregon 
2014-07-07 17:42:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-07-07 17:42:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]got any plans for tonight?
2014-07-07 17:45:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe a trivia night at this fun bar nearby?
2014-07-07 17:45:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You?
2014-07-07 17:45:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-07-07 17:47:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]More GoT?
2014-07-07 17:47:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe
2014-07-07 17:47:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're only 1.5 weeks away! I'm pretty excited
2014-07-07 17:48:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's a 24 day gap I break I guess
2014-07-07 17:48:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whoops
2014-07-07 17:48:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's a 24 day break I guess
2014-07-07 17:49:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Mary asked me how we did it.
2014-07-07 17:49:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-07 17:49:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How we waited that long between sleeping together?
2014-07-07 17:50:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol what... no
2014-07-07 17:50:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how we maintained a long distance relationship
2014-07-07 17:50:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha ok, just checking 
2014-07-07 17:52:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I told her I feel like I have an imaginary girlfriend at times
2014-07-07 17:52:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-07 17:52:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she got a kick out of that
2014-07-07 17:53:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Huh
2014-07-07 17:53:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess that's good? Lol
2014-07-07 17:54:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's good?
2014-07-07 17:54:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That you feel like you have an imaginary girlfriend
2014-07-07 17:55:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh
2014-07-07 17:55:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'm just not sure how to take that 
2014-07-07 17:56:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, don't read into it
2014-07-07 17:56:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just a funny way to describe long-distance relationships
2014-07-07 18:11:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you gonna buy some legal weed tomorrow?
2014-07-07 18:13:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha nah probably not. I don't want to drive with it
2014-07-07 18:16:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We should do cocaine sometime.
2014-07-07 18:36:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you did it on the reg in Miami, right?
2014-07-07 18:37:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could coach me up on it    😃 
2014-07-07 19:11:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha sure if you want 
2014-07-07 19:12:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a little overrated, and I would hardly say I did it on the reg ever 
2014-07-07 19:13:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd rather do a number of other drugs with you before that, but if you want to I'm down :)
2014-07-07 19:13:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I remember you saying it was overrated before, but I don't remember your reasoning why.
2014-07-07 19:14:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And what other drugs? LSD, shrooms, and MDMA?
2014-07-07 19:15:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All those, maybe in reverse order.
2014-07-07 19:16:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it's over rated for the price vs entertainment/good feelings value
2014-07-07 19:16:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it makes me feel pretty meh the next day
2014-07-07 19:16:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, okay. What if you take money out of the equation?
2014-07-07 19:18:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's still not my favorite 
2014-07-07 19:18:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-07-07 19:19:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'll start doing drugs more when I have a job.
2014-07-07 19:19:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'd think school would have less responsibility associated with it 
2014-07-07 19:20:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For sure, but lack of an income.
2014-07-07 19:20:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And no responsibilities on the weekend!
2014-07-07 19:20:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When working that is.
2014-07-07 19:20:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My problem has mainly always been lack of a contact.
2014-07-07 19:20:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I never look that hard.
2014-07-07 19:22:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I guess in just made contacts early at Miami and never had to practice looking around. What about your friend in Raleigh? But I actually think Haley's pot dealer has some connections 
2014-07-07 19:24:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what friend in Raleigh?
2014-07-07 19:24:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh
2014-07-07 19:24:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he probably knows where to get some MDMA I guess
2014-07-07 19:25:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if only this shit was just legal
2014-07-07 19:25:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-07 19:26:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why they gotta make it difficult for me
2014-07-07 19:26:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or if only I was just super rich
2014-07-07 19:26:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's actually what inspired this conversation
2014-07-07 19:26:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Johnny Manziel was photographed rolling up a bill
2014-07-07 19:26:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-07 19:26:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I was like "damn, I want to do that"
2014-07-07 19:27:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Silly Johnny
2014-07-07 19:27:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There definitely is something strangely attractive about snorting drugs
2014-07-07 19:28:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-07-07 19:28:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-07-07 19:28:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not like sexy attractive, it just had this cultural allure around it
2014-07-07 19:28:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-07-07 19:29:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't feel that way
2014-07-07 19:29:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Been idealized in pop culture 
2014-07-07 19:29:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just seems like a lot of people really enjoy cocaine
2014-07-07 19:29:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]particularly rich people
2014-07-07 19:29:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you figure they gotta be onto something
2014-07-07 19:29:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd like to do heroin too
2014-07-07 19:29:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think the needle freaks me out
2014-07-07 19:29:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a no for me
2014-07-07 19:29:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz of the needle
2014-07-07 19:29:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-07-07 19:30:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Partially, and it has a legitimate chance if killing you, and how addictive it is 
2014-07-07 19:31:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, maybe some other opiate would be better
2014-07-07 19:31:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you one like oxycodone or anything?
2014-07-07 19:35:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you hear about all this LeBron stuff?
2014-07-07 19:37:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What stuff?
2014-07-07 19:37:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]people are saying Cleveland is in the lead
2014-07-07 19:37:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm more of a fan of uppers than lowers
2014-07-07 19:37:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What???
2014-07-07 19:37:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-07-07 19:37:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the Heat just picked up Danny Granger apparently
2014-07-07 19:38:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which makes me think that might not be the case anymore
2014-07-07 19:40:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm thinking about taking a break from social media
2014-07-07 19:41:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't feel obligated to respond to me, by the way
2014-07-07 19:41:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just sort of riffing
2014-07-07 19:52:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I finally washed my sheets the other day.
2014-07-07 19:52:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There was a lot of jizz haha
2014-07-07 19:58:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]by other day, I mean last night
2014-07-07 20:00:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, I think I'm done

2014-07-07 20:03:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you! And I can't wait to get your sheets dirty again soon ;)
2014-07-08 08:00:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhhhh
2014-07-08 08:00:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I drank a little too much last night
2014-07-08 08:01:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. Had fun at least?
2014-07-08 08:01:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it turns out I have to be back in LA by10a tm

2014-07-08 12:19:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We got last place at trivia, and last place got $20 in free drinks 
2014-07-08 12:20:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I got vegetarian poutine which must've burned my mouth
2014-07-08 12:20:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it was soooo good
2014-07-08 12:25:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. That's kinda funny they give a prize to last place. I guess people don't bomb intentionally?
2014-07-08 12:30:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I guess, trivia honor?
2014-07-08 12:34:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You were just drinking at a bar, though?
2014-07-08 12:36:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, and we drank a bottle of wine at the beach before and did some topless sunbathing haha
2014-07-08 12:37:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice
2014-07-08 12:44:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought I was gonna play trivia tonight, but nobody has replied to my post.
2014-07-08 12:58:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aww
2014-07-08 12:58:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lame interns
2014-07-08 12:58:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Elin called!
2014-07-08 13:02:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How is she?
2014-07-08 13:09:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's ok, I'll probably call her back later
2014-07-08 13:09:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's still getting out of her funk
2014-07-08 13:44:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. Hangouts is effing up notifications again it seems.
2014-07-08 13:45:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Text instead
2014-07-08 13:45:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's probably my phone actually.
2014-07-08 13:45:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]?
2014-07-08 13:45:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This thing needs put out to pasture.
2014-07-08 13:46:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My Google Voice notifications have been screwy on my phone too.
2014-07-08 13:47:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not doing shit again today haha.
2014-07-08 13:48:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm gonna spend an extra hour not doing shit and leave a little early on Friday to the airport.
2014-07-08 13:48:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't decide if playing trivia by myself is too sad.
2014-07-08 13:49:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'll probably do it.
2014-07-08 19:06:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All things considered!
2014-07-08 19:06:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll call back later 
2014-07-08 19:06:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]okey dokey
2014-07-08 19:11:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Now that I'm thinking about it, I'm not sure I think a change of 6 to 10% is that big
2014-07-08 19:11:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that basically means in group of 10 people
2014-07-08 19:11:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]half a person more will be smoking weed
2014-07-08 19:11:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or in a group of 20 people
2014-07-08 19:11:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1 more person
2014-07-08 19:12:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I already took the bet, so I guess if the change happens I'll pay
2014-07-08 19:12:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think 6 to like 25% would've been more interesting
2014-07-08 19:16:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I also think it's funny that I still haven't been around you on drugs
2014-07-08 19:16:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]besides alcohol
2014-07-08 19:16:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*while you were on drugs
2014-07-08 19:16:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least I don't think so?
2014-07-08 19:43:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.cracked.com/article_21017_5-unexpected-things-i-learned-from-being-heroin-addict_p2.html
2014-07-08 19:45:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like most  opioids , unadulterated heroin does not cause many long-term complications other than   dependence   and   constipation . [ 40 ]
2014-07-08 19:45:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin
2014-07-08 19:46:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] It is prevalent in heroin coming from   Afghanistan , which in 2004 produced roughly 87% of the world supply in illicit   raw opium . [ 8 ]
2014-07-08 19:46:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Illegal heroin funds terrorism
2014-07-08 19:47:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] In particular, users report an intense   rush , an acute transcendent state of   euphoria ,
2014-07-08 19:47:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sounds like fun
2014-07-08 19:47:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Diacetylmorphine, almost always still called by its original trade name of heroin in non-medical settings, is used as a recreational drug for the  transcendent   relaxation and intense   euphoria   it induces.  
2014-07-08 19:49:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Depending on the quantity, type, frequency, and duration of opioid use, acute physical withdrawal symptoms last for as little as two to seven days (for short-acting opioids such as  hydromorphone   [Dilaudid] and   oxycodone ) and as long as seven to ten days for long-acting opioids such as   buprenorphine   and   methadone . [ 8 ]
2014-07-08 19:50:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sign me up for some clean, legal heroin
2014-07-08 20:30:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sorry I come across in whatever way I am coming across.
2014-07-08 20:30:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said I was gonna stop talking about shit like this!
2014-07-08 20:30:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-08 20:30:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know why I have the impulse to voice my opinion on these things that I really can't cahnge.
2014-07-08 20:31:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna try to cut back.
2014-07-08 20:37:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can actually help me out!
2014-07-08 20:37:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]be like, "you can't change this"
2014-07-08 20:37:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can be my Jiminy Cricket
2014-07-08 21:42:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you were on your computer??
2014-07-08 21:42:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm getting Taco Bell. They just cut me off. That timing was impeccable.
2014-07-08 21:43:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nailed it
2014-07-08 21:44:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll call you back in a few.
2014-07-08 21:44:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We still have so much more days in July though!
2014-07-08 21:45:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can talk to you on my computer for the vast majority of them, though.
2014-07-08 21:46:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This talking on the phone thing has really only been the past few days.
2014-07-08 21:46:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish I would've known, though. I would've just stuck with Straight Talk.
2014-07-08 22:06:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Birthday Cake is a better club song
2014-07-08 22:06:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but Birthday is better
2014-07-08 22:07:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Birthday Cake" was clearly written to get people grinding on each other
2014-07-08 22:09:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're both pretty silly
2014-07-08 22:27:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Minimum I could add was $10 so I guess I have 100 minutes
2014-07-08 22:28:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, you need to pick me out some new sandals too.
2014-07-08 22:40:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I didn't even get to appreciate your jeans!
2014-07-08 22:40:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha true.
2014-07-08 22:40:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How long did we talk cumulatively 
2014-07-08 22:41:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A few hours probably?

2014-07-08 22:42:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]EST

2014-07-08 22:44:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The weather channel app says 10% chance of rain and it's storming pretty hard outside haha
2014-07-08 22:44:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]2:46 hrs
2014-07-08 22:45:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Most of it was me annoying you haha.
2014-07-08 22:45:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Still not 100% why you like me, lol
2014-07-08 22:45:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Guess I'll have to keep serving up the orgasms ;)

2014-07-09 19:52:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not really sure why it's happening
2014-07-09 19:53:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you meant I was killing babies somehow 
2014-07-09 19:53:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm guessing they'll explain it next episode
2014-07-09 19:53:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-09 19:53:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, eating tacos is sinful
2014-07-09 19:53:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Most plot tangents don't get truly "explained" or "resolved" in this show
2014-07-09 19:54:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just more complicated 
2014-07-09 19:54:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I literally have no idea who these people were, though
2014-07-09 19:54:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have no idea why these guys were killing babies and children
2014-07-09 19:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looking for a bastard or something
2014-07-09 19:54:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't know whose

2014-07-10 12:50:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's crazy how loving, AND sexually arousing, AND intellectually stimulating our relationship is.
2014-07-10 12:51:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even though I sometimes get sassy and roll my eyes at you for no reason?
2014-07-10 12:51:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] 😃 
2014-07-10 12:52:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah, I definitely deserve it sometimes.

2014-07-10 13:05:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've been thinking about it all day actually.

2014-07-10 13:13:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]100% worth it

2014-07-10 15:04:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My head hurts too much to watch tv, to sleep, to read, to go out and get food, or to clean
2014-07-10 15:04:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need my man
2014-07-10 15:04:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And some Advil lol

2014-07-10 16:32:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My source is just evidence that other people occasionally call them boxes
2014-07-10 16:32:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even if those people showcase a stuffed bunny rabbit measuring in "erasures" 
2014-07-10 16:34:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-07-10 16:35:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can just see you sitting at your computer muttering "I'll find you some fucking boxes of ice cream..."
2014-07-10 16:37:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahahaha

2014-07-10 17:07:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] That's what I typed
2014-07-10 17:07:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never heard of any of this dude's movies
2014-07-10 17:07:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You typed Snowpiecer
2014-07-10 17:07:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I read it as Snowpiece
2014-07-10 17:08:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you like about his movies?
2014-07-10 17:09:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]a lot of dark humor in his movies
2014-07-10 17:10:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]he's known to take a stereotypical genre and change it to include surprising yet subtle elements
2014-07-10 17:11:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm I see
2014-07-10 17:11:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which movie would you recommend?
2014-07-10 17:11:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm betting we don't make it to that After Hours thing, haha
2014-07-10 17:11:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've only seen 3
2014-07-10 17:11:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but which one do you recommend? haha
2014-07-10 17:12:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah we def shouldn't buy tickets ahead of time, but just in case we get bored with naked cuddling and staring deeply into each other's eyes
2014-07-10 17:12:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-10 17:12:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the Host and Mother
2014-07-10 17:12:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-07-10 17:13:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like the special effects in the Host might bug you, but if you look past that to the subject matter or take it as intentional camp then you'll like it
2014-07-10 17:13:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting.
2014-07-10 17:14:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What makes you think the special effects will bug me?
2014-07-10 17:15:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, maybe they won't
2014-07-10 17:16:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]they just seem cheap for the year it came out, and you seem to appreciate cinematographic quality at least a little
2014-07-10 17:17:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-07-10 17:17:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'll give it a shot
2014-07-10 17:17:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I can find it
2014-07-10 17:18:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the Host is no netflix
2014-07-10 17:18:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I found a torrent
2014-07-10 17:18:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's on Netflix?
2014-07-10 17:18:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-07-10 17:18:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok

2014-07-10 17:19:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]somewhere in my pile of boxes at Chicago lol
2014-07-10 17:19:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-10 17:19:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you feel better?
2014-07-10 17:21:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just ate a medium pizza and cheesy bacon chicken from dominos
2014-07-10 17:21:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and found my advil
2014-07-10 17:21:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so yes
2014-07-10 17:21:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-10 17:21:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you ate the whole pizza?
2014-07-10 17:23:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hell yeah
2014-07-10 17:23:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-07-10 17:28:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't even ask yesterday... do you think about me when you masturbate?
2014-07-10 17:32:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]at least 75% of the time
2014-07-10 17:32:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's the other 25%?
2014-07-10 17:33:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]kinda mindless I guess, or just enjoying the feeling
2014-07-10 17:35:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-07-10 17:35:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you just think about us doing it basically?
2014-07-10 17:38:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah, sometimes a little more developed of a plot line maybe, or sometimes just flashes
2014-07-10 17:39:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]of images and remembering orgasms or things we've done
2014-07-10 17:39:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-07-10 17:39:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you ever think about stuff we haven't done
2014-07-10 17:39:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-07-10 17:40:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hmmm maybe sometimes, like having sex somewhere/way we haven't
2014-07-10 17:41:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like bent over a table or up against a wall or in a hot tub
2014-07-10 17:41:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or on molly
2014-07-10 17:41:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess i've gotten turned on thinking about that too haha
2014-07-10 17:41:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really?
2014-07-10 17:42:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like that'd be hard for me to imagine!
2014-07-10 17:42:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we've done it against a wall
2014-07-10 17:42:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely down with bending you over a table
2014-07-10 17:42:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not sure about the hot tub
2014-07-10 17:43:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I like the whole "second we walk in the door fuck in the hallway with some clothes still on" fantasy
2014-07-10 17:43:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, ok
2014-07-10 17:43:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and hot tub or bath tub are ones I'm fully aware are probably better in my imagination than in actuality haha
2014-07-10 17:44:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-07-10 17:44:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whatever works!
2014-07-10 17:47:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think about your face and the noises you make when you come
2014-07-10 17:48:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and the way you grab my hips and arch your back
2014-07-10 17:48:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-07-10 17:48:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty sexy
2014-07-10 17:49:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like we would have to specifically plan to have sex on MDMA
2014-07-10 17:49:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like do it at home with the explicit purpose of having sex
2014-07-10 17:50:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or we can go to a show and come home and take a little more
2014-07-10 17:50:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-07-10 17:50:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I've never taken an extra dose after starting to come down
2014-07-10 17:51:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]have you had sex while coming down?
2014-07-10 17:51:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't had sex on MDMA
2014-07-10 17:51:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's why I was saying we'd have to explicitly plan it
2014-07-10 17:51:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but you've done it with girlfriends?
2014-07-10 17:51:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with Hannah yes
2014-07-10 17:52:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really recall an impulse to have sex really
2014-07-10 17:52:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's why I'm saying we'd have to like plan for it explicitly
2014-07-10 17:52:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hmmm I see
2014-07-10 17:53:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought that was actually more normal
2014-07-10 17:53:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe
2014-07-10 17:54:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think especially when you're out at a show or something you're not going to have that desire
2014-07-10 17:55:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I think I also have the capacity to feel more sexual on drugs than most
2014-07-10 17:55:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]obviously a big fan of sex on MDMA, though?
2014-07-10 17:55:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm down to plan for a night in, just you and I
2014-07-10 17:56:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It can be pretty great
2014-07-10 17:57:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very sensual, the other person feels like the center of your universe
2014-07-10 17:57:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and our sex is already a lot like that
2014-07-10 17:58:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]plus giving/getting head is pretty much the bomb
2014-07-10 17:58:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah?
2014-07-10 17:58:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why giving?
2014-07-10 17:58:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no gag reflexes
2014-07-10 17:58:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-07-10 17:59:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and your empathetic feelings are so heightened
2014-07-10 17:59:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess that makes sense
2014-07-10 17:59:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I guess you can take my sex on MDMA virginity
2014-07-10 18:00:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we don't have to if you don't think you'd want to
2014-07-10 18:00:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm definitely down!
2014-07-10 18:00:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how could I not want to with how you're describing it
2014-07-10 18:01:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]some of the sex we've had has already been better than any sex I've had on mdma, which I would've not really thought was possible
2014-07-10 18:02:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so yeah, I think it could be a good time
2014-07-10 18:02:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-10 18:02:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder what it is about me that makes sex so good for you
2014-07-10 18:03:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]also, why do you think you were teething my penis initially?
2014-07-10 18:04:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know!
2014-07-10 18:04:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really thought I was covering up my teeth, but maybe my lips were tired or something
2014-07-10 18:05:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah, I was pretty surprised when you said you'd given like 250 blowjobs or whatever it was
2014-07-10 18:05:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean most of them were in high school or the beginning of college
2014-07-10 18:05:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so maybe I was out of practice
2014-07-10 18:06:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but you're kind of making me feel bad again about it
2014-07-10 18:06:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok I'm sorry
2014-07-10 18:08:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's ok
2014-07-10 18:25:46[SEP]Michael A.

2014-07-10 18:32:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah I've been home!
2014-07-10 18:32:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I forgot about the time change
2014-07-10 18:33:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]3 hours is pretty inconvenient
2014-07-10 18:33:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not gonna lie
2014-07-10 18:33:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it hasn't been terrible
2014-07-10 18:33:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]except fir maybe last night when you were up until 2a
2014-07-10 18:34:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]4
2014-07-10 18:34:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!!
2014-07-10 18:34:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it hasn't really been bad cuz you've been busy
2014-07-10 18:34:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if this was how it was on the regular I think it'd be pretty annoying
2014-07-10 18:35:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we'd figure it out, but no time difference is nice
2014-07-10 18:36:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what're you doing for the rest of the day
2014-07-10 18:38:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]same thing i've been doing

2014-07-10 18:38:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sitting on this couch

2014-07-10 18:39:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what've you been up to?
2014-07-10 18:39:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.google.com/trends/explore#q=ice%20cream%20carton%2C%20ice%20cream%20box
2014-07-10 18:40:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've been talking to you about your masturbating habits
2014-07-10 18:40:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and planning our sex adventure on MDMA
2014-07-10 18:40:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you got me pretty excited about it
2014-07-10 18:40:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish we were doing it soon
2014-07-10 18:41:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hahaha this conversation got me pretty excited in general
2014-07-10 18:41:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we should try to do it in august
2014-07-10 18:42:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]as I'm assuming neither of us will find some by next week
2014-07-10 18:42:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could ask my Raleigh friend if you wanted!
2014-07-10 18:43:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If that wouldn't be out of your way, sure
2014-07-10 18:44:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'll ask him
2014-07-10 18:45:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we wouldn't necessarily have to do it really late at night either
2014-07-10 18:46:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How much do you do.
2014-07-10 18:46:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How much do you do?
2014-07-10 18:46:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do three tabs of X
2014-07-10 18:47:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so pressed pills?
2014-07-10 18:47:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know what the equivalent of Molly is
2014-07-10 18:47:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-07-10 18:47:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]a tab is supposed to be around .1
2014-07-10 18:48:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much do you do
2014-07-10 18:48:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I take at least .2, but not all at once
2014-07-10 18:48:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do two wait 15 then do the last one
2014-07-10 18:48:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have to do three
2014-07-10 18:48:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or else I don't get the the euphoria
2014-07-10 18:49:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we should ask if he has molly
2014-07-10 18:49:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's usually less speedy
2014-07-10 18:49:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]doesn't that depend on the source?
2014-07-10 18:49:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he sounds like he has a legit hookup
2014-07-10 18:49:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just isn't sure whether or not he'll be able to get it here in time
2014-07-10 18:49:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]pressed pills almost always are cut with speed
2014-07-10 18:50:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well if it won't work out for next weekend that's ok
2014-07-10 18:50:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do you know that?
2014-07-10 18:51:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've had a number of drug dealer friends and read alot of websites/forums before I decided to try it for the 1st time
2014-07-10 18:52:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and always checked on here  http://www.pillreports.com
2014-07-10 18:53:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they typically had speed?
2014-07-10 18:54:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]methamphetimines and/or piperazine
2014-07-10 18:54:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I guess I don't mind whatever else is in the shit I've taken
2014-07-10 18:54:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and even if they aren't cut with that, they can vary a lot in the amount of mdma per pill
2014-07-10 18:55:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah I don't mind either, except it makes me feel a lot shittier the next day and the euphoria feelings have typically been much stronger on molly
2014-07-10 18:55:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the only time I've done Molly hasn't been great either time
2014-07-10 18:56:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe we just had a good X source
2014-07-10 18:56:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why wasn't it great?
2014-07-10 18:56:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the first time I didn't feel any euphoria
2014-07-10 18:56:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just sped up
2014-07-10 18:56:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]second time just reached the point right before the wave hits you
2014-07-10 18:56:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but never got over the hump
2014-07-10 18:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and just felt weird
2014-07-10 18:57:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well whatever your friend recommends is probably fine
2014-07-10 18:57:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think he's gonna be able to get it to us
2014-07-10 18:58:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna ask a dude at work, though I think
2014-07-10 18:58:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]?
2014-07-10 18:59:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what
2014-07-10 19:00:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]who do you know at work that does drugs?
2014-07-10 19:00:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Diego Fernandez

2014-07-10 19:05:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think this proves I was right :)
2014-07-10 19:07:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've seriously never heard it before
2014-07-10 19:07:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you usually refer to them as ice cream boxes?
2014-07-10 19:08:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or boxes of ice cream?
2014-07-10 19:09:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i guess
2014-07-10 19:10:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=ice+cream+box%2Cice+cream+carton&year_start=1800&year_end=2000&corpus=15&smoothing=3&share=&direct_url=t1%3B%2Cice%20cream%20box%3B%2Cc0%3B.t1%3B%2Cice%20cream%20carton%3B%2Cc0

2014-07-10 19:10:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hmmm
2014-07-10 19:10:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is probably more reflective of how people actually use the words
2014-07-10 19:13:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]probably
2014-07-10 19:13:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think i might use carton and tub and box interchangably
2014-07-10 19:14:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I use carton for like the pint-sized things you get in the store
2014-07-10 19:14:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd probably say tub for the big buckets
2014-07-10 19:14:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i use pints for pints
2014-07-10 19:14:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bullshit
2014-07-10 19:16:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no, I say I want a pint of ice cream
2014-07-10 19:16:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if ice cream was sitting on the counter
2014-07-10 19:16:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'd say
2014-07-10 19:16:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you hand me that pint of ice cream?
2014-07-10 19:17:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's empty
2014-07-10 19:17:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz we're talking about the container here

2014-07-10 21:54:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]everybody gets cranky
2014-07-10 21:54:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and your crankiness is barely noticeable

2014-07-10 21:54:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've made it pretty clear you aren't ever intentionally trying to rub me the wrong way
2014-07-10 21:54:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially since right now it has absolutely nothing to do with you and talking to you overall made me feel a lot better and happier
2014-07-10 21:54:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly
2014-07-10 21:55:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad us talking made you feel better    😃

2014-07-10 22:23:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder what our average would drop to
2014-07-10 22:24:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think once a day for a pretty long time
2014-07-10 22:24:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-07-10 22:24:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd definitely be down with that!
2014-07-10 22:24:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, some says 2 and every once in a while none 
2014-07-10 22:24:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*days
2014-07-10 22:24:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I gotcha
2014-07-10 22:24:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some days 3 in an afternoon haha
2014-07-10 22:25:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's "a pretty long time" to you?
2014-07-10 22:25:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-10 22:25:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ideally forever
2014-07-10 22:25:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I can definitely get down with that
2014-07-10 22:25:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll try my best to keep you interested!
2014-07-10 22:25:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I bet once we start living together we'd be at that average for at least a year, barring any long separations 
2014-07-10 22:26:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I've never lived with someone though
2014-07-10 22:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if we averaged once a day for a year I'd be pretty impressed
2014-07-10 22:27:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you think is a reasonable/likely average?
2014-07-10 22:27:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know
2014-07-10 22:27:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't be surprised
2014-07-10 22:27:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if we averaged once a day
2014-07-10 22:27:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're most likely gonna dictate the average
2014-07-10 22:28:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I can definitely imagine you maintaining a once a day average
2014-07-10 22:28:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it would be impressive
2014-07-10 22:28:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like when you initiate sex too though
2014-07-10 22:28:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-07-10 22:28:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's kinda sexy    😃 
2014-07-10 22:29:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just don't ever want you to feel obligated to have sex
2014-07-10 22:29:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe one day you'll initiate it when I'm really not feeling it, but you do such a good job of getting me in the mood(even just by being naked next to me!) that I have a hard time believing that would happen often
2014-07-10 22:29:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would definitely say no
2014-07-10 22:30:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok cool
2014-07-10 22:30:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I really didn't want to haha, don't worry about that
2014-07-10 22:30:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. Well yeah, I'll definitely initiate when we're living together then.
2014-07-10 22:31:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can initiate it next week too ;)
2014-07-10 22:31:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds good to me    😃 
2014-07-10 22:31:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like we're both already initiated when we've been together, though
2014-07-10 22:31:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-10 22:32:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'd mostly just be really happy that you were maintaining that level of attraction to me to keep up a once a day average
2014-07-10 22:33:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well it's attraction to you + I really enjoy the orgasms you give me
2014-07-10 22:33:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-10 22:33:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At the very very least, it'd be great stress relied!
2014-07-10 22:33:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm ok with being your personal orgasm machine
2014-07-10 22:33:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-07-10 22:33:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm definitely down with that too
2014-07-10 22:34:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd like making you feel good and relaxing you at the same time
2014-07-10 22:35:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like that I turn you on, and how often you want me
2014-07-10 22:36:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're very good at turning me on
2014-07-10 22:36:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-07-10 22:37:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright my sex god
2014-07-10 22:37:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-10 22:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]real quick
2014-07-10 22:37:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yesss?
2014-07-10 22:37:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in 1974 married couples ranging in age from 18-24 had sex 3.25 times per week
2014-07-10 22:37:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm trying to find a more recent data set
2014-07-10 22:38:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well we're almost out of that age range haha
2014-07-10 22:38:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I am out of that age range
2014-07-10 22:39:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fucking articles dancing around the question
2014-07-10 22:39:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just give me the average
2014-07-10 22:40:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.kinseyinstitute.org/resources/FAQ.html
2014-07-10 22:41:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want couples, though
2014-07-10 22:41:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how many times do the average couple have sex in a week
2014-07-10 22:41:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It gives partners
2014-07-10 22:41:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]married people it seems pretty low
2014-07-10 22:41:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2-3 times per month
2014-07-10 22:42:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-07-10 22:42:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see it now
2014-07-10 22:42:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-07-10 22:42:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so once a day would probably put us in like the 99th percentile
2014-07-10 22:42:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or something
2014-07-10 22:43:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting that there's more of a drop between the 18-24 and 25-29 than the 25-29 to 30-39
2014-07-10 22:43:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]by a lot
2014-07-10 22:44:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it actually goes up it looks like
2014-07-10 22:44:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'd be in like the 95%
2014-07-10 22:44:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for the 30-39 range
2014-07-10 22:44:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well it's 4 or more
2014-07-10 22:44:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And yeah those numbers are interesting
2014-07-10 22:44:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]4 or more gets you to 95%
2014-07-10 22:44:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah yeah
2014-07-10 22:45:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm assuming each extra day in your average moves you up quite a bit
2014-07-10 22:45:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe 5 times a week is more realistic 
2014-07-10 22:45:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's still periods to deal with 
2014-07-10 22:47:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I personally count that time.
2014-07-10 22:47:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those people in the survey did
2014-07-10 22:48:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the thing with us is we could easily binge occasionally, which would keep our average relatively high.
2014-07-10 22:48:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Binge
2014-07-10 22:48:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what it feels like sometimes haha, I even get a little wombly afterwards
2014-07-10 22:49:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha what?
2014-07-10 22:49:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When we have like a whole afternoon of sexing
2014-07-10 22:49:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I get up to shower or get dressed, I sometimes feel like I'm coming up for air or tipsy from too much alcohol
2014-07-10 22:50:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like binge drinking I guess
2014-07-10 22:50:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha yeah me too actually.
2014-07-10 22:51:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I guess in the end it's just a number. I think you'll keep me satisfied and I hope I can do the same for you.
2014-07-10 22:52:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You think???
2014-07-10 22:53:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And the really great thing is we've already established a really great culture of openness in our relationship so I don't think either of us would hesitate to bring up any issues we were having
2014-07-10 22:53:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hope that continues to be the case!
2014-07-10 22:55:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now I reallllllyyyy am going to bed
2014-07-10 22:55:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're so good at drawing me in
2014-07-10 22:56:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well maybe you shouldn't be so nice to talk to!
2014-07-10 22:56:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's addictive!
2014-07-10 22:56:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or send you pics of my tits
2014-07-10 22:57:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*titties
2014-07-10 22:57:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha man I love me some Katie titties
2014-07-10 22:57:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love me some Michael Alcorn dick 
2014-07-10 22:58:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha confirmed
2014-07-10 22:59:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That time you out it between your tits was really fucking sexy.
2014-07-10 22:59:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It felt good too.
2014-07-10 23:00:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Also surprised me!
2014-07-10 23:00:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why did it surprise you?
2014-07-10 23:01:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We just hadn't done it before and I haven't really done that a lot.
2014-07-10 23:02:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like we're getting to the point where we're both comfortable enough to experiment a little bit?
2014-07-10 23:03:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah sure. I don't know how experimental I am really, but I'm down with trying different things out.
2014-07-10 23:03:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't mean like superrrr experimental 
2014-07-10 23:04:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well like what?
2014-07-10 23:05:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess just trying little things like that, which you may not do the first few times your having sex
2014-07-10 23:06:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know what I mean 
2014-07-10 23:06:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK :)
2014-07-10 23:06:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying to go to bed my love
2014-07-10 23:06:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok I'm sorry.
2014-07-10 23:06:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-07-10 23:07:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet dreams! And safe travels tomorrow (though I'm sure I'll talk to you before your flight)
2014-07-10 23:08:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you.
2014-07-10 23:08:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And you are ridiculously sexy.
2014-07-11 09:15:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're going to hate the delivery, but I think you'll like the science :)  http://elitedaily.com/women/scientific-benefits-cuddling/661564/
2014-07-11 10:19:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I generally dislike elite daily's style 
2014-07-11 10:20:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I like these findings
2014-07-11 10:26:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd never even heard of the site before.
2014-07-11 10:30:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]From the WSJ article mentioned: In a 2010 study of 29 couples, women who had fewer negative interactions with their partners during the day slept better that night. For men, it was reversed: Better sleep led to fewer negative interactions with their partners the next day. Interestingly, on the days women said they had more positive interactions with their partners and fewer negative ones, the men slept better at night, too. "Women tend to drive the emotional content of the relationships," says Dr. Troxel, who co-wrote the study. "Husbands may take up a stronger signal" from wives.
2014-07-11 10:30:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It pops up on my Facebook from sisters and other friends 
2014-07-11 10:30:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's a pretty interesting dynamic
2014-07-11 10:30:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That is interesting 
2014-07-11 10:31:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A feedback of sorts
2014-07-11 10:31:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I definitely don't sleep well when I've got bad vibes, though.
2014-07-11 10:32:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's what the second part is saying.
2014-07-11 10:32:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-07-11 10:34:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Got a solid 10 hours in last night 
2014-07-11 10:34:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel much better
2014-07-11 10:34:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good :)
2014-07-11 10:38:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Where should I eat lunch today?
2014-07-11 10:38:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My pussy
2014-07-11 10:39:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha oh, man. I'm cracking up in my cubicle.
2014-07-11 10:40:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP];)
2014-07-11 10:40:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I dunno, where should I eat breakfast?
2014-07-11 10:40:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My dick!
2014-07-11 10:41:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm gonna have a beer at lunch today.
2014-07-11 10:41:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmmm
2014-07-11 10:41:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Party animal 
2014-07-11 10:41:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know. Rebel to the core.
2014-07-11 10:43:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So is the sex like continuous on MDMA?
2014-07-11 10:43:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It takes a reallyyyy long time for a dude to come 
2014-07-11 10:43:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And a pretty long time for me
2014-07-11 10:44:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok yeah I guess that answers my question.
2014-07-11 10:44:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it could vary, sometimes just hours of sex, sometimes take a cuddle and talk break, hop in the shower
2014-07-11 10:46:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I've ever just taken mdma to have sex though 
2014-07-11 10:46:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's always been like a follow up to an event 
2014-07-11 10:46:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And you just reupped when you got back?
2014-07-11 10:47:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And then had hours of sex? Haha
2014-07-11 10:47:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Depending on where we were at, yeah might do some dips or snort a little or drink Molly water
2014-07-11 10:48:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never heard of any of those things haha
2014-07-11 10:48:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That is a benefit if crystal or powder mdma I guess 
2014-07-11 10:48:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How many times have you had sex on MDMA?
2014-07-11 10:49:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]7 ish
2014-07-11 10:49:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. Did you always like plan on it happening I guess?
2014-07-11 10:49:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not necessarily 
2014-07-11 10:50:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's a drop?
2014-07-11 10:50:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or dip I mean
2014-07-11 10:50:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There were a few times an ex boyfriend and I were just really tired and would just pass out or stay up and talk 
2014-07-11 10:51:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you have powder in a bag, and you get some on your finger and rub it on your gums
2014-07-11 10:51:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh ok.
2014-07-11 10:51:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like a little bump, brings your right back up
2014-07-11 10:52:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice.
2014-07-11 10:52:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I guess it's weird I haven't had sex on it.
2014-07-11 10:56:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even the 1st time I rolled at Ultra, I felt very sensual and kind of just wanted to kiss all of my friends and every attractive girl I saw haha
2014-07-11 10:57:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But kissing is different from having sex I guess.
2014-07-11 10:58:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like I definitely kissed and rubbed, etc., but the desire for full blown sex wasn't there.
2014-07-11 10:58:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sex was definitely on the mind.
2014-07-11 10:59:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hannah and I talked really openly about sex the first time we rolled together
2014-07-11 10:59:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it wasn't like we wanted to have sex right then.
2014-07-11 11:00:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. It'll be an adventure I'm sure!
2014-07-11 11:01:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe the fact that I never reupped afterwards has something to do with it. Like being in bed while rolling hard still might've made it different.
2014-07-11 11:10:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe, I guess we'll just see what happens!
2014-07-11 11:10:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even if we don't want to have sex, it'll still be fun to do together 
2014-07-11 11:11:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I'm sure I'll want to have sex if you want to, which sounds like you probably will, lol
2014-07-11 11:12:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really hope Diego can get us some.
2014-07-11 11:15:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If not, we can definitely find some by August
2014-07-11 11:17:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have you ever been in a threesome? Have I asked you that before?
2014-07-11 11:18:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know. I was almost in a 3some, but none of us actually ended up having sex together
2014-07-11 11:18:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess it was still sort of a 3some
2014-07-11 11:19:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]MFF?
2014-07-11 11:19:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-07-11 11:19:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's definitely been a fantasy of mine
2014-07-11 11:19:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why didn't the sex happen?
2014-07-11 11:21:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The girl was mostly lesbian, and someone I had kind of been seeing. The guy was a good friend of ours and had been an on/off again hook up buddy of mine. But neither of us really wanted penetration with him, which I think he was a little bummed about, but totally respectful of
2014-07-11 11:22:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see.
2014-07-11 11:22:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm surprised you weren't able to make one happen in Miami if it's a fantasy of yours.
2014-07-11 11:22:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I probably wouldn't count that as a threesome.
2014-07-11 11:23:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I definitely would not if I was the guy.
2014-07-11 11:23:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Everyone had an orgasm
2014-07-11 11:24:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And as we learned he other day 53% of men consider a hand job sex
2014-07-11 11:24:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe a like PG-13 threesome?
2014-07-11 11:24:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha sure
2014-07-11 11:24:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cam was way too shy/insecure to ever seriously consider the idea
2014-07-11 11:25:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I think before that we were too young to really move into that area
2014-07-11 11:25:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'd only want to do it with people I was really comfortable with
2014-07-11 11:26:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh okay. That's the best explanation.
2014-07-11 11:27:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you ever considered doing one?
2014-07-11 11:29:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I sort of floated the idea to Hannah, but I wasn't completely straight forward and she definitely did not seem on board.
2014-07-11 11:29:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was about to say I don't know a guy who wouldn't, but you just provided an example haha
2014-07-11 11:30:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do think it's pretty risky, though
2014-07-11 11:30:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](psychologically)
2014-07-11 11:31:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So you'd have to do a pretty good job of convincing me you'd be okay with it before I would do it.
2014-07-11 11:32:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If that became something we ever considered doing.
2014-07-11 11:32:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I agree, and I think it's something I would only want to do after we had been together a long time
2014-07-11 11:33:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can't wait for our 50 year old threesome ;)
2014-07-11 11:33:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha 
2014-07-11 11:34:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not that long
2014-07-11 11:34:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But not while we're long distance 
2014-07-11 11:34:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously
2014-07-11 11:35:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you ever consider a MMF?
2014-07-11 11:35:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I'm just messing around. I'm honestly okay with it never happening. I'm completely sexually satisfied by you and I definitely don't want to fuck it up.
2014-07-11 11:35:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No.
2014-07-11 11:35:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you would want one?
2014-07-11 11:37:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, I think the circumstances would have to be really really specific, and it wouldn't involve gay activities. Maybe it's a slight fantasy to have 2 guys pleasuring me at the same time. 
2014-07-11 11:37:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But very slight
2014-07-11 11:37:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As for FFM, I would definitely not just be doing that for your benefit 
2014-07-11 11:38:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm well I'm not trying to stop you from fulfilling a fantasy.
2014-07-11 11:38:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know how I'd respond to seeing you fucking or sucking another guy.
2014-07-11 11:38:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha don't worry, I've already decided that one probably won't ever happen
2014-07-11 11:39:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But maybe I can work on that.
2014-07-11 11:39:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That may be our 50 year old 3some
2014-07-11 11:39:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-07-11 11:40:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha. Maybe you could do it without me.
2014-07-11 11:41:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm so perfectly happy with our sex life right now, I don't even want to think about sleeping with another man 
2014-07-11 11:42:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In any capacity 
2014-07-11 11:43:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha ok. Don't want you to feel like you're missing out is all.
2014-07-11 11:45:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've had like 8 orgasms in a day
2014-07-11 11:45:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm in the 99.99 percentile there
2014-07-11 11:46:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah probably.
2014-07-11 11:48:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why'd the 3some topic come up?
2014-07-11 11:49:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess just an extension on our sexual history discussion.
2014-07-11 11:51:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's been rounded out at this point. I guess there's a some random other things I don't know if you've done before.
2014-07-11 11:53:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True, and I probably gave you the slightly abridged version of who I've slept with and how much. 
2014-07-11 11:53:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha what does that mean?
2014-07-11 11:54:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't name and date everyone I've slept with 
2014-07-11 11:54:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which was a little easier for you to do 
2014-07-11 11:55:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we have plenty of time to get to know every little thing there is to know about each other :)
2014-07-11 11:55:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh. I guess that doesn't really matter. I think you've made it clear you've had a range on the casual/serious spectrum.
2014-07-11 12:05:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you done anal?
2014-07-11 12:06:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. You?
2014-07-11 12:07:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-07-11 12:08:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not the biggest fan, but every rare once in a while I get the desire to do it
2014-07-11 12:09:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? So what is the desire from?
2014-07-11 12:20:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It can feel good, and be exciting. But I guess my issues with it are more psychological  
2014-07-11 12:21:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I never would want it to happen as a surprise though
2014-07-11 12:21:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I don't think most girls are down with that.
2014-07-11 12:21:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are the psychological issues?
2014-07-11 12:23:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not ones I'd like to talk about over text lol
2014-07-11 12:24:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh ok.
2014-07-11 12:25:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I'm assuming you've gotten a facial before?
2014-07-11 12:25:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-07-11 12:26:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think that's a pretty good measure of freakiness.
2014-07-11 12:33:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]LBJ to Cleveland.
2014-07-11 13:24:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry my phone died
2014-07-11 13:25:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't really "ask" for a facial, and didn't really like it at the time 
2014-07-11 13:59:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh wow. That's pretty inconsiderate!
2014-07-11 14:01:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We don't have to do any of that stuff. It really has zero appeal to me if you're not into it. Even if you were down with it because you thought it'd make me happy, I wouldn't be into it.
2014-07-11 14:01:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha ok
2014-07-11 14:02:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm happy to just organically figure out what we like doing together 
2014-07-11 14:03:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too. Like I said, you already make me extremely satisfied, anything else would be icing on the cake.
2014-07-11 14:05:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The internet is all :Bosh to Houston
2014-07-11 14:05:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's a guarantee at this point I'd say.
2014-07-11 14:06:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They're offering him a max deal, right?
2014-07-11 14:06:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He has no reason to stay in Miami.
2014-07-11 14:10:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What have you been up to today?
2014-07-11 14:15:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm definitely rooting for the Cavs and LeBron now.
2014-07-11 14:16:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My flight has been delayed a couple of hours, but I had a two hour layover in D.C., so it might be for the best.
2014-07-11 14:19:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will you miss your layover?
2014-07-11 14:19:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so. I hope not!
2014-07-11 14:20:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fingers crossed.
2014-07-11 14:20:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The staying friends with your exes on social media thing is a really interesting development in our generation and I'd love to see some research on it.
2014-07-11 14:21:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe someone is
2014-07-11 14:21:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably.
2014-07-11 14:21:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]People might've stayed friends with exes before social media
2014-07-11 14:22:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've been to target, doing laundry, a little bit of Catching up on emails
2014-07-11 14:22:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's not the same as staying friends on social media, though.
2014-07-11 14:22:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now I'm heading to that meeting 
2014-07-11 14:23:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'll be busy for at least the next 3 hours
2014-07-11 14:23:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]K
2014-07-11 17:01:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So what time is your flight now?
2014-07-11 17:29:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]7:40.
2014-07-11 17:29:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm going to Charlotte instead of D.C. now.
2014-07-11 17:30:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Looks like people think Bosh is staying in Miami now.
2014-07-11 17:30:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was your meeting?
2014-07-11 18:08:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good, I was really late. And I'm not really going to be able to use their samples because they think all samples should be from the same year. And she thinks I need to go to canada
2014-07-11 18:09:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No fucking idea how I'm going to fit that in
2014-07-11 18:10:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Don't you have time?
2014-07-11 18:10:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All my tides are already designated really. 
2014-07-11 18:11:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or else I definitely stay a few extra days 
2014-07-11 18:12:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh ok. I guess I thought you had time at the end of July/beginning of August.
2014-07-11 18:12:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's not a low tide
2014-07-11 18:13:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh I see.
2014-07-11 18:14:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I guess you gotta do what you gotta do.
2014-07-11 18:15:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might be able to ask around and see if someone at Bamfield research station can sample for me and I go pick them up
2014-07-11 18:20:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I am going to San Diego at 2a tonight
2014-07-11 18:20:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. You leave at 2 or get there at 2?
2014-07-11 18:21:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Leave at 2
2014-07-11 18:21:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not driving though
2014-07-11 18:22:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wish you parents were there!
2014-07-11 18:23:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. That would've been convenient. So you're just coming back when you're done?
2014-07-11 18:23:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess so
2014-07-11 18:23:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kind of obnoxious, but I guess that's how field work is
2014-07-11 18:24:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm assuming you're boarding now
2014-07-11 18:24:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have a safe flight!
2014-07-11 18:25:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yep
2014-07-11 18:26:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks. Love you.
2014-07-11 18:30:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I swear to fucking god Snapchat deliberately sabotages my screenshots.
2014-07-11 18:30:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It seems like it's always the ones I really like.
2014-07-11 18:38:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha well in less than 6 days you can get an up close and personal kissy face
2014-07-11 19:21:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know this is against the spirit of Snapchat but could you just send me cute/loving pics on Hangouts?
2014-07-11 19:21:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yesss
2014-07-11 19:21:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They just fill up my memory and then I have to delete them
2014-07-11 19:21:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like just looking through pics of you sometimes and loving ones make me particularly happy.
2014-07-11 19:33:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-07-11 19:37:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I can't wait for in person kissy face. We've been sitting in our plane right outside our gate for 15 minutes and this kid behind me is losing his shit.
2014-07-11 19:46:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send me a pic
2014-07-11 19:46:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of you, not the screaming kid :)
2014-07-11 20:14:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You look sleepy my dear
2014-07-11 20:14:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I like how I look in that pic... that never happens!
2014-07-11 20:15:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I feel kinda tired, but I got a decent amount of sleep last night.
2014-07-11 20:15:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bet you wish it was just a snapchat haha
2014-07-11 20:15:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But seriously you look fine
2014-07-11 20:15:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And handsome
2014-07-11 20:16:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you got love goggles on ;)
2014-07-11 20:16:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you always have love goggles on
2014-07-11 20:17:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha maybe.
2014-07-11 20:18:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was actually thinking earlier that I think our sex/relationship history conversations might have emotionally drained me a bit, so I wonder if that's what's making me tired?
2014-07-11 20:18:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'd be interesting!
2014-07-11 20:18:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They were draining for me too
2014-07-11 20:21:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was one of the rare times where you weren't energizing me.
2014-07-11 20:22:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our horoscope did warn us about overstimulation haha
2014-07-11 20:27:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A friends status on Facebook: "Comes to Miami, parties for 4 years, leaves...somebody get Lebron a UM diploma"
2014-07-11 20:28:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice. He actually said Miami was like college for him in the letter.
2014-07-11 20:28:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So y'all want to college together! Haha
2014-07-11 20:29:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wooooo
2014-07-11 20:30:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Apparently, the Bulls are back in the hunt for Melo.
2014-07-11 20:30:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want that to happen so bad.
2014-07-11 20:33:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to be lying with my head on you.
2014-07-11 20:34:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With some head rubs?
2014-07-11 20:34:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely.
2014-07-11 20:36:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd like that too
2014-07-11 20:36:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's somehow very calming for me
2014-07-11 20:37:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? That's pretty cool.
2014-07-11 20:39:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if other monkeys/apes get calm while grooming other monkeys/apes?
2014-07-11 20:39:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe it runs deep!
2014-07-11 20:40:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably only the monkeys and apes they really love
2014-07-11 20:41:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww
2014-07-11 20:41:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've thought about the first hug I'm going to give you when I see you several times.
2014-07-11 20:42:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought about that a lot before the last time you picked me up
2014-07-11 20:42:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like, "what will I do with my backpack"
2014-07-11 20:43:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha that's pretty adorable
2014-07-11 20:43:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Should I try not to run to him, cause that'll look desperate, even though I know I'll really want to run"
2014-07-11 20:43:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not desperate, but maybe a little over eager 
2014-07-11 20:43:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww
2014-07-11 20:43:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You seem to be very aware of the over eagerness
2014-07-11 20:44:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or at least you were
2014-07-11 20:44:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we're probably (hopefully?) past that now.
2014-07-11 20:47:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It seems like your brain was trying to keep your heart under control... to get metaphorical.
2014-07-11 20:47:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah perhaps 
2014-07-11 20:48:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we are past that
2014-07-11 20:48:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You seem to be pretty hard to scare off from me
2014-07-11 20:49:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah... I would say your eagerness has had the opposite effect in that regard.
2014-07-11 20:50:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually noticed how sometimes the things you would say when like we were having serious conversations about us would seem to betray the things you'd say just sort of in the moment and how you acted when we were together.
2014-07-11 20:51:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like I remember you saying early on you didn't want to worry about labels... and then pretty shortly after you were calling me your boyfriend on the reg... haha
2014-07-11 20:52:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Same sort of deal with you telling me you loved me.
2014-07-11 20:53:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You had made comments about the pace of things or something, and then that happened!
2014-07-11 20:53:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you kept making me think things were going to develop much slower, and then you were always the one speeding things up haha
2014-07-11 20:56:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm, part of that may have also been me still figuring out my feelings
2014-07-11 20:57:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They were developing quickly, and I wanted to make sure they weren't superficial 
2014-07-11 20:59:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That makes sense.
2014-07-11 21:07:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You think you're still figuring things out?
2014-07-11 21:07:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Michael!
2014-07-11 21:07:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No more defending our relationship or feelings to each other, remember?
2014-07-11 21:08:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha I wasn't implying that!
2014-07-11 21:08:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know you love me.
2014-07-11 21:12:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well that question and this topic sort if fall into the same category of going over every detail of how and why we fell in love and my feelings during that process
2014-07-11 21:12:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK, convo over.
2014-07-11 21:12:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My bad!
2014-07-11 21:13:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha it's ok, those conversations are just really draining for me for some reason 
2014-07-11 21:14:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's OK. Just let me know when I'm getting on them and I'll stop. I don't even realize I'm doing it.
2014-07-11 21:16:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. About to head to Cincinnati. Love you. Sorry I get on these dumb topics!
2014-07-11 21:17:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you honey, no need to apologize! I know you do it because you're legitimately interested in me and my thoughts and feelings and that's pretty fucking awesome 
2014-07-11 21:18:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just not always able to keep up with the sharing overload. One day we can talk about it when I feel up to it
2014-07-11 21:18:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have a safe flight, enjoy spending time with your family!
2014-07-11 21:18:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘😘😘😘😘😘
2014-07-11 23:19:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So what are you doing until 2?
2014-07-11 23:20:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Buying some supplies. Eating some in n out
2014-07-11 23:21:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And going to try to sleep from 10p-1
2014-07-11 23:22:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. I was wondering if you were gonna try to sleep or not.
2014-07-11 23:26:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was the flight?
2014-07-11 23:26:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is someone picking you up?
2014-07-11 23:27:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Uneventful. I'm in the hotel.
2014-07-11 23:27:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Room to yourself?
2014-07-11 23:28:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm staying in a room with my parents on a little roll out bed haha.
2014-07-11 23:28:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My dad says it's a heavenly mattress, though haha
2014-07-11 23:30:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess my bro and his fam went to sleep at 9, so I still haven't seen anyone except my parents.
2014-07-11 23:30:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha it's kind of funny imagining 26 yr old you sleeping on a cot with your parents
2014-07-11 23:31:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah, it's pretty goofy.
2014-07-11 23:32:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought about what I'm gonna do to you this Thursday on the flight ;)
2014-07-11 23:36:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah?
2014-07-11 23:36:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah.
2014-07-11 23:42:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're not gonna give me any details?
2014-07-11 23:44:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha hmm. Well I'm thinking I want to really build your anticipation.
2014-07-11 23:45:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to start you off with a back rub and get you feeling really good and relaxed.
2014-07-11 23:45:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And then I was thinking I'd start kissing your neck and work my way down your back.
2014-07-11 23:46:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe nibble your ass a bit before kissing the inside of your thigh.
2014-07-11 23:48:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Then I want to turn you over and suck your tits a bit before working my way down to your pussy.
2014-07-11 23:48:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I'm thinking I'll eat you out really slow for a bit, get you aching for my cock.
2014-07-11 23:49:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And then I'll move up on top of you and push the head of my penis right up against your pussy.
2014-07-11 23:50:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And slowly move inside of you, but not deep
2014-07-11 23:50:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This sounds like torture
2014-07-11 23:50:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And slowly move in and out like that.
2014-07-11 23:51:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very exquisite torture 
2014-07-11 23:51:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And make you beg for it
2014-07-11 23:52:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Until I finally give you one really slow thrust going as deep as I can inside you.
2014-07-11 23:52:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And then going from there :)
2014-07-11 23:56:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just that description guy me wet 
2014-07-11 23:56:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-07-11 23:57:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like to requires a lot if self control on your part
2014-07-11 23:57:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Indeed.
2014-07-11 23:58:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's part of the fun ;)
2014-07-12 00:01:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well, sugar. I'm gonna get to sleep. Can't wait to taste you ;) Sweet dreams.
2014-07-12 00:03:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You sure know how to drive a girl crazy. I might not be able to go to sleep after all 
2014-07-12 00:03:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight my sex god
2014-07-12 04:29:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Soooo sleepy
2014-07-12 07:51:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's on the schedule for the day?
2014-07-12 07:55:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Zoo things I guess!
2014-07-12 07:55:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you all finished?
2014-07-12 07:56:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In looking forward to the day when you get to come home to me in bed after an early morning in the field.
2014-07-12 07:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*I'm
2014-07-12 07:59:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're driving back now, so another ~1.5 hrs of riding and 45 min of driving, then I can sleep 
2014-07-12 07:59:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh that sounds so perfect!
2014-07-12 08:13:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we're gonna make a good team :)
2014-07-12 08:13:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we're already a good team.
2014-07-12 08:14:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was the late night field session?
2014-07-12 08:15:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You didn't check in!
2014-07-12 08:20:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we will definitely make a good team :) 
2014-07-12 08:21:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ahhhh
2014-07-12 08:23:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I managed to, thanks for reminding me haha
2014-07-12 08:24:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't get as many oysters as I wanted
2014-07-12 08:25:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And some of the ones I got I think might be Pacifics
2014-07-12 08:25:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But they're gonna be back here again this summer and said they'd look for me
2014-07-12 08:26:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's cool.
2014-07-12 08:29:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will you get to pet a rhino?
2014-07-12 08:34:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think so! I might get a kiss from a camel too!
2014-07-12 08:36:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obvs take lots if pics 
2014-07-12 08:36:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm not sure how I feel about you getting kisses from ladies other than me
2014-07-12 08:37:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP];)
2014-07-12 09:04:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's the baby?
2014-07-12 09:09:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just saw him. He's sleeping and being cute. Charlotte still love me. She's holding my hand :)
2014-07-12 09:10:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:D
2014-07-12 09:11:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like that you seem to be good with kids, and enjoy being around them 
2014-07-12 09:11:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's sweet
2014-07-12 09:18:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) I love you
2014-07-12 10:57:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's crazy that it would ever be adaptive to lose the ability to fly.
2014-07-12 13:51:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lot of fans of Jesus at the Cincinnati Zoo!
2014-07-12 15:36:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha 
2014-07-12 15:36:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Man oh man I can't stop sleeping
2014-07-12 15:59:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha good, I need you rested up when you visit ;)
2014-07-12 16:07:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't count on that, looks like I'll be doing this crack of dawn tide thing at least 3 more times before I see you
2014-07-12 16:08:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, damn dude. That's rough!
2014-07-12 16:08:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But one good night of naked cuddling and I'll probably be powered up again :)
2014-07-12 16:09:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a good thing these minus tides only really happen in the summer 
2014-07-12 16:11:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I can handle that
2014-07-12 16:11:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because it'd just be tough to do during the school year?
2014-07-12 16:49:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, or just tough to do often I guess
2014-07-12 16:49:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I talked to my mom, and she asked about smoking pot
2014-07-12 16:50:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She said "it never occurred to her that I would even consider doing it because I'm such a happy, bubbly person and only depressed fiends smoke pot"
2014-07-12 17:01:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wow. If she only knew!
2014-07-12 17:01:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I know
2014-07-12 17:02:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did tell her I smoke occasionally though
2014-07-12 17:03:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How'd she feel about that?
2014-07-12 17:04:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I dunno, surprised. But I said it was a safer/healthier way to relax every once in a while then alcohol and she didn't argue against that
2014-07-12 17:05:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's cool.
2014-07-12 17:05:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why'd she ask?
2014-07-12 17:06:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause she saw recreational pot sales started in WA while I was there
2014-07-12 17:06:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK.
2014-07-12 17:08:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would like to see a study on marijuana use and personality types.
2014-07-12 17:11:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, weed definitely numbs people too.
2014-07-12 17:12:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dulls the brain, perhaps but not your senses 
2014-07-12 17:12:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Food tastes better, visual stimulation is heightened
2014-07-12 17:12:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Physical stimulation is heightened 
2014-07-12 17:12:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Right, but I was referring to your criticism of heroin.
2014-07-12 17:13:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know
2014-07-12 17:15:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we should just table the heroine discussion. Neither of us are going to change our opinions on the subject (though I do feel my opinion is slightly more supported in literature and surveys and your opinion rests on one survey that I still take issue with)
2014-07-12 17:15:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if the chance ever comes up, I'll sit with you while you try it to make sure you don't choke on your vomit :)
2014-07-12 17:17:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]K. Yeah wasn't really trying to bring it back up. Just pointing out an inconsistency ;)
2014-07-12 17:20:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't see that inconsistency, even if they can be "abused" for psychological issues in the same way, pot won't kill you.
2014-07-12 17:22:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You asked something like "Why would a person want to numb themselves" or something like that.
2014-07-12 17:23:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You were implying the feeling it produced didn't have value.
2014-07-12 17:23:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it's whatever. Let's drop it.
2014-07-12 17:24:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I think we both like having the last word a little bit
2014-07-12 17:24:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'll let you have it this time :)
2014-07-12 17:24:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You can have the list word.
2014-07-12 17:25:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think all drugs can be bad and can be used responsibly. I think they effect different people differently.
2014-07-12 17:25:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's my universal opinion on drugs.
2014-07-12 17:25:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*affect
2014-07-12 17:27:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think there are qualitative and quantitative differences in "bad" and the distribution of people who can use different drugs responsibly 
2014-07-12 17:28:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think people enjoy being fucked up and should be able to get fucked up safely by having legal access to well-regulated drugs.
2014-07-12 17:28:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And honestly and scientifically educated about their effects.
2014-07-12 17:28:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool
2014-07-12 17:28:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying to work so I'll talk to you later
2014-07-12 17:29:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you
2014-07-12 20:14:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There's a pretty cool free concert going on in the square across from our hotel. It's like seven electronic/hip-hop acts over four hours. Wish you were here. I think we'd have fun.
2014-07-12 20:15:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, happy four month mensiversary!
2014-07-12 20:15:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is your family enjoying in?
2014-07-12 20:15:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's been an amazing four months.
2014-07-12 20:16:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't believe it's only been 4 months!
2014-07-12 20:16:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Eh. I was with my mom on the outskirts. I didn't really want to go H.A.M. haha.
2014-07-12 20:18:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know! I feel like we've gotten to know each other so much in that time that our actual "relationship age" is older. Like it's dog years haha
2014-07-12 20:23:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But at the same time, it definitely feels like I haven't spent that much time with you in person.
2014-07-12 20:24:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's because we haven't, but August will help with that I hope! And we should pick a good time soon for me to visit in sept
2014-07-12 20:29:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm freaking out a little about this project
2014-07-12 20:29:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I wasted valuable tide time because I didn't have my shit together and was depending too much on getting samples from other people
2014-07-12 20:30:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh no :(
2014-07-12 20:30:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is visiting me a bad idea?
2014-07-12 20:31:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, there are no tides then
2014-07-12 20:31:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm emailing some people like crazy now about possibly collecting for me.
2014-07-12 20:32:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well hopefully they can help you out. Like how much are you missing?
2014-07-12 20:32:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which is what I should've done in the first place, now I seem desist are and unorganized
2014-07-12 20:33:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need more in WA (in fact I could've collected while at Friday Harbor). And from at least 2 places in Canada
2014-07-12 20:33:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And some places need boats
2014-07-12 20:34:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see. Well I'm sure people will be able to help you out.
2014-07-12 20:36:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I would say not to worry about it TOO much. First field seasons are typically learning experiences I think. And it's not like you've been screwing around.
2014-07-12 20:37:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the worst case scenario is that it might just be kinda a drag to not have a bunch of data to work with during the school year.
2014-07-12 20:37:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, if I don't collect from all these sites before next summer, then the whole project is compromised
2014-07-12 20:38:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where as is if do collect, then I definitely have a bonafide paper in 1.5 years
2014-07-12 20:38:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That might be a tad dramatic
2014-07-12 20:40:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So you were expecting to get samples from these sites you mentioned, but they feel through?
2014-07-12 20:43:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's hypothetically a lot of variability within populations among years, and maybe even in the level of connectivity between pops- confounded by harvesting pressures. Because their samples are from 5+ years ago, throwing them in with samples from 2014 might make them seem more differentiated than they actually would be if all from the same cohort
2014-07-12 20:44:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Once I get samples from all the same locations, we can also start to do temporal comparisons to see if this hypothesis is true 
2014-07-12 20:46:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Couldn't you test that first part first?
2014-07-12 20:47:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And what, realize "oh shit, I do need samples from the same year, except now it's 2015"
2014-07-12 20:47:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry that was sassier than I meant
2014-07-12 20:47:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To test, I need to sequence and it's cheaper to sequence everything in one go
2014-07-12 20:49:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are samples from five years ago different from 2014.
2014-07-12 20:49:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll explain in person or on the phone sometime 
2014-07-12 20:50:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok.
2014-07-12 20:50:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just extra looking forward to some me and you time to calm me down
2014-07-12 20:51:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok. Well we don't have to talk science at all while you're visiting if it's gonna stress you out!
2014-07-12 20:53:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pau Gasol to the Bulls after the Melo tease is such a fucking letdown. It's like expecting a PS4 for Christmas and getting socks.
2014-07-12 21:10:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Send me a snap, sugar.
2014-07-12 21:22:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, honey. It's gonna be okay.
2014-07-12 21:27:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hate not being able to be there for you :(
2014-07-12 21:34:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll be ok, it'll all work out
2014-07-12 21:35:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you going back to San Diego or are you done with that site?
2014-07-12 21:38:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're gonna collect a few more for me there, but I'm going to a site near LA tomorrow morning, then staying with my cousin in the Bay Area Sunday night to wed morning to collect a bunch of sites around there
2014-07-12 21:38:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So no I won't be back in San Diego to collect
2014-07-12 21:39:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok.
2014-07-12 21:42:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have my phone set up to automatically save snaps now. So snap away haha
2014-07-12 21:47:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd you do that??
2014-07-12 21:48:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A little hackery. It doesn't even let you know! Very sneaky.
2014-07-12 21:53:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pretty sure you could get me to do anything with that pouty face.
2014-07-12 22:03:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My clever computer scientist :)
2014-07-12 22:09:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'll try to use discretion when pulling out that face then haha
2014-07-12 23:09:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dissected all the oysters from last night, and now I'm meeting an ots friend for drinks!
2014-07-12 23:09:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight love, talk to you tomorrow 
2014-07-13 06:40:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck this shit
2014-07-13 06:41:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I want to be a professional foodie instead
2014-07-13 08:04:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I'm sure you're not alone in that.
2014-07-13 08:07:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you.
2014-07-13 08:09:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks for the snaps too :)
2014-07-13 08:09:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That second one definitely got me excited.
2014-07-13 08:11:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Your mouth looks really sexy in it.
2014-07-13 08:12:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I realllly want to suck your titties now.
2014-07-13 08:51:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty sure you like waders and identifying shellfish species.
2014-07-13 08:52:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Those are the parts of biology I actually like.
2014-07-13 11:15:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'm glad you liked it, I might've been slightly tipsy for it 
2014-07-13 11:17:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my tits are definitely craving some attention 
2014-07-13 11:24:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I guess I like those things, but not before the sun comes up
2014-07-13 11:29:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Understandable!
2014-07-13 11:29:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I had a feeling your inhibitions might've been a little lowered.
2014-07-13 11:30:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I haven't had a orgasm in a realllllly long time
2014-07-13 11:30:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've got a little pent up sexual energy
2014-07-13 11:31:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But, as I've said before, it's a huge turn on that that's where your mind goes when you're inhibitions are lowered.
2014-07-13 11:31:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-07-13 11:32:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was wondering if you got any release at the time of that picture.
2014-07-13 11:33:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, I think I'm going to wait for the pro
2014-07-13 11:33:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-07-13 11:34:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-07-13 11:35:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm probably better at giving you orgasms than anything else I do, lol.
2014-07-13 11:35:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're clearly pretty good at your job
2014-07-13 11:35:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the skills associated with that
2014-07-13 11:36:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The job of giving you orgasms? ;)
2014-07-13 11:36:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha if it's a job, I'm definitely not paying you enough
2014-07-13 11:36:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I do think I'm pretty good at my job, but I get the impression I'm an elite Katie orgasm provider.
2014-07-13 11:37:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like the LBJ of Katie orgasms.
2014-07-13 11:38:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just don't do any of that free agent bullshit
2014-07-13 11:38:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Get too cocky about your abilities and try to take them on the road 
2014-07-13 11:41:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha OK. I'm pretty sure I'm too dependent on you for my ego at this point ;)
2014-07-13 11:41:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"What? You don't worship me as your sex god? What's wrong with you?"
2014-07-13 11:42:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha just as long as that's not the only reason you stay with me ;)
2014-07-13 11:43:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Only one of billions.
2014-07-13 11:43:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-07-13 11:43:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the orgasms are only 1/1000000000 of that too
2014-07-13 11:45:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D I love you so much. I can't wait to see you!!!
2014-07-13 11:46:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish zoos provided entire taxonomies for all of the animals.
2014-07-13 11:46:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or at least order and family.
2014-07-13 11:47:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like it would be good for educating people on evolution too.
2014-07-13 11:48:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or a simple phylogeny of where they fit on the tree of life
2014-07-13 11:48:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aka verts are only a small part
2014-07-13 11:48:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha such a vert hater ;)
2014-07-13 11:49:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But, for example, at the bear cat exhibit, the little placard said it's neither a bear nor a cat.
2014-07-13 11:50:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But WTF does that mean outside of evolution and some sort of hierarchical understanding of relationships.
2014-07-13 11:51:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Men
2014-07-13 11:51:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha sorry mistype 
2014-07-13 11:52:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What is a bearcat then, does it tell you? Like what it's related too?
2014-07-13 11:53:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it said it was a civet.
2014-07-13 11:53:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But even then, it'd be nice to see how removed it is from bears and cats.
2014-07-13 11:54:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Agreed
2014-07-13 11:55:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You could maybe have like a phylogeny of carnivores pointing out bears, cats, and Bearcats, and maybe some other groups of interest.
2014-07-13 11:59:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And being able to transition from sexy talk to bettering zoo educational policy is just one more of the billions of reasons I love you :)
2014-07-13 12:00:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only 4 more nights
2014-07-13 12:00:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When's your flight today?
2014-07-13 12:01:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]7:30 with a layover in D.C. I get to Raleigh around midnight.
2014-07-13 12:06:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you just parked there I guess?
2014-07-13 12:07:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. Did park and ride. $6 a day.
2014-07-13 12:08:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might give you a call when I'm in D.C.
2014-07-13 12:08:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What time would that be?
2014-07-13 12:10:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Uhh I guess around 9 EST
2014-07-13 12:10:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might be having dinner with my cousin, but more likely will still be driving 
2014-07-13 12:11:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If the latter, then yes!
2014-07-13 12:11:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok well I'll give it a shot then.
2014-07-13 12:39:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My cousin texted me last night and said I can probably stay with him he just has to ask the roomies
2014-07-13 12:51:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet.
2014-07-13 12:51:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What was the alternative? Haha
2014-07-13 12:56:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Camp? Haha I had none
2014-07-13 12:57:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. Well that's not really a bad alternative I suppose.
2014-07-13 12:58:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like thinking about you using my tent :)
2014-07-13 12:58:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can't wait to spend the night with you in it someday!
2014-07-13 12:59:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That someday is only 5 weeks away!
2014-07-13 13:00:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh are we camping in Montana?
2014-07-13 13:01:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I assume at least one night?
2014-07-13 13:01:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno I guess we should start planning that soon
2014-07-13 13:03:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-07-13 13:51:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Scheduled my shuttle! 6:15a on Thursday... I should be a pro getting up that early by then!
2014-07-13 13:54:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweeeet. So excited!
2014-07-13 14:26:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://wetnwildgenes.wordpress.com
2014-07-13 14:26:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]my blog
2014-07-13 15:10:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awesome! Do you think you should start another one that uses the name in the URL?
2014-07-13 15:11:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Especially since there's only one post.
2014-07-13 15:11:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhh I guess
2014-07-13 15:12:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha sooo difficult.
2014-07-13 16:18:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Left fit SF, I'll definitely still be driving so call me
2014-07-13 16:33:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok, sugar.

2014-07-13 17:49:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Babies going through tunnels for the first time.
2014-07-13 20:26:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You keep dropping out I think.
2014-07-13 21:41:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Flight was delayed on the taxi out!
2014-07-13 21:41:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Heading back to the gate.
2014-07-13 21:47:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh no 
2014-07-13 21:50:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess one of the thrusters was having issues.
2014-07-13 21:51:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This dude next to me is not covering his mouth when he coughs and it's really starting to get on my nerves.
2014-07-13 21:52:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He also crossed his leg at point so his shoeless foot was all up in my space. Like WTF, man.
2014-07-13 23:18:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you make it out??
2014-07-14 00:36:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Back home.
2014-07-14 00:37:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I'm sorry it's so late
2014-07-14 00:37:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you strangle that dude?
2014-07-14 00:39:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha no. Fell asleep on the plane.
2014-07-14 00:40:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably the less confrontational choice!
2014-07-14 00:41:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You in San Francisco?
2014-07-14 00:49:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am!
2014-07-14 00:49:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]coool
2014-07-14 01:27:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did I mention that I love you? I'm falling asleep with the biggest smile on my face just from a conversation where we didn't even speak. You've got me hooked: body, mind, and soul (whatever that may be)
2014-07-14 01:31:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D the feeling couldn't be more mutual. I'm so excited about all of the love and adventure we're going to get to share together (with the next batch coming on Thursday!)
2014-07-14 01:31:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm so thankful for you. You're the perfect person to explore the universe with.
2014-07-14 01:32:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much. Sweet dreams.
2014-07-14 01:34:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet dreams, my perfect match, the yin to my yang, the dorsal shell to my ventral
2014-07-14 01:34:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘😘😘😘
2014-07-14 09:00:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sooo beautiful.
2014-07-14 12:19:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Should I cut my hair?
2014-07-14 12:39:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have no string opinion one way or another
2014-07-14 12:40:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm a little curious what it looks/feels like as it is now
2014-07-14 12:47:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool. I guess I'll just trim my beard then!
2014-07-14 13:32:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If there was something superficial you'd prefer with my appearance, would you tell me?
2014-07-14 13:33:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yes. e.g. I like your hair as long as it is now.
2014-07-14 14:15:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is that okay?
2014-07-14 14:15:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yes!
2014-07-14 14:16:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You like it even when it becomes a rat nest though?
2014-07-14 14:18:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah. The messier the better ;)
2014-07-14 14:18:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But for real I'm really into your hair.
2014-07-14 14:21:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright I'll hold off on the "cutting it all off" whim
2014-07-14 14:22:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I guess you're usually the one that makes it so messy, so if you don't mind I won't worry about it :)
2014-07-14 14:24:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha true! And I appreciate you holding off, but if you ever really want to cut it all off you should go for it. I'll still think you're just as beautiful/sexy, I'll just miss it.
2014-07-14 14:25:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'd miss it too
2014-07-14 14:25:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the grow back would require some really awkward looks
2014-07-14 14:27:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Straight haired people just don't understand!
2014-07-14 14:30:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-07-14 15:37:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're we gonna do for food on Thursday?
2014-07-14 15:50:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My dick + your pussy
2014-07-14 15:50:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But whatever you want.
2014-07-14 15:57:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well after that then
2014-07-14 15:58:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Seconds? Thirds?
2014-07-14 15:58:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe having some options to choose from before hand will help avoid hangry Katie 
2014-07-14 15:58:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thirds most definitely 
2014-07-14 15:58:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well what do you want?
2014-07-14 15:59:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't knowww
2014-07-14 15:59:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You want fast food or do you want something better?
2014-07-14 15:59:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want something relatively quick, but not fast food
2014-07-14 15:59:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've eaten a little too much lately 
2014-07-14 16:00:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or we can have stuff stocked up for cooking like tacos
2014-07-14 16:00:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok. Well I'm not 100% sure what fits into that category.
2014-07-14 16:00:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do some research!
2014-07-14 16:00:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Take out?
2014-07-14 16:05:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sure! So what'cha, what'cha, what'cha want?
2014-07-14 16:06:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What are my optionssss
2014-07-14 16:06:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Japanese food/sushi? Pizza?
2014-07-14 16:08:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Whatever turns you on ;)
2014-07-14 16:09:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I think we can probably find anything you want.
2014-07-14 16:55:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ten hour days are too longggg
2014-07-14 17:03:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How much longer do you have?
2014-07-14 17:05:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]55 mins.
2014-07-14 17:05:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha aww, did you have new work to do today?
2014-07-14 17:06:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, so that's good at least.
2014-07-14 17:06:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually have a mini training session to a marketing person today.
2014-07-14 17:07:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You already did it? That's pretty neat
2014-07-14 17:07:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah *gave
2014-07-14 17:09:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd it go?
2014-07-14 17:11:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had fun. It might've been a little much for him, but he made it sound like it was exactly the type of analysis he wanted to do.
2014-07-14 17:11:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I told him I'd help him out with whatever too, so hopefully GE doesn't feel overwhelmed.
2014-07-14 17:12:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]GE?
2014-07-14 17:12:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I sent him an email with a bunch of resources, so he should be able to get started a bit at least.
2014-07-14 17:12:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*he
2014-07-14 17:12:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you made a user interface, right?
2014-07-14 17:12:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's a weird autocorrect. How does GE have a higher probability than he?
2014-07-14 17:13:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well this isn't exactly what I was doing.
2014-07-14 17:13:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This is some stuff I was experimenting with towards the beginning, but that's more relevant to what he's doing.
2014-07-14 17:14:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I see 
2014-07-14 17:14:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I talked to you about market basket analysis, right?
2014-07-14 17:14:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think so 
2014-07-14 17:14:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Breifly  
2014-07-14 17:15:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's more what he's doing.
2014-07-14 17:15:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're so goofy
2014-07-14 17:15:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You like it
2014-07-14 17:17:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Love it :)
2014-07-14 17:19:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fucking TWO different times people were giving away their home run derby tickets today and both times they were gone by the time I got there.
2014-07-14 17:19:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Home run derby?
2014-07-14 17:20:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. Did I not tell you about that?
2014-07-14 17:21:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When is it?
2014-07-14 17:21:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The Triple-A minor league all-star game is in Durham.
2014-07-14 17:21:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Red Hat gave away 175 tickets to the home run derby tonight and 175 to the all-star game tomorrow night last week.
2014-07-14 17:22:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I went to pick one up 15 minutes after the email was sent out and ALL of them were already gone.
2014-07-14 17:22:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You snooze you lose
2014-07-14 17:23:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😈
2014-07-14 18:41:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Being a tourist alone is fun for like an hour or so, and then it gets a little lonely 
2014-07-14 18:45:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I guess I'm used to it at this point. I definitely would prefer doing touristy things with you, though.
2014-07-14 18:47:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish I was at that museum with you. It looks pretty cool.
2014-07-14 18:48:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was really neat! That's what made me think of you, there were some like 80 year old 2 person games 
2014-07-14 18:50:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We'll make it there together someday.
2014-07-14 18:51:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Put it on the list!
2014-07-14 18:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"If you're blue and you don't know where to go to Why don't you go where fashion sits,  "
2014-07-14 18:56:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-07-14 18:57:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get a little excited when I've seen you edited our list
2014-07-14 18:57:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Same here
2014-07-14 18:58:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's me know you were thinking if me 
2014-07-14 18:59:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're like ridiculously compatible
2014-07-14 19:15:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What if you're just a mean trick like what happened to the little dude in GoT
2014-07-14 19:16:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who dislikes you enough to play such a trick?
2014-07-14 19:17:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha good point.
2014-07-14 19:41:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just walked 1.5 miles back to the house
2014-07-14 19:41:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's chilly here!
2014-07-14 19:42:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna take a nap before ppl get back from work and I have to be social 
2014-07-14 19:42:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh also, I thought about how I want to get engaged the whole way home hahaha
2014-07-14 19:43:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahahaha
2014-07-14 19:43:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well shit
2014-07-14 19:43:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like the setting and whatever?
2014-07-14 19:43:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not necesssarilyyyy with you ;)
2014-07-14 19:44:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:*(
2014-07-14 19:44:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just thinking more about the concept of a ring just for one person, and how maybe it could be more of a collaborative thing
2014-07-14 19:45:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not just waiting around for the guy to "surprise" me 
2014-07-14 19:46:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how would it work then?
2014-07-14 19:46:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]someone has to ask someone at some point, right?
2014-07-14 19:47:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can talk about it another, maybe more relevant time lol
2014-07-14 19:47:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just thought it was funny that that was on my mind at all
2014-07-14 19:48:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha now I get to think about another guy proposing to you
2014-07-14 19:48:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as long as you end up happy I guess
2014-07-14 19:48:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-07-14 19:48:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Michael!
2014-07-14 19:49:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're so silly 
2014-07-14 19:54:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've actually thought about how I'd propose to you
2014-07-14 19:54:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-07-14 19:54:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah?
2014-07-14 19:55:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep    😃 
2014-07-14 19:55:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't spoil it!
2014-07-14 19:55:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha well you don't even want it    😉 
2014-07-14 19:56:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I was thinking, if we both knew we wanted to get married to each other then we could each plan like a surprise/gift/sweet thing to say for the other person.
2014-07-14 19:57:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But maybe that's too weird?
2014-07-14 19:57:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it's weird
2014-07-14 19:57:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think there's only one element of surprise, though
2014-07-14 19:57:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it wouldn't be a surprise 
2014-07-14 19:57:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what wouldn't?
2014-07-14 19:59:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That I was being asked to marry someone. At this hypothetical point, I'm sure we'll have already talked about marriage and started making plans to spend the rest of our lives together. The surprise would just be the when/where of the asking
2014-07-14 20:00:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well... that's still like a big moment
2014-07-14 20:00:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]most people talk about getting married before the proposal
2014-07-14 20:00:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's still a big deal
2014-07-14 20:01:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's whatever, I already know I'm gonna marry you
2014-07-14 20:01:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna propose to you
2014-07-14 20:01:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're gonna love
2014-07-14 20:01:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it
2014-07-14 20:01:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're gonna cry
2014-07-14 20:01:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're gonna live happily ever after
2014-07-14 20:01:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is this how you were planning it, over Hangouts?
2014-07-14 20:01:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-07-14 20:02:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I am about to tear up haha
2014-07-14 20:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]💎 
2014-07-14 20:02:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha are you for real?
2014-07-14 20:02:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe
2014-07-14 20:02:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm also dead tired 
2014-07-14 20:02:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw
2014-07-14 20:02:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aka the nap I said I wanted to take
2014-07-14 20:03:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well get on it girl
2014-07-14 20:03:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you can't expect me to not get all excited when bringing up the prospects of marrying you
2014-07-14 20:07:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok ok you're right 
2014-07-14 20:07:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's dial back the marriage talk a little bit, at least when we aren't in person
2014-07-14 20:07:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha freaking you out?
2014-07-14 21:45:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol at that girl letting her brother feel her up
2014-07-14 22:18:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's a badass
2014-07-14 22:18:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yeah that part is weird
2014-07-15 01:38:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Getting up at 6a tomorrow! :/
2014-07-15 01:38:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you my dear
2014-07-15 12:56:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey babe
2014-07-15 12:58:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey, honey.
2014-07-15 13:07:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The prospect of that massage on Thursday afternoon is all that's getting me through today
2014-07-15 13:53:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, rough morning?
2014-07-15 14:09:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just longgg
2014-07-15 14:11:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Well just a little over 48 hours now and I promise you'll be feeling good :)
2014-07-15 14:12:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Odds on you falling asleep during the message?
2014-07-15 14:16:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure you can find a way to prevent that ;)
2014-07-15 14:20:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://youtu.be/wbUpGoOjFWw
2014-07-15 14:41:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha someone seems to be getting a little excited 
2014-07-15 14:41:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who am I kidding, both of us are pretty excited
2014-07-15 14:42:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Meh
2014-07-15 14:43:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]?!!!
2014-07-15 14:43:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-07-15 14:43:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Obviously can't wait.
2014-07-15 14:47:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I sleep on the plane, I might be more awake than you
2014-07-15 14:47:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What with the time change too
2014-07-15 14:47:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol
2014-07-15 14:48:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you stay up later than me sometimes.
2014-07-15 14:48:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it's more because you can't sleep, not because you're not tired.
2014-07-15 14:50:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But my body has been on a 3 hour time difference for a few weeks now, even if I keep weird hours
2014-07-15 14:50:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's work today?
2014-07-15 14:51:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. Well I'm definitely ok with you wanting to stay up for whatever mysterious reason ;)
2014-07-15 14:52:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's good. I just had a meeting with one of the sales guys.
2014-07-15 14:52:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]About how we can start integrating my stuff into their strategies.
2014-07-15 14:53:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still got 3 hours left, though :+
2014-07-15 14:53:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:(
2014-07-15 14:56:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How did you not even comment on my snaps yesterday?!
2014-07-15 14:57:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Awww, if working that long is totally miserable, you don't have to do it just for an extra 30 min/hour with me
2014-07-15 14:58:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I actually opened them while hanging out with my cousin so didn't really get to appreciate them
2014-07-15 14:58:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should warn me when I'm not alone!
2014-07-15 14:59:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. I thought you'd for sure get a kick out of the first one.
2014-07-15 15:01:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The butt one? I did!
2014-07-15 15:02:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would've screenshot it for sure
2014-07-15 15:04:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha oh ok. Well that's good.
2014-07-15 15:04:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you get a boner pretty much every day?
2014-07-15 15:06:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-07-15 15:07:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-07-15 15:09:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]  http://forum.bodybuilding.com/showthread.php?t=116607591
2014-07-15 15:09:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Looks like you might only have a few more years of that hahaha
2014-07-15 15:10:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though maybe having a naked Katie in your bed every morning would help....
2014-07-15 15:13:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You gonna be okay with not getting some five times a day?
2014-07-15 15:14:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe ween me off slowly, go down to 3 times/day for a few years 
2014-07-15 15:15:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha but below 3 is simply not acceptable.
2014-07-15 15:15:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'll be difficult, but I'll manage
2014-07-15 15:16:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think you'll still masterbate every once in a while when we live together?
2014-07-15 15:18:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt it. I guess it depends on you.
2014-07-15 15:18:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you think you will?
2014-07-15 15:18:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On how often I want to have sex?
2014-07-15 15:19:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-07-15 15:19:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought we talked about how I wouldn't want to be the only one initiating
2014-07-15 15:20:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok well how often we have sex then.
2014-07-15 15:21:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd say if we're hitting around three days a week I probably wouldn't have the desire to.
2014-07-15 15:21:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]At my current libido
2014-07-15 15:22:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What about you?
2014-07-15 15:23:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I probably wouldn't, certainly not at that rate
2014-07-15 15:23:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-07-15 15:23:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I would miss my vibrator every once in a while ;)
2014-07-15 15:24:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, yeah?
2014-07-15 15:25:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you ever want to use a sex toy in bed with me?
2014-07-15 15:27:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm down with you using your vibrator, if that's what you're asking.
2014-07-15 15:27:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I meant you using it on me
2014-07-15 15:28:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or like a vibrating cock ring or something like that lol
2014-07-15 15:28:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha sure, if you're into that!
2014-07-15 15:29:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know I've never done it
2014-07-15 15:29:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, well yeah. I'm definitely down with trying it out.
2014-07-15 15:30:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've been involved with vibrators in sex before and they seem to be a hit.
2014-07-15 15:30:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good to know
2014-07-15 15:31:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty down with most sexual exploration you could want to do.
2014-07-15 15:35:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like it might hurt your feelings if I masturbated while we were living together.
2014-07-15 15:47:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the thing I'm looking forward to the most when we live together is knowing when conversations are over, hahaha
2014-07-15 17:33:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha sorry! Even when I do tell you I'm about to take a nap you usually keep texting me anyways 
2014-07-15 17:34:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't make me regret reinstating text conversations 
2014-07-15 18:03:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And to finish the conversation, I wouldn't begrudge you a little private time like that every once in a while.I think I would only be offended/concerned if it start to really cut into our sex life
2014-07-15 20:00:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you hear back from that guy about the mdma?
2014-07-15 20:05:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no

2014-07-15 20:08:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you message him after the weekend? Maybe he just forgot
2014-07-15 20:08:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no, I guess I could try him again.
2014-07-15 20:09:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure our sex life will eke by without it haha
2014-07-15 20:09:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe
2014-07-15 20:09:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you got all me all curious, though
2014-07-15 20:10:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can still get some from your other friend before August, right?
2014-07-15 20:10:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my Raleigh friend?

2014-07-15 20:11:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should probably let him know soon if we're doing that.
2014-07-15 20:11:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Up to you, but I'm down 
2014-07-15 20:12:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol I feel like that's probably an understatement
2014-07-15 20:12:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha it's not like something I'm burning to do as soon as possible
2014-07-15 20:12:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure it'll happen eventually 
2014-07-15 20:13:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]August does seem like a good time though, without much school going on
2014-07-15 20:14:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'll try to get some
2014-07-15 20:15:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to
2014-07-15 20:18:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is the guy who never gets drugs responsible for getting the drugs?
2014-07-15 20:18:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol

2014-07-15 20:19:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]About to drive to Monterey
2014-07-15 20:20:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]k
2014-07-15 22:03:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just remembered that we had sex six times in the span of 24 hours
2014-07-15 22:03:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that shit's ridiculous
2014-07-15 22:04:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I called you and you didn't answer, I thought you were asleep 
2014-07-15 22:04:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just took a shower
2014-07-15 22:05:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can talk now if you want
2014-07-15 22:05:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yes, that is pretty impressive 
2014-07-15 22:05:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was gonna ask if you could help me find a walmart
2014-07-15 22:06:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I think I found one
2014-07-15 22:06:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-07-15 22:08:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is your headache why you seemed a little cranky over text?
2014-07-15 22:09:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha probably a little bit of that and a little irked about the convo drop out
2014-07-15 22:10:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you really not want to find drugs?
2014-07-15 22:10:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no it's finer
2014-07-15 22:11:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or feel like I'm putting it on you when myself as the "druggy" should do it
2014-07-15 22:15:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like you would've been irked if I texted "I'm taking a nap, bye" or cut it off suddenly
2014-07-15 22:16:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean it's whatever
2014-07-15 22:16:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I recognize that's how you text
2014-07-15 22:16:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not mad

2014-07-16 13:18:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Isn't saying "26 hours!" a jinx?
2014-07-16 13:19:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You should jinx the jinx.
2014-07-16 13:21:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll never see you again!
2014-07-16 13:24:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha there you go.
2014-07-16 13:24:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I feel like that's tempting fate :o
2014-07-16 13:24:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The pilot is going to take you to a tropical island paradise.
2014-07-16 13:28:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That sounds nice :)
2014-07-16 13:28:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm driving btw, so expect poor texting

2014-07-16 14:34:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love how excited you get!

2014-07-16 21:30:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you not get Snapchat notifications?
2014-07-16 21:31:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not popping up on my phone, but I've also been dissecting oysters for the past 3 hours

2014-07-16 21:32:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, alright.

2014-07-16 21:37:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In situations like the picnic I'm actually pretty anti-social
2014-07-16 21:37:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]i.e. when groups of people know each other
2014-07-16 21:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I don't know anyone
2014-07-16 21:40:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can see that actually

2014-07-18 12:27:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then that I was stuck on a mountain waiting for ice to melt before I could drive back to you
2014-07-18 12:31:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe have our Montana trip on the mind?
2014-07-18 12:32:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, I think it was my awkward encounter with alexanzde and his girlfriend this morning, so I was awkward in this dream
2014-07-18 12:33:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha the well you're spelling Alexandre's name is hilarious.
2014-07-18 12:34:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But what was so awkward about it?
2014-07-18 12:34:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whatever 
2014-07-18 12:34:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, they were packing up and I was just looking for food and there was some small talk
2014-07-18 12:34:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just an awkward person sometimes
2014-07-18 13:10:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Warning, snap chat is NSFW

2014-07-21 09:04:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, the Laotian place is closed from 2-5p and probably doesn't do take out, so there goes that idea. But I'll still be nakedly awaiting your return  😚
2014-07-21 09:44:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man :(
2014-07-21 09:44:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What is the $100 for again?
2014-07-21 10:02:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For returning the kayak
2014-07-21 10:03:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol oh OK. I'm not accepting that :)
2014-07-21 10:16:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should, we made a deal
2014-07-21 10:17:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think we should be paying each other for favors haha
2014-07-21 10:22:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My joke didn't come off as well as I had hoped.
2014-07-21 10:23:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK I think your mom got it anyway. Haha.
2014-07-21 11:00:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, it was mostly a joke. Cause I do owe you money anyways 
2014-07-21 11:05:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You and my mother seem to have similar senses of humor
2014-07-21 11:07:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Finally rolling out of bed...
2014-07-21 11:09:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha what for?

2014-07-21 11:28:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, I meant why are you rolling out of bed. I already denied the $100
2014-07-21 11:40:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To eat some bacon and eggs, but don't worry I'm rolling right back in
2014-07-21 11:41:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What time will you be home do you think?
2014-07-21 11:41:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Around 3 I reckon.

2014-07-21 11:42:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't wait that long!
2014-07-21 11:42:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha

2014-07-21 18:07:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you bring a different perspective on a lot of things
2014-07-21 18:07:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and even just doing things with you makes them better
2014-07-21 18:07:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's hard to really explain why
2014-07-21 18:08:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even rowing a tandem kayak? Haha
2014-07-21 18:08:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah!
2014-07-21 18:08:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely rowing a tandem kayak
2014-07-21 18:08:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just like an endless loop of happiness
2014-07-21 18:08:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I'd be having a good time anyway
2014-07-21 18:09:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but knowing that you're having a good time makes it more fun for me
2014-07-21 18:09:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-07-21 18:09:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you appreciate beauty

2014-07-21 18:09:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it makes me more aware of those things
2014-07-21 18:10:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I like that you just care about me and want me to have a good time
2014-07-21 18:10:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that one's pretty selfish I suppose
2014-07-21 18:10:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I definitely like it about you
2014-07-21 18:10:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like that about you, very much 
2014-07-21 18:11:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That you're aware of me and if I'm enjoying myself 
2014-07-21 18:11:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I also think you're good at breaking tension
2014-07-21 18:11:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like sharing things with you, the "sensory things" 
2014-07-21 18:12:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, good. I hope you keep doing that!
2014-07-21 18:12:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tension between us?

2014-07-21 18:12:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not that things ever really get that tense
2014-07-21 18:12:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I feel like you read me well
2014-07-21 18:13:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and know how to steer me away from bad vibes
2014-07-21 18:14:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You respond though, it's not just me steering you away 
2014-07-21 18:15:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we both do a good job of not sweating the small stuff, or getting petty 
2014-07-21 18:15:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, for sure
2014-07-21 18:16:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I like watching movies and TV shows with you!

2014-07-21 18:17:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just like to tease you a little
2014-07-21 18:18:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're going to have a True Detective binge in August though

2014-07-21 18:18:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just really looking forward to the day when I get to spend the majority of my time with you
2014-07-21 18:18:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or I guess the majority of time in the same area as you
2014-07-21 18:20:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're going to look back one day at these 14 months and be super grateful we stuck it out 
2014-07-21 18:20:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt
2014-07-21 18:20:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's already worth it for me

2014-07-21 22:08:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't stop rereading all the sweet things you send to me. Obviously I love it most when I get to hear them in person while being held in your arms, but it's nice to have something to hold on to when I'm away from you :)
2014-07-21 22:08:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sleep well my darling
2014-07-21 22:13:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-07-21 22:14:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like how you call me "darling" and "my love". They're kinda old-fashioned.
2014-07-21 22:16:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are they? I feel like sugar is old fashioned 
2014-07-21 22:17:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Darling is definitely old-fashioned I think.
2014-07-21 22:17:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh my darling, Clementine, e.g.
2014-07-21 22:17:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What can I say, you know I'm a romantic at heart 
2014-07-21 22:17:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I like it :)
2014-07-21 22:18:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They make me feel special
2014-07-21 22:18:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause you're my darling and mine alone :)
2014-07-21 22:21:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yep, and I like that you seem to like being mine
2014-07-21 22:22:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love it so much!
2014-07-21 22:22:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright, plane #2 is heading out. Talk to you later, mwah!

2014-07-22 12:56:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For some reason I thought it was like 6 hours away 
2014-07-22 12:56:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeesh. Right back on the grind.
2014-07-22 12:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you gonna be heading out soon then?
2014-07-22 12:59:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have to dissect some oysters I didn't yet to last Wednesday
2014-07-22 12:59:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I couldn't fall asleep  until 3am PST!
2014-07-22 13:00:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This place is cursed for sleeping
2014-07-22 13:01:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Damn that's late!
2014-07-22 13:01:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It makes even less sense when you consider the time change.
2014-07-22 13:01:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That should've felt super late to you.
2014-07-22 13:01:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No kidding 
2014-07-22 13:02:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think cause I slept for like 2 hours on the 2nd plane
2014-07-22 13:02:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah, yeah I'm sure that was part of it.
2014-07-22 13:02:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Another long night then?
2014-07-22 13:03:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-07-22 13:04:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just highlighting how extra shitty it was to be sleeping without you
2014-07-22 13:04:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:(
2014-07-22 13:04:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I'll be free this evening if you want to talk during your drive.
2014-07-22 13:05:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-07-22 13:12:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a new blog post!
2014-07-22 13:14:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet! I'll check it out in a bit.
2014-07-22 13:14:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're blog title is easy to find. The #2 Google hit for "Getting My Genes Wet"
2014-07-22 13:36:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What # hit is it for "get me wet"
2014-07-22 13:37:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol, probably shouldn't search for that at work.
2014-07-22 13:38:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You should link to your colleagues academic pages the first time you mention them.
2014-07-22 13:38:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Colleagues'
2014-07-22 13:51:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True 
2014-07-22 13:52:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You should definitely have your own academic page and link to it (and say your name!!!) on the About page too.
2014-07-22 13:53:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah, duh
2014-07-22 13:53:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't have a web page!
2014-07-22 13:54:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Make one. It doesn't need to be complicated. A couple lines on your research and a link to your CV.
2014-07-22 13:54:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess a picture too.
2014-07-22 13:55:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhh
2014-07-22 13:55:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll do it tomorrow
2014-07-22 13:55:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't even started cutting open oysters yet today lol
2014-07-22 13:56:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha I didn't mean you have to do it now!
2014-07-22 13:56:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So grumpy :)
2014-07-22 14:07:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know I appreciate the advice thought
2014-07-22 14:10:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, but I'd give it to you anyway ;)

2014-07-22 21:27:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-22 21:28:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's cool I guess
2014-07-22 21:29:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was pretty random. I haven't talked to her since Hannah and I broke up.
2014-07-22 21:35:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] I'm finally gonna try that quesarito
2014-07-22 21:35:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha let me know how it is
2014-07-22 21:38:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh yeah, I started watching The Godfather last night
2014-07-22 21:38:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that movie is THE SHIT
2014-07-22 21:40:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Have you not seen it before?
2014-07-22 21:40:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no I have
2014-07-22 21:40:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that movie is STILL THE SHIT
2014-07-22 21:47:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm my ice cream was melted in its freezer bag
2014-07-22 21:47:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]melted and re-frozen
2014-07-22 21:48:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maaaan HBO GO didn't save my spot!
2014-07-22 21:50:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Michael Corleone had just wasted those two guys in the restaurant
2014-07-22 21:50:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It always saves my spot
2014-07-22 21:51:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if it's the PS3 app or something
2014-07-22 21:51:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you just turn the ps3 off?
2014-07-22 21:51:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or exit back to menu first?
2014-07-22 21:51:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe
2014-07-22 21:52:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty sure I just turned it off
2014-07-22 21:52:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't so that
2014-07-22 21:52:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There is a fruit fly in the far with me 
2014-07-22 21:53:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, yeah that works
2014-07-22 21:53:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it's going to be the death if me
2014-07-22 21:53:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-22 21:53:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]driving you crazy?
2014-07-22 21:53:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You have no idea
2014-07-22 21:54:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there was a mosquito in the elevator at Red Hat this morning
2014-07-22 21:55:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Somehow a 30 sec elevator ride doesn't seem quite as bad as a 10 hr drive
2014-07-22 21:55:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha, I believe that was, as you would put it, "sassy"
2014-07-22 21:56:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who me? Never
2014-07-22 21:56:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-07-22 21:57:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]watching The Godfather made me think I wished I believed in free will because than I could be mean to assholes and not feel bad about it
2014-07-22 21:57:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or take pleasure in their comeuppance
2014-07-22 21:57:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I definitely get a special kind of rise out of that
2014-07-22 21:58:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that I have to then coach back down
2014-07-22 21:58:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can still do that, and just chalk it up to your own deterministic nature 
2014-07-22 21:58:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-22 21:58:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]truth
2014-07-22 21:58:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well-played
2014-07-22 21:59:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm smirking a little at that one
2014-07-22 21:59:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha I'm loling
2014-07-22 22:05:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you see that video I posted on Facebook?
2014-07-22 22:06:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think so
2014-07-22 22:06:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-07-22 22:16:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The Godfather had three nominees for Best Supporting Actor
2014-07-22 22:20:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a well acclaimed movie
2014-07-22 22:20:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm assuming not one you think is over hyped? Haha
2014-07-22 22:21:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]three nominees for a single category is sort of interesting on its own, though
2014-07-22 22:21:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and yeah I don't think it's over-hyped
2014-07-22 23:28:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You asleep?
2014-07-22 23:29:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nope
2014-07-22 23:30:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why you no answer phone? :((((((((
2014-07-22 23:30:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Gimme one minute. I'm turning my computer on.
2014-07-22 23:48:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1155 Airport Park Blvd, Ukiah CA 95482
2014-07-23 00:22:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to build a Markov model of our sex
2014-07-23 00:27:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How can we collect the data though??
2014-07-23 06:49:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't need data to build the model, the parameters just probably won't be accurate.
2014-07-23 07:11:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I saw this comment on reddit, " My wife always tells me when I'm about to orgasm. There were a few times when I didn't even feel it, so I was confused when she said it. A couple seconds later... pop!  Sex after a stressful day at work: "Keep going, you're about to cum" ... "There you go" ... "Feel better?"  She's freaking amazing. "
2014-07-23 07:11:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can you do that?
2014-07-23 08:28:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What parameters would you incorporate? The ones you mentioned yesterday about different positions?
2014-07-23 08:29:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You usually give a pretty vocal heads up, so it's hard to say
2014-07-23 08:30:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely can when you're in my mouth 
2014-07-23 08:32:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And maybe when we're in missionary and I'm not too distracted by myself 
2014-07-23 08:33:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice. And yeah, different positions, transition probabilities, time in position, orgasm expectation, etc.
2014-07-23 08:33:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll draw one up and send it to you later.
2014-07-23 08:34:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm assuming I'm not talking to your kidnapper right now?
2014-07-23 08:37:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm offended you believe kidnappers like myself don't know what a markov model is
2014-07-23 08:37:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha sorry, it's early 
2014-07-23 08:38:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The jokes aren't flowin yet
2014-07-23 08:39:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When does this "flowin" usually start? ;)
2014-07-23 08:43:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Never before 7a
2014-07-23 11:11:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The guy forgot we were meeting 
2014-07-23 11:11:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Grrrr

2014-07-23 11:39:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He came a minute after I texted you and we already got the oysters!
2014-07-23 11:40:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh sweet!
2014-07-23 11:42:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Today as been one of those really annoying days.
2014-07-23 11:42:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gonna go traipse around in the redwood national park for a little bit, then find a place to sleep lik
2014-07-23 11:42:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]At least so far.
2014-07-23 11:43:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Annoying at work?
2014-07-23 11:43:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah. Just stupid little things happening. That sounds like fun, though!
2014-07-23 11:43:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I'm sure you could use some rest
2014-07-23 11:44:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I'll sleep in a tree!
2014-07-23 11:44:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry honey
2014-07-23 11:44:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eat a bomb pop later and think of me
2014-07-23 11:44:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK :)
2014-07-23 11:44:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't promise it'll make anything better
2014-07-23 11:45:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But at least you'll have a bomb pop lol
2014-07-23 11:45:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Bomb Pops always make things better.
2014-07-23 11:46:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And thinking of you too I guess ;)
2014-07-23 11:46:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And thinking of me!!
2014-07-23 11:46:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-07-23 11:46:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘
2014-07-23 12:15:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When we get our little camper, we should drive/camp along highway 101
2014-07-23 12:20:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like fun.
2014-07-23 12:21:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You hit a lot of parks/forests and quaint weird little towns 
2014-07-23 12:22:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice. It has quite the Wikipedia article too

2014-07-23 15:57:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. That'd be nice too.
2014-07-23 15:58:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Went on a 2 hour hike through really amazing forest
2014-07-23 15:58:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And saw a banana slug!
2014-07-23 15:58:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sweet!
2014-07-23 15:58:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sounds awesome
2014-07-23 15:58:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was getting a little delirious from lack of sleep and real food towards the end 
2014-07-23 15:59:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I've found a motel with a freezer for my oysters and free wifi for $50, so I'm gonna pass the fuck out for a few hours 
2014-07-23 15:59:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds like a good idea
2014-07-23 16:01:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you

2014-07-23 16:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-23 16:04:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd hope not! 
2014-07-23 16:05:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially after only ~1 month in the same city
2014-07-23 16:05:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-07-23 16:05:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I've been moving the opposite direction
2014-07-23 16:06:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Towards being less sick of me?
2014-07-23 16:06:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-23 16:06:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's one way to put it I suppose
2014-07-23 16:06:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I still learn new things about you every day 
2014-07-23 16:07:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I still like them all 
2014-07-23 16:07:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, well aren't you being loving    😃

2014-07-23 16:11:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I figure you got a little sassy Katie yesterday, so I'd spice it up haha
2014-07-23 16:11:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should try not to be so impatient
2014-07-23 16:12:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I was more referring to having to look for a place in Dallas
2014-07-23 16:12:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I see
2014-07-23 16:12:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're pulling back again, huh?
2014-07-23 16:12:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're so funny
2014-07-23 16:12:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm going to be in charge of finding our Chicago apartment?
2014-07-23 16:13:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah, I'll help then
2014-07-23 16:13:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'll be looking for leases
2014-07-23 16:13:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it'll be easier I think
2014-07-23 16:13:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not pulling back! It's just the situation isn't going to change for a long time and I don't want us to get worn out before then
2014-07-23 16:13:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]worn out in what way?
2014-07-23 16:14:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In the "I don't like how things are now" way
2014-07-23 16:14:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Focus on the positives!
2014-07-23 16:14:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, yeah

2014-07-23 18:53:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she's definitely fear-mongering
2014-07-23 18:55:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A cousin on your moms side?

2014-07-23 19:20:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-07-23 19:21:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]isn't it crazy how this relationship wouldn't even be possible for like 99.999% of human history
2014-07-23 19:21:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What flavor HH are you having my dear?
2014-07-23 19:21:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It could've been possible
2014-07-23 19:21:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]four cheese lasagna
2014-07-23 19:21:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do you figure
2014-07-23 19:22:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just with snail mail, a lot more imagination, and longer time between visits
2014-07-23 19:22:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't be in grad school though, so more likely I would've just up and married you
2014-07-23 19:22:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-23 19:24:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what if you were some bourgeois  aristocrat and I was a proletariat revolutionary?
2014-07-23 19:25:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you capitalist pig you
2014-07-23 19:28:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or I a serving wench with big dreams and you're the aristocrat
2014-07-23 19:45:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha are we developing potential roleplaying prompts?
2014-07-23 19:53:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like how we both fashioned ourselves as "revolutionarily minded underdogs"
2014-07-23 19:55:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah. I guess I could get into being the bad guy, though.
2014-07-23 19:56:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I could get into being bourgeois 
2014-07-23 19:56:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I picked the fancier restaurant
2014-07-23 19:56:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And wish you were here to try elk with me!
2014-07-23 19:57:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too. Nice hashtag ;)
2014-07-23 19:58:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you'd like it
2014-07-23 20:02:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should've brought my computer
2014-07-23 20:02:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we could've Hangouts over dinner
2014-07-23 20:02:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Looked like a real crazy person
2014-07-23 20:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww
2014-07-23 20:03:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm "working from home" right now

2014-07-23 20:05:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have to take the effing car to the effing dealership because my mom was being relentlessly bitchy
2014-07-23 20:05:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Rawr
2014-07-23 20:05:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was one of the annoying things that happened today
2014-07-23 20:05:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the first thing was I shook my open orange juice can
2014-07-23 20:05:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and got O.J. all over my computer
2014-07-23 20:06:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh nooooo
2014-07-23 20:06:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and now the space bar is sticky
2014-07-23 20:06:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I looked up a way one time to fix sticky keys
2014-07-23 20:07:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it worked wonderfully 
2014-07-23 20:07:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Baby oil maybe?
2014-07-23 20:07:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what'd you do?
2014-07-23 20:07:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Google it
2014-07-23 20:07:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've spilled many a beverage on my keyboard
2014-07-23 20:07:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A fact I'm sure does not surprise you
2014-07-23 20:08:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know why you'd think such a thing
2014-07-23 20:10:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that Pony Up technologies lady gave me a call
2014-07-23 20:11:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like I got an internship if I want it
2014-07-23 20:11:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-07-23 20:11:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you going to take it
2014-07-23 20:12:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mayb
2014-07-23 20:12:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]e
2014-07-23 20:12:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]need more details
2014-07-23 20:12:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like it could be fun
2014-07-23 20:12:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]data analysis on horse health metrics
2014-07-23 20:13:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm curious how much it pays
2014-07-23 20:13:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ajay was apparently offered an unpaid internship
2014-07-23 20:13:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I hope this lady isn't expecting something like that
2014-07-23 20:14:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but she knows I'm interning at Red Hat
2014-07-23 20:14:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and was familiar with the company
2014-07-23 20:14:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm assuming she realizes that won't fly
2014-07-23 20:14:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-07-23 20:14:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did Ajay take it?
2014-07-23 20:14:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-07-23 20:14:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he eventually got a paid one
2014-07-23 20:15:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a computer science student would have to be desperate as fuck to take an unpaid internship
2014-07-23 20:15:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might have a place
2014-07-23 20:16:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So both the ones you contacted yesterday fell through?
2014-07-23 20:16:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]DIdn't really fall through as much as neither of them responded.
2014-07-23 20:16:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This dude just responded, though.
2014-07-23 20:17:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]4 miles from campus
2014-07-23 20:18:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a little three BR house in Richardson
2014-07-23 20:21:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And a bus nearby to take younaves?
2014-07-23 20:21:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*places
2014-07-23 20:21:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-07-23 20:22:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably come to around $500/month
2014-07-23 20:22:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]including utilities
2014-07-23 20:22:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is probably about $250 cheaper than what I was paying last year
2014-07-23 20:23:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's like a flight a month ;)
2014-07-23 20:23:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]exactly    😃 
2014-07-23 20:23:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and has a washer and dryer
2014-07-23 20:23:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so no dealing with that bullshit
2014-07-23 20:23:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they have a pet rabbit
2014-07-23 20:23:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's a couple
2014-07-23 20:23:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What!!!!
2014-07-23 20:23:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably a nerdy couple it sounds like
2014-07-23 20:24:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You have to take it
2014-07-23 20:24:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he plays RPGs with his friends on Sunday apparently
2014-07-23 20:27:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like it could be chill 
2014-07-23 20:27:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But seriously
2014-07-23 20:27:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want a bunny there when I visit 
2014-07-23 20:27:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-23 20:27:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'll try to land this spot
2014-07-23 20:34:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I just ate one of the better meals in my life
2014-07-23 20:34:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no shit
2014-07-23 20:35:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the elk sausage lived up to the hype?
2014-07-23 20:35:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I decided to go with seafood stew instead
2014-07-23 20:36:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mussels, 2 kinds of clam, squid, and the most perfectly poached fish ever
2014-07-23 20:36:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was like a cloud in my mouth
2014-07-23 20:36:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A warm, tomatoey cloud
2014-07-23 20:37:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-23 20:37:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-07-23 20:37:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't believe you didn't try any elk, though!
2014-07-23 20:37:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's pretty awesome it was a good meal
2014-07-23 20:37:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much did it cost?
2014-07-23 20:37:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, but I figured it would probably taste just like venison sausage 
2014-07-23 20:38:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it was kind of weird to eat the things I was just looking at this morning
2014-07-23 20:38:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]$18
2014-07-23 20:38:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Totally worth it
2014-07-23 20:39:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's not bad at all
2014-07-23 20:39:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you were just looking at oysters!
2014-07-23 20:39:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you didn't eat any, though
2014-07-23 20:39:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kill those all the time though
2014-07-23 20:39:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I could kill an elk
2014-07-23 20:40:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate that I'm that way
2014-07-23 20:40:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Inconsistent, as you'd say
2014-07-23 20:40:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think that's inconsistent
2014-07-23 20:40:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least it doesn't have to be
2014-07-23 20:47:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I guess
2014-07-23 20:47:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They forgot to put prawns in my stew 
2014-07-23 20:47:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I got free dessert!
2014-07-23 20:48:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dammmmnnnn, girl
2014-07-23 20:48:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yo lucky day

2014-07-23 20:49:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, imagine how tasty it would've been if everything was in there!
2014-07-23 20:49:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good point
2014-07-23 20:49:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]House made Key lime pie
2014-07-23 20:49:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and?

2014-07-23 20:50:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was it?
2014-07-23 20:51:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whyd you ask "and"?
2014-07-23 20:52:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and how was it
2014-07-23 20:52:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhhhhh
2014-07-23 20:52:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Duh

2014-07-23 20:52:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it looks promising
2014-07-23 20:52:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha cool
2014-07-23 20:53:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wanna video in a bit?

2014-07-23 20:53:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dat's cool
2014-07-23 22:56:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That Jeff bridges thing made me tear up
2014-07-23 22:56:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe because I'm exhausted and shouldn't have gotten on your Facebook and gone to sleep instead :)
2014-07-23 22:57:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure that's the only reason    😃 
2014-07-23 22:58:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you lots
2014-07-23 22:59:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love that you so openly care about love that way
2014-07-23 23:00:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't put on "tough guy" personas, or really any persona
2014-07-23 23:00:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're so unapologetically yourself, and it's crazy refreshing
2014-07-23 23:01:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-07-23 23:01:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]thanks so much
2014-07-23 23:01:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that made me feel really good
2014-07-23 23:02:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel so lucky that you're actually into all of me and I get to completely be myself
2014-07-23 23:04:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're so amazing
2014-07-23 23:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I selfishly want you all the time

2014-07-23 23:04:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and enjoy life
2014-07-23 23:05:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm glad I can still make you feel that way when we're apart too 
2014-07-23 23:06:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too    😃 
2014-07-23 23:06:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know I said it the other day, but I feel like you just get me
2014-07-23 23:07:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if you're consciously doing the things you do or if you're just naturally behaving the way you do
2014-07-23 23:07:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it really makes things flow between us
2014-07-23 23:08:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I obviously like making you happy, but I don't think I ever contrive what I'm saying or doing 
2014-07-23 23:09:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think maybe we're just perfect for each other :)

2014-07-23 23:09:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I agree
2014-07-23 23:09:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're definitely perfect for me at least
2014-07-23 23:10:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just want to make your life as wonderful as I can to repay you for all the happiness you give me
2014-07-23 23:10:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You definitely already do

2014-07-23 23:13:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok I'm going to sleep! No more internet stalking you or texting sweet nothings. 
2014-07-23 23:14:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oooook
2014-07-23 23:14:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's probably for the best
2014-07-23 23:14:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you
2014-07-23 23:14:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm so happy I found you
2014-07-23 23:14:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or you found me
2014-07-23 23:14:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though let's be real, you're the only person I've ever met that I would willingly give up sleep for
2014-07-23 23:14:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that the universe brought us together!
2014-07-23 23:15:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well I'm honored
2014-07-23 23:15:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely the universe gets the credit on this one 
2014-07-23 23:15:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for sure
2014-07-23 23:15:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And a little bit of me wanting to get some in march.....
2014-07-23 23:15:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-23 23:16:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To my libido! 
2014-07-23 23:16:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you're sexiness!
2014-07-23 23:16:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*your
2014-07-23 23:16:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'll take it
2014-07-23 23:16:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah
2014-07-23 23:17:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight, the love of my life
2014-07-23 23:17:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet dreams, beautiful  😘   
2014-07-23 23:39:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just thinking about how you said you thought we would've hooked up in March later that week even if it hadn't happened that Wednesday and I actually don't think that's the case. I was going to stay with Brett those last few nights! Just a crazy chain of events.
2014-07-23 23:43:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm that might've made things weirder you're right. I guess it's hard for me to imagine things working out any different than they had really, because the idea that this might've never been is so ridiculous.
2014-07-23 23:44:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And would've undoubtedly been a slightly duller life
2014-07-23 23:44:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'm saying I can't imagine my life, now or going forward, without you in it
2014-07-23 23:48:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe I got in the way of you sleeping with an even more amazing guy on Thursday night. Haha.
2014-07-23 23:48:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A jazz tuba playing gourmet chef travel channel host.
2014-07-23 23:49:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think Stewart Edie is any if those things 
2014-07-23 23:50:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Don't forget sex god!
2014-07-23 23:50:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha aw, man. I even cock-blocked the dude.
2014-07-23 23:50:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I would've slept with him on the first date 
2014-07-23 23:51:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yeah, you probably did cock block him at some level. 
2014-07-23 23:52:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just remembered, that I was running on 4 hours if sleep that Wednesday 
2014-07-23 23:52:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I had to get up before dawn to finish my paper
2014-07-23 23:53:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I almost fell asleep on the bus ride back from pizza 
2014-07-23 23:54:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who knew you were setting the tone for our relationship, keeping me from sleeping just so I can talk to you more :(
2014-07-23 23:54:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*:)
2014-07-23 23:55:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha sorry. You can sleep. You guys silence your phone yo.
2014-07-23 23:56:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*gotta
2014-07-23 23:56:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm paranoid it'll make the alarm not work
2014-07-23 23:56:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or my mom will have a heart attack
2014-07-23 23:56:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or a tsunami will come and I won't get the flood warning 
2014-07-23 23:57:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I have the volume on when I play PvZ2
2014-07-23 23:57:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well that's pretty dark.
2014-07-23 23:57:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm morbid yo
2014-07-23 23:57:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you'd pick up on that by now
2014-07-23 23:59:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I guess now that I think about it that seems to be the case.
2014-07-24 00:06:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the sort of blatant butterfly effect aspect of our relationship helps me not take it for granted and keeps me humble.
2014-07-24 07:10:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My dad said we'll be at Disney the 21st through 26th for sure.
2014-07-24 09:04:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woohoo, that's awese
2014-07-24 09:04:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And when does your break start?
2014-07-24 09:05:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Las exam day is Dec. 18
2014-07-24 09:06:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm working on building our Markov Model
2014-07-24 09:07:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]while "on the clock"
2014-07-24 09:07:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you getting paid to do that? Lol
2014-07-24 09:07:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's great 
2014-07-24 09:08:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So classes start for you Jan 12
2014-07-24 09:09:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I guess it makes sense for us to meet at Disney, then you come to Chicago?
2014-07-24 09:10:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sure    😃 
2014-07-24 09:10:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we can get to Orlando like a day early and stay at hotel just us
2014-07-24 09:11:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]someone's gonna want the D?
2014-07-24 09:11:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone's definitely gonna want the PHAT
2014-07-24 09:11:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]??
2014-07-24 09:12:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]-pussy, hips, ass, and titties
2014-07-24 09:12:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-07-24 09:12:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that a thing?
2014-07-24 09:12:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-07-24 09:13:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's where that word originally came from 
2014-07-24 09:13:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely not
2014-07-24 09:13:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty hot and tempting
2014-07-24 09:13:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=phat
2014-07-24 09:13:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the meaning I knew
2014-07-24 09:13:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it didn't make sense the way you used it
2014-07-24 09:15:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Huh
2014-07-24 09:15:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno
2014-07-24 09:18:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] So I decided at 2a the best choice for my safety and sanity was to stay at the hotel and sleep until 7a, and then dissect and drive today and collect tomorrow
2014-07-24 09:18:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think that's probably a good idea
2014-07-24 09:19:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It means my last collecting day won't have a great tide, but will still be doable 
2014-07-24 09:20:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When is your last collecting day?
2014-07-24 09:21:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For Oregon? July 27
2014-07-24 09:21:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh I see
2014-07-24 11:02:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we've had sex at most 80 times
2014-07-24 11:07:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What about it?
2014-07-24 11:07:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In the initial probabilities
2014-07-24 11:07:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Initial position
2014-07-24 11:08:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If we've done it twice, that's almost 3%
2014-07-24 11:19:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So what numbers do you have an issue with?
2014-07-24 11:20:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I put my own column
2014-07-24 11:26:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Those are fine. Mine were just filler really, just to sort of make the model more concrete.
2014-07-24 11:26:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really trust either of our numbers.
2014-07-24 11:27:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think mine are better approximations 
2014-07-24 11:27:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you left out a position!
2014-07-24 11:28:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah, I see that now. That's definitely the rarest position by a considerable margin.
2014-07-24 11:28:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's happened twice
2014-07-24 11:28:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Now I have to add it to all the other sheets.
2014-07-24 11:28:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha you have a count?
2014-07-24 11:29:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No but I it's easy to count up to two
2014-07-24 11:29:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But you've obviously noted both times we've done it.
2014-07-24 11:30:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well yeah. I like starting that way in the mornings sometimes
2014-07-24 11:30:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You could've told me five and I would've believed you.
2014-07-24 11:30:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well why don't we do that more then?
2014-07-24 11:31:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We've only spent like 25 mornings together 
2014-07-24 11:32:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And don't have sex immediately every one
2014-07-24 11:33:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha fair enough
2014-07-24 11:34:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how'd you feel about "Orgasms Per Second"?
2014-07-24 11:35:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have to think about it
2014-07-24 11:35:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-07-24 11:35:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm writing a program to simulate our sexy time sessions
2014-07-24 11:35:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-24 11:52:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The fact that you like spooning in the morning is interesting. That'd be another variable to collect.
2014-07-24 11:52:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Time of day.
2014-07-24 11:52:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Type and level of intoxication would be interesting too.
2014-07-24 11:53:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well that's the first vs 2nd sex of the day factor I mentioned
2014-07-24 11:53:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, that would definitely be worth keeping.
2014-07-24 11:54:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When I'm still sleepy it can be kind of nice to stay in a comfy position lol
2014-07-24 11:54:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get what you were saying about us having had sex at most 80 times now
2014-07-24 11:54:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was underestimating
2014-07-24 11:54:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I can dig that!
2014-07-24 12:01:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This would make a good TG
2014-07-24 13:17:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Over $300 to get the car fixed and the found two other things that would've cost over an extra $1200.
2014-07-24 13:18:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pretty good argument to not buy a car.
2014-07-24 13:18:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or to not by a shitty model/used car
2014-07-24 13:19:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that's pretty ridiculous 
2014-07-24 13:19:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]New cars are expensive as fuck, though.
2014-07-24 13:20:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I'm not really sure that's more economical.
2014-07-24 13:21:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gently used then
2014-07-24 13:21:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hondas are the shit for that 
2014-07-24 13:21:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. That's what I hear.
2014-07-24 13:23:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Found a radio station playing orchestral soundtracks of classic movies 
2014-07-24 13:23:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty great 
2014-07-24 13:24:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice. Like what?
2014-07-24 13:24:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So far to kill a mockingbird and north by northwest 
2014-07-24 13:25:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. I wouldn't recognize either of those.
2014-07-24 13:25:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I've seen either.
2014-07-24 13:28:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You haven't seen to kill a mockingbird?!
2014-07-24 13:29:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Actually, now that I think about it, we might've watched it in high school when we read the book, but I have zero recollection of it.
2014-07-24 13:33:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]About to get hangry
2014-07-24 13:34:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh 
2014-07-24 13:37:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Had some Rice Krispies Treats cereal this morning.
2014-07-24 13:37:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you at work now?
2014-07-24 13:39:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No. Still at the VW place.
2014-07-24 13:51:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh that does suck 
2014-07-24 13:54:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They just finished so I get to do the intern Olympics.
2014-07-24 13:54:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kick some ass
2014-07-24 13:55:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll defend your honor.
2014-07-24 14:12:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ha none of the interns in my group are going.
2014-07-24 14:42:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I bet Justin will get a good picture of us in Montana.
2014-07-24 14:43:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Finally!
2014-07-24 14:47:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah. I never got to put up a picture of us in my office space :(
2014-07-24 15:22:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Getting paid to drink again. Easiest $200 I've ever made.
2014-07-24 15:23:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's not true.
2014-07-24 15:23:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's the easiest?
2014-07-24 15:24:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]One of the days where I just watched videos.
2014-07-24 15:39:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not a bad deal
2014-07-24 15:40:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you didn't play any games?
2014-07-24 16:32:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]stumbled into a Christian coffee shop by accident....
2014-07-24 16:35:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha what does that mean?
2014-07-24 16:41:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wanted to patron a local place instead of Starbucks for my coffee. And ended up surrounded by bible verses, Christian rock, and a wifi password of "fellowship"
2014-07-24 16:43:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that's awesome #Pray4Me
2014-07-24 16:55:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So what's on the agenda for tonight?
2014-07-24 16:57:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I saw a sign for this and got excited
2014-07-24 16:57:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://theworldlink.com/oregon-coast-music-festival-july/article_edd6cf70-083a-11e4-849c-0019bb2963f4.html
2014-07-24 16:57:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but the event tonight sounds meh
2014-07-24 16:58:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, one of the barista's sat down in the couch across from me, offered me a cookie, tried to make small talk, and then when he realized I was busy started reading the bible
2014-07-24 16:58:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]where am I
2014-07-24 16:59:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-24 16:59:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the hills of Oregon apparently
2014-07-24 16:59:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if they're like hippie-Christian
2014-07-24 17:14:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They seem pretty clean cut to me
2014-07-24 17:30:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Position: Doggy Style Time: 95.5758302967 Katie Orgasms: 0.159293050526 Michael Orgasms: 0.0 Position: Missionary Time: 257.958783019 Katie Orgasms: 1.59239740075 Michael Orgasms: 0.537414131204 Position: Doggy Style Time: 261.081889855 Katie Orgasms: 2.68023860856 Michael Orgasms: 1.4076870973

2014-07-24 17:36:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you never have orgasms in doggy style?

2014-07-24 17:37:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you never have orgasms when we start with you eating me out?
2014-07-24 17:37:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't orgasm while eating you out
2014-07-24 17:38:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ohhh I see

2014-07-24 17:38:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my orgasm estimates actually seem to be not bad
2014-07-24 17:39:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we had sex for 8.5 minutes
2014-07-24 17:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had one orgasm
2014-07-24 17:39:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you had two
2014-07-24 17:39:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sounds about right
2014-07-24 17:39:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this model doesn't have the spooning parameters
2014-07-24 17:39:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what's the name for liquids like Gook?
2014-07-24 17:40:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-07-24 17:40:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that stuff that gets harder with more force
2014-07-24 17:40:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]non-Newtonian fluids
2014-07-24 17:40:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but there's another word
2014-07-24 17:40:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you said that last time too
2014-07-24 17:41:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]colloid!
2014-07-24 17:41:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I only know them as non-Newtonian
2014-07-24 17:41:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]colloid
2014-07-24 17:41:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not what a colloid is
2014-07-24 17:41:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]is another term
2014-07-24 17:42:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]https://www.exploratorium.edu/science_explorer/ooze.html
2014-07-24 17:42:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are probably colloids that are non-Newtonian
2014-07-24 17:42:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]thixotropic
2014-07-24 17:42:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess
2014-07-24 17:42:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they aren't synonyms, though
2014-07-24 17:44:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no its not thixotropic
2014-07-24 18:29:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Might not have service tonight

2014-07-24 22:11:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How long did that take you to write?
2014-07-24 22:12:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a couple of hours
2014-07-24 22:13:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had no idea you were a poet 
2014-07-24 22:13:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's perfect
2014-07-24 22:13:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to frame it
2014-07-24 22:13:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-07-24 22:13:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad you like it.
2014-07-24 22:14:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's get married
2014-07-24 22:14:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right now

2014-07-24 22:14:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just as I always wanted
2014-07-24 22:15:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty proud of that last stanza
2014-07-24 22:15:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my whole motivation for writing it was because I felt like I've been having trouble expressing how I feel about you recently
2014-07-24 22:16:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's a different kind of experience for me
2014-07-24 22:16:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just really amazed by you
2014-07-24 22:16:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you make me so happy
2014-07-24 22:17:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How is that possible? I feel like you tell me daily the sweetest kindest things I've ever heard
2014-07-24 22:17:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, well I'm glad you feel that way
2014-07-24 22:17:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess they just never feel like they're fully capturing how I feel about you
2014-07-24 22:17:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's like they aren't big enough
2014-07-24 22:20:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel that way all the time 
2014-07-24 22:20:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even when I'm with you
2014-07-24 22:21:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I just can't possibly be conveying how I feel
2014-07-24 22:21:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'm glad we can relate on that then haha
2014-07-25 10:33:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What time you getting on the road today?
2014-07-25 10:33:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]4 I think.
2014-07-25 10:34:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How has your morning been?
2014-07-25 10:34:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Successful
2014-07-25 10:35:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice!
2014-07-25 10:37:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Found lots of oysters, getting some coffee, and going to dissect in a bit
2014-07-25 10:37:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a shitty time sleeping on the ground last night though 
2014-07-25 10:37:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kept waking up with body parts asleep
2014-07-25 10:39:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man :(
2014-07-25 10:40:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think your body is supposed to adjust if you do it enough, but you might not reach that point.
2014-07-25 10:43:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm going to buy a pad
2014-07-25 10:44:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably a worthwhile investment.
2014-07-25 10:45:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely 
2014-07-25 10:46:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like my brother is going to inherit a lot of free things I can't take back
2014-07-25 10:46:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like this big cooler
2014-07-25 10:47:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice. Have you accumulated a lot of stuff?
2014-07-25 10:48:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Feels like it
2014-07-25 10:48:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm flying SWA home so might be able to pack most of it 
2014-07-25 10:49:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You can't have too much, right? You've been living out of a car!
2014-07-25 10:50:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can fit a lot in a car lol
2014-07-25 10:51:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also I'm gonna be a lil toasty when you pick me up in Chicago 
2014-07-25 10:51:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gotta use my drink coupons!
2014-07-25 10:51:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice. Aka definitely passing out when we get back to your place.
2014-07-25 10:52:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or definitely wanting to get frisky 
2014-07-25 10:53:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha it's like sexy Russian roulette.
2014-07-25 10:54:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure whether most of the chambers are empty or full, though.
2014-07-25 10:54:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Should I move my flight to the 13 so I can ensure I can have lunch with your parents?
2014-07-25 10:55:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's your call.
2014-07-25 10:56:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It cuts into spending time with you 
2014-07-25 10:56:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So it's kind of your call too
2014-07-25 10:56:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Then I want to see you the 12yh
2014-07-25 10:57:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha ok
2014-07-25 11:11:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Chalkboard tables at this restaurant
2014-07-25 11:16:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's you and me!

2014-07-25 11:17:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Looks just like me!
2014-07-25 11:17:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is that another new sticker?!
2014-07-25 11:21:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha nah I got that one a while ago I think
2014-07-25 11:22:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm going not start taking advantage of them more
2014-07-25 11:22:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially if I get this response!
2014-07-25 11:29:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol I just noticed the stubble on my face.
2014-07-25 11:29:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'm quite proud of that
2014-07-25 12:00:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There are still badges?!
2014-07-25 12:00:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know! Maybe they're bringing them back?
2014-07-25 12:06:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's a word for a treat you buy yourself at the beginning of the day as a reward for after a hard days work 
2014-07-25 12:08:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Incentive?
2014-07-25 12:09:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes!
2014-07-25 12:10:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think my brain woke up with me today 
2014-07-25 12:19:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you get yourself an incentive?
2014-07-25 20:57:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think with your markov model, you should have the simulation end when you're orgasm <= to 1.0
2014-07-25 20:57:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since that's when sex ends for us
2014-07-25 20:58:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean >=
2014-07-25 21:24:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I agree ;)
2014-07-25 22:30:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, my description didn't say that. My implementation had it that way.
2014-07-25 22:43:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The men's and women's bathrooms have their sinks across from each other with no separation at this place I'm at.
2014-07-25 22:44:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like where the mirror would be there is no wall, so you are just looking at the sink area of the opposite sex's bathroom.
2014-07-26 00:01:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got out of the movie. So good!
2014-07-26 00:04:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Heck yeah.
2014-07-26 00:05:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're so much sexier than all the girls at these bars!
2014-07-26 00:05:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish I could've watched the second one with you 
2014-07-26 00:05:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)))))
2014-07-26 00:05:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're too sweet
2014-07-26 00:06:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you still having fun?
2014-07-26 00:07:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah for sure. I like hanging out with my cousin. And we'll have a Godfather marathon suggest.
2014-07-26 07:25:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Made it through the night
2014-07-26 09:25:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yay! I'm struggling a bit, haha.
2014-07-26 09:36:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not surprising, sounds like you had a fun night :)

2014-07-26 09:42:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a minor setback this morning
2014-07-26 09:42:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What happened?
2014-07-26 09:42:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Involving duck tape on the bottom of the car
2014-07-26 09:43:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll tell you later. I'm gonna try to get sme in right now 
2014-07-26 09:43:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did something fall off?
2014-07-26 09:46:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, because I taped it up haha
2014-07-26 10:18:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My cousin's shower has a removable shower head and a little spot to sit ;)
2014-07-26 10:18:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or do you lie down?
2014-07-26 10:42:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If there's no spot to sit, I lie down. Or sometimes sit with my back to the back of the tub
2014-07-26 10:45:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll show you sometime 
2014-07-26 10:53:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK.
2014-07-26 10:53:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have you ever had a guy participate with you?
2014-07-26 11:01:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nope
2014-07-26 11:02:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nor used a sex toy on me
2014-07-26 11:09:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Well I think that'd be fun.
2014-07-26 11:34:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At a farmers market- so many free samples!
2014-07-26 11:52:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I bet you're loving that :)
2014-07-26 12:06:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of course
2014-07-26 12:07:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we can have a removable shower head in our apt next year :)
2014-07-26 12:11:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to today?
2014-07-26 12:13:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Walking to get some brunch in D.C.!
2014-07-26 12:17:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmmm brunch
2014-07-26 12:18:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They had an hour wait :+
2014-07-26 12:18:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:(
2014-07-26 12:18:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was pretty excited about it too. My cousin said they had homemade pop tarts
2014-07-26 12:25:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aww, I know how to make those! We'll do some in Chicago
2014-07-26 12:27:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D

2014-07-26 12:32:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Trying to find a campground on a Saturday is tricky
2014-07-26 12:33:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We may be back to walmarts
2014-07-26 13:02:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like you'd like the coffee shop I'm at right now.
2014-07-26 13:14:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it Christian? Haha
2014-07-26 13:15:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In debating if napping in Starbucks is kosher right now 
2014-07-26 13:38:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nah. My cousin is pretty into food/drink, though. I think y'all would get along.
2014-07-26 13:38:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And you should totally go for the nap.
2014-07-26 13:39:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate retroactively writing this blog
2014-07-26 13:39:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's so harddddd
2014-07-26 13:39:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To remember 
2014-07-26 13:41:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? I'm sure you could use some poetic license on the details.
2014-07-26 13:43:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it's probably more important that I organize that info for myself now
2014-07-26 13:46:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good point.
2014-07-27 17:36:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kicking it with this bunny

2014-07-28 16:13:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]First time at the gym in two weeks and I am FEELING IT.
2014-07-28 17:19:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh
2014-07-28 17:19:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm at goodwill with Dev
2014-07-28 17:20:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice, getting anything?
2014-07-28 17:20:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some shorts and a sweater
2014-07-28 17:20:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-07-28 17:20:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wanted loose comfy pants though
2014-07-28 17:21:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn
2014-07-28 17:22:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you got plans for the evening?
2014-07-28 17:22:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Staying with a friend of devins, maybe going to a bar or something
2014-07-28 17:22:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool cool
2014-07-28 17:41:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Jordan's friend is out for the next few weeks I guess.
2014-07-28 18:05:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think cam found some 
2014-07-28 18:06:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool.
2014-07-28 18:11:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Should we ask him to join us?
2014-07-28 18:11:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Michael! That was unnecessary 
2014-07-28 18:17:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you have a problem with me talking to an ex?
2014-07-28 18:29:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nope. Just a joke!
2014-07-28 18:30:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very funny...
2014-07-28 18:30:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was work today?
2014-07-28 18:32:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fine. My manager posted a couple of comments on one my blog posts that I thought were both kind of condescending and ignorant of the model I'm using haha.
2014-07-28 18:33:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which manager?
2014-07-28 18:33:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Andrew
2014-07-28 18:33:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Boss man.
2014-07-28 18:34:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe he's jealous? Haha
2014-07-28 18:34:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or feels a little threatened 
2014-07-28 18:37:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, I doubt I'm threatening him. I don't know.
2014-07-28 18:37:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe it wasn't condescending and just ignorant.
2014-07-28 18:37:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So all of the other data science interns have easy performance metric.
2014-07-28 18:37:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]metrics
2014-07-28 18:37:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because they're just doing classification
2014-07-28 18:37:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but my project is generating sales leads
2014-07-28 18:37:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the only way to get a sense of its performance
2014-07-28 18:37:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is for some sales people to use it
2014-07-28 18:38:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-28 18:38:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you know?
2014-07-28 18:38:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Makes sense
2014-07-28 18:38:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but he told me to try some simpler models last week
2014-07-28 18:38:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I told you about that
2014-07-28 18:38:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or maybe it was two weeks ago
2014-07-28 18:38:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I made the simple models and said it's not really easy to get a sense of the performance without real world use
2014-07-28 18:39:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he left a comment today saying something like "can't you look at historical data"
2014-07-28 18:39:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so, if it was a classification problem, that would make sense
2014-07-28 18:39:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's obviously how you would test it
2014-07-28 18:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I went ahead and got the classification performance metrics anyway,
2014-07-28 18:40:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I provided the caveat that they don't necessarily indicate how they would perform generating sales' leads
2014-07-28 18:40:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](but my model wrecked the other models anyway, for the record)
2014-07-28 18:41:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the other thing he told me was to look at like individual variables
2014-07-28 18:41:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I had sort of done some visual comparisons between high prob and low prob accounts for the different variables
2014-07-28 18:41:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I said that I didn't really like doing those things in the post
2014-07-28 18:41:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because the interactions are often more informative
2014-07-28 18:42:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but his comment was something like "you can figure out which individual variables are most important and focus on those"
2014-07-28 18:42:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is exactly the opposite of what I was trying to convey
2014-07-28 18:42:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-07-28 18:42:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I went ahead and replied with the probabilities for each individual variable
2014-07-28 18:42:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which was essentially what he was asking for
2014-07-28 18:42:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but then provided a very explicit example
2014-07-28 18:43:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where if you just looked at all the variables independently
2014-07-28 18:43:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or even just the one variable for this particular instance that gave it the highest probability
2014-07-28 18:43:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would still be lower than if you considered the interactions via the Bayesian network
2014-07-28 18:43:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so, for the example, there was an account that had like a 0.9999 probability of having Satellite
2014-07-28 18:44:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the highest individual variable would have only gave it a 0.89
2014-07-28 18:44:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and 22 out of 26 variables would have given it a probability of less than 0.5
2014-07-28 18:44:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I tried to spell that out in my comment
2014-07-28 18:44:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so hopefully that makes sense to him
2014-07-28 20:10:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you ever meet with him in person?
2014-07-28 20:12:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry, I was driving for a while and couldn't read that until now
2014-07-28 20:35:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Going to see Dawn of the Planet of the Apes tonight!
2014-07-28 22:41:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to?
2014-07-28 22:59:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Watching American History X.
2014-07-28 23:10:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you seen it before
2014-07-28 23:10:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-07-28 23:10:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just ended
2014-07-28 23:10:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that shit's messed up
2014-07-28 23:43:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a pretty intriguing movie for sure
2014-07-28 23:44:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you enjoy it?
2014-07-29 00:15:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, maybe you're already asleep. I'm about to go into the movie (quite stoned actually lol). I love you! And miss you
2014-07-29 12:59:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good morning darling 
2014-07-29 13:08:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey what's up?
2014-07-29 13:13:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I loveeee you
2014-07-29 13:13:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're getting ready to go camping by a river 
2014-07-29 13:15:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. That sounds like fun.
2014-07-29 13:20:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, we were feeling a little rough this morning 
2014-07-29 13:23:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? What'd you do last night?
2014-07-29 13:36:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We ate this weed olive oil on some toast, played taboo, and then saw the movie. The oil was quite strong 
2014-07-29 13:37:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice.
2014-07-29 13:47:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think you're still going to try to see the movie this week?
2014-07-29 13:52:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I'm gonna see it tonight.
2014-07-29 14:30:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you'll enjoy it
2014-07-29 20:18:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you're in the movie right now. I left you a little voicemail, I'm going to be without service tonight/half of tomorrow but wanted to send a little message to you first. I miss you so much, I wish you were here too. Devin and her friend are playing eukalele(sp?) and all I can think of is how much better you are on your guitar/banjo! When we go watch the meteor shower you're definitely bringing an instrument out to serenade me :)
2014-07-29 20:19:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you so much! Will call you tomorrow
2014-07-29 20:23:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just got out. Have fun. I love you.
2014-07-30 10:44:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aw I missed you by 4 minutes yesterday!
2014-07-30 10:45:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just drove out to get some ice for my oyster babies 
2014-07-30 11:07:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, word.
2014-07-30 11:07:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was last night?
2014-07-30 13:47:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was fun! Sat around a campfire, ate some vegan sausages/quinoa/chili, and giggled a lot. Then this morning splashed in the freezing cold Salmon River 
2014-07-30 13:47:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On my way back to Portland now
2014-07-30 13:52:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd you like the movie?
2014-07-30 14:00:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely enjoyed it.
2014-07-30 14:01:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah? I thought it was entertaining. The CGI was really impressive 
2014-07-30 14:02:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No doubt. Koba is a mean chimp! But I guess he had a pretty rough life.
2014-07-30 14:06:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I kind of want to rewatch the 1st one and see that character development for him
2014-07-30 14:06:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I don't quite remember what his story was
2014-07-30 14:07:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you!
2014-07-30 14:08:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, I miss you too.
2014-07-30 14:08:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A lot.
2014-07-30 14:09:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to tonight?
2014-07-30 14:11:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not much. What about you?
2014-07-30 14:12:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My plans are very up in the air right now. I'm going to find some wifi and figure stuff out this afternoon. 
2014-07-30 14:13:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool.
2014-07-30 14:27:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maaan, I can't wait to live with you. I'm not ever gonna take seeing you everyday for granted.
2014-07-30 14:28:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Awww
2014-07-30 14:28:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's one positive about starting things off this way.
2014-07-30 14:28:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That they'll only get better?
2014-07-30 14:30:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]More like training me to really value every second we spend together.
2014-07-30 14:31:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-07-30 14:33:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-07-30 14:35:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You going to be home by 5:30? Maybe we can try a coffee shop video
2014-07-30 14:37:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably around 6.
2014-07-30 14:37:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all good if you're busy.
2014-07-30 14:37:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We're seeing each other in a couple of weeks!
2014-07-30 14:55:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll see. I feel very without a plan right now and it's stressing me out a bit
2014-07-30 14:57:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-07-30 15:01:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't know where I'm staying tonight or where to go tomorrow 
2014-07-30 15:01:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have no plan!
2014-07-30 15:03:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, well I'm sorry, sugar. I wish I could be there with you and just hang out.
2014-07-30 15:54:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My legs are sore!
2014-07-30 16:00:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can give a mean leg massage
2014-07-30 16:01:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]From lifting?
2014-07-30 16:02:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. More like a lack of lifting.
2014-07-30 16:02:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A leg massage would definitely give me a boner.
2014-07-30 16:05:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like me being in the same room with you right now would give you a boner ;)
2014-07-30 16:05:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-07-30 16:06:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love leg massages, I always ask for them to spend more time on my legs when I get a professional one
2014-07-30 16:06:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well ain't you cocky.
2014-07-30 16:06:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never had a professional massage. I actually don't get much out of them haha.
2014-07-30 16:07:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe because you haven't had a professional one
2014-07-30 16:07:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you don't like the ones I give you?
2014-07-30 16:07:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe.
2014-07-30 16:09:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I liked the one you gave me, but I just like it when you touch me and rub me in general.
2014-07-30 16:10:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-07-30 16:10:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm at this laundromat that's also a bar/cafe
2014-07-30 16:10:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With pinball machines 
2014-07-30 16:11:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very Portland, I'm digging it
2014-07-30 16:11:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that sounds very Portland.
2014-07-30 16:26:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll still be here in 30, we should try to video!
2014-07-30 16:28:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok!
2014-07-30 16:47:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm home.
2014-07-30 16:51:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0xyzj545tc
2014-07-30 16:51:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]k lemme watch this video    😃 
2014-07-30 16:52:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it looks like Chicago too!
2014-07-30 17:53:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I'm in such a blegh mood
2014-07-30 17:54:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm also probably pmsing  😑
2014-07-30 17:54:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it was nice to see your face!
2014-07-30 17:55:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good. I hope you feel better soon.
2014-07-30 18:28:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a place to sleep tonight, a place to dissect, and I think I have a plan for Aug 5-12.
2014-07-30 18:28:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I feel a little more in control of things 
2014-07-30 18:32:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's good.
2014-07-30 18:32:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Where are you staying?
2014-07-30 18:32:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At Devin's friend's place
2014-07-30 18:33:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-07-30 18:33:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not with her boyfriends family
2014-07-30 18:33:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm gonna try to meet up with Dina tomorrow in Seattle
2014-07-30 18:35:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just so ready to be home
2014-07-30 18:36:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I think the fact that "home" is a bunch of boxes and strange furniture is also like a hidden stress for me right now
2014-07-30 18:36:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know?
2014-07-30 18:37:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that makes sense.
2014-07-30 18:37:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't get to just relax when you go home.
2014-07-30 18:38:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll have someone to help me though :)
2014-07-30 18:38:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-07-30 18:38:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hopefully you'll be able to relax once that's all taken care of
2014-07-30 18:39:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess going to Montana a week after you get to Chicago probably isn't helping
2014-07-30 18:40:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure you're sick of travelling
2014-07-30 18:40:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or at least want a break
2014-07-30 18:41:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My excitement about traveling with you way outweighs travel fatigue
2014-07-30 18:41:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good    😃 
2014-07-30 18:41:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It does make me really not feel like planning that trip though lol 
2014-07-30 18:41:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you can definitely have the window seat
2014-07-30 18:42:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:D
2014-07-30 18:42:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as long as I can lean over you    😉 
2014-07-30 18:43:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't mind planning the trip, but I need to know what you want to do I guess.
2014-07-30 18:44:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-07-30 18:45:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We need to figure out who's picking us up from the airport or if we need to find a hotel to stay in the 1st night 
2014-07-30 18:45:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty sure Justin is under the impression he is in charge of us
2014-07-30 18:46:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I never gave him any indication that wasn't the case
2014-07-30 18:46:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he already asked me what time our flight was back
2014-07-30 18:46:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because he thinks he's taking us back
2014-07-30 18:46:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So has he planned to pick us up?
2014-07-30 18:46:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't asked him explicitly
2014-07-30 18:46:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm assuming he is
2014-07-30 18:46:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he thinks we are staying with him the whole time
2014-07-30 18:47:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I thought that's what was happening
2014-07-30 18:47:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]originally
2014-07-30 18:50:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to stay with Elin at least one night
2014-07-30 18:51:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-07-30 18:52:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe tell him were also visiting my best friend who lives like an hour from him
2014-07-30 18:52:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And see what kind if stuff he was planning on doing/showing us
2014-07-30 18:52:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-07-30 18:58:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so do you know what you're gonna do until the 5th?
2014-07-30 18:58:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-07-30 18:59:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Justin said he was just planning on being our tour guide for whatever we wanted to do.
2014-07-30 18:59:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Soo I mean it's whatever.
2014-07-30 19:00:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He just sent this: "Of course I have some great hikes in mind, and I'd love to get you guys up to Glacier Nat park at some point. I have a volunteer pass that will get us in free, and of course her friend is welcome to come too"
2014-07-30 19:15:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I floated the idea of getting us all in a group Hangout or Facebook messaging at some point to Justin and he thinks it's a good idea
2014-07-30 19:15:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe like a week or so before we visit
2014-07-30 21:43:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure
2014-07-30 21:44:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you and I should talk more about the visit first? You're making it sound like you don't want to split time between seeing them
2014-07-30 21:45:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or that you intended this to be mostly a visit to justin when I misunderstood that we were visiting both of them
2014-07-31 11:34:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a very sexualized dream about you last night
2014-07-31 13:25:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha oh yeah? What does that mean?
2014-07-31 13:49:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We were just having a lot of sex
2014-07-31 13:49:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]After a dramatic escape from a witch that looked like Katy Perry trying to control everyone's mind's
2014-07-31 13:50:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-07-31 13:50:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You were wearing jeans and shirtless for most of it
2014-07-31 13:50:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like an adventure!
2014-07-31 13:51:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha that's awesome.
2014-07-31 13:51:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm guessing you like that look?
2014-07-31 13:53:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybeeee :)
2014-07-31 13:55:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was your night besides the dream?
2014-07-31 13:56:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good. I dissected oysters with Dev's bf's 11 yr old niece helping me, and then played some more taboo and chilled until midnight 
2014-07-31 13:56:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At a little coffee shop now
2014-07-31 13:57:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's you do?
2014-07-31 13:58:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not much. Watched Sin City.
2014-07-31 14:04:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So are you staying there for the next few nights?
2014-07-31 14:42:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-07-31 14:43:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you being snarky? 
2014-07-31 14:43:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying to go up to Seattle area but haven't heard from Dina
2014-07-31 14:44:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm not really sure what the deal is
2014-07-31 16:55:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP].....
2014-07-31 17:05:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's up?
2014-07-31 17:11:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's up with you?
2014-07-31 17:12:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you getting annoyed with the poor texting?
2014-07-31 18:35:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if you want I can call you in like 30 min
2014-07-31 18:35:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or we can talk another day
2014-07-31 18:36:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-07-31 18:40:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can call you in 30 min?
2014-07-31 18:44:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just got some of your messages.
2014-07-31 18:44:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm at Back Porch Music and don't have minutes.
2014-07-31 18:45:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you going off the grid again or something?
2014-07-31 19:01:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm driving to my cousins, will get there at like 7:15p
2014-07-31 19:02:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK.
2014-07-31 19:02:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just wanted to check in
2014-07-31 19:04:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool. Check in acknowledged? Haha
2014-07-31 19:04:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K have a goodnight 
2014-07-31 19:05:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you not free tonight?
2014-07-31 19:07:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am while I'm driving
2014-07-31 19:08:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, but not at your cousin's?
2014-07-31 19:09:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to eat dinner with them and catch up since I haven't seen her in like a decade
2014-07-31 19:10:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK. That's cool. Have fun!
2014-07-31 19:38:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You too 
2014-07-31 20:27:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm home if you want to talk.
2014-07-31 21:18:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Snapchat is not a legitimate way to continue a conversation my dear haha
2014-07-31 21:18:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I liked the kissy fave
2014-07-31 21:23:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we should limit texting during this time of the month
2014-07-31 21:24:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or make a rule you aren't allowed to get snarky 
2014-07-31 21:24:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only me :)
2014-07-31 21:24:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess I don't feel like I've been all that snarky.
2014-07-31 21:25:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We just haven't really talked much.
2014-07-31 21:25:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I'll try harder.
2014-07-31 21:25:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're bummed because we haven't talked much the last few days?
2014-07-31 21:26:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, obviously!
2014-07-31 21:27:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I mean, it's fine.
2014-07-31 21:27:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't realize I was being snarky if that was the case.
2014-07-31 21:27:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Word." Was kind of 
2014-07-31 21:28:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh yeah, no doubt.
2014-07-31 21:28:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it was meant to be funny too I guess?
2014-07-31 21:32:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't want to feel bad about not talking to you when I do the best I can 
2014-07-31 21:33:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just don't even worry about talking to me
2014-07-31 21:33:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you're busy
2014-07-31 21:34:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I talk to you when I can and because I want to
2014-07-31 21:35:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I can go from not busy to busy quickly and don't always have time to give you warning
2014-07-31 21:35:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's not really talking
2014-07-31 21:35:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in my opinion
2014-07-31 21:35:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not conversation
2014-07-31 21:36:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well you try to make it convo
2014-07-31 21:36:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm just not into it
2014-07-31 21:36:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd rather you send snaps or something
2014-07-31 21:37:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhhh I suggested something like that when I tried to delete hangouts and you didn't want that
2014-07-31 21:37:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You said we would both change out expectations about texting 
2014-07-31 21:38:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you said no texting
2014-07-31 21:38:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then you started again
2014-07-31 21:39:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We talked on the phone and you said you still wanted to text 
2014-07-31 21:40:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, well I do like it when we have convos over text
2014-07-31 21:40:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm not really interested in these like hour between response convos
2014-07-31 21:41:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that seems to bother you
2014-07-31 21:41:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that I'm not into it
2014-07-31 21:41:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean, I don't honestly know what I did wrong here
2014-07-31 21:41:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]besides say "word"
2014-07-31 21:42:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm clearly not mad at you
2014-07-31 21:48:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I will avoid starting or actively continuing conversations before I'm about to drive or work or spend time with someone
2014-07-31 21:49:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you don't get nonplussed 
2014-07-31 21:49:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good
2014-07-31 21:51:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think you really want to start a snap back and forth about weird things that can be done with genitalia 
2014-07-31 21:51:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might win 
2014-07-31 21:52:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-07-31 21:52:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think you can one up that?
2014-07-31 21:53:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] I guess I just don't think you want me to try lol
2014-07-31 21:53:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha yeah actually you're probably right
2014-07-31 21:54:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, I'm almost there. So will go radio silent now
2014-07-31 21:55:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight darling
2014-07-31 21:55:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight. I love you.
2014-07-31 21:55:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you too
2014-07-31 21:56:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry I'm cranky
2014-07-31 21:56:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's ok. You're MY cranky girlfriend and I couldn't be luckier to have ya    😉 
2014-07-31 21:58:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if that sentence makes sense.
2014-07-31 21:58:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I couldn't be luckier... full stop.
2014-07-31 21:59:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It did 
2014-07-31 21:59:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To me
2014-07-31 21:59:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha cool
2014-08-01 13:25:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Any desire to see guardians of the galaxy in Chicago? 
2014-08-01 14:03:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sure! Odds on that happening? Haha
2014-08-01 14:03:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We saw Snowpiercer 
2014-08-01 14:03:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we've only had one failed movie seeing attempt lol
2014-08-01 14:04:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You make it sound like we never make it out of the house ;)
2014-08-01 14:06:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fucking Chick-fil-A closes at 2:30!
2014-08-01 14:07:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, the chickfila's in that city are whack
2014-08-01 14:10:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I applied for a SWA credit card. If I spend $2000 in 3 months I get 2 free round trip flights on top of the one I almost have now!
2014-08-01 14:13:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice! Is that just for the first three months?
2014-08-01 14:14:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, but you get 6000 mi on your anniversary every year, miles for $$ spent, and no foreign transaction fees.
2014-08-01 14:15:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My BOA has foreign fees that were killer in CR
2014-08-01 14:16:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. So how do miles work?
2014-08-01 14:16:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You use them to get free flights usually, but also can use them when renting cars/hotel rooms
2014-08-01 14:17:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So miles don't equal miles flights or they do?
2014-08-01 14:18:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not really for purchasing flights with them 
2014-08-01 14:18:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But the way I've gotten the flights I have is based on how long the flights I've flown we're
2014-08-01 14:18:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*were
2014-08-01 14:25:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So miles are like points?
2014-08-01 14:26:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like 6000 miles don't equate to 6000 miles of free flights.
2014-08-01 15:18:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Correct
2014-08-01 15:19:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's that concert we're going to? I was gonna tell Diego, but fucking Hangouts doesn't let you search.
2014-08-01 15:32:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Diego?
2014-08-01 15:32:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's Robyn and Royksopp
2014-08-01 15:32:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry my cousin started talking to me so delayed texting
2014-08-01 15:33:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My Red Hat coworker who was gonna try to hook us up.
2014-08-01 15:34:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah
2014-08-01 15:36:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. He's pretty cool. We'd probably start hanging out if I wasn't leaving next week haha.
2014-08-01 16:48:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you go to lunch with him?
2014-08-01 16:51:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not intentionally. He came into the little eating area while I was having lunch so we talked for a while.
2014-08-01 16:53:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm glad you're so happy with my cards /:)
2014-08-01 16:54:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love them, you have no idea.
2014-08-01 16:54:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I love that you send them to me!
2014-08-01 16:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can feel your love through them.
2014-08-01 16:56:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So much love. That's why I send them 
2014-08-01 16:57:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-08-01 16:59:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's pretty wild/amazing how I can sort of "feel" you through the postcard.
2014-08-01 16:59:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know that's not really a new idea, but it's still interesting to think about.
2014-08-01 17:00:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like I can sort of construct this representation of you in my head as I'm reading it, to the point that it tricks my brain into almost thinking you're present.
2014-08-01 17:02:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😻
2014-08-01 17:02:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-08-01 17:02:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the perfect emoji for you
2014-08-01 17:02:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, I try to only save it for when I'm really happy
2014-08-01 17:03:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha aw
2014-08-01 17:04:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you doing tonight?

2014-08-01 17:04:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When do you think you'll be back 
2014-08-01 17:04:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's about an hour and a half away
2014-08-01 17:04:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Umm 11:30
2014-08-01 17:05:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe?

2014-08-01 17:06:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Watching cable

2014-08-01 17:14:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You look like a 70s porn star (in a good way)
2014-08-01 17:23:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-08-01 17:23:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll take it!
2014-08-01 17:26:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe time for a haircut soon though..., :)
2014-08-01 17:27:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I was wondering how you'd feel about it.
2014-08-01 17:27:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How short do you think I should cut it?
2014-08-01 17:28:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not completely buzzed
2014-08-01 22:00:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How did you do that???
2014-08-01 22:00:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't crash and drive darling
2014-08-01 22:06:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or rather crash and die from snapchatting and driving
2014-08-01 22:07:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do what? The live video?
2014-08-01 22:09:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah!
2014-08-01 22:11:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was in a loud restaurant, so it kind of startled me
2014-08-01 22:13:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I wasn't sure if you saw it. If we're both in chat at the same time the yellow button turns blue and if you hold it down it's live video.
2014-08-01 22:13:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ah I see
2014-08-01 22:13:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Could you see me?
2014-08-01 22:14:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No that's why I wasn't sure if it was working. I don't know if you have to hold down something too.
2014-08-01 22:15:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably
2014-08-01 22:15:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What time will you be home?
2014-08-01 22:17:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Half an hour?
2014-08-01 22:17:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmk, I'll probably be home in like 45

2014-08-01 22:18:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!

2014-08-01 22:20:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I love you too!
2014-08-01 22:20:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had one of those buzzy lovey happy feeling steal over me
2014-08-01 22:21:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww :)
2014-08-01 22:22:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I missed you at the concert.
2014-08-01 22:24:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It looked pretty awesome and definitely up my ally
2014-08-01 22:24:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might need to listen to her more
2014-08-01 22:25:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got a concert T-shirt.
2014-08-01 22:25:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The average age was probably 60
2014-08-01 22:27:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you get both videos?
2014-08-01 22:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha my baby brother used #igotothetheatrealone on Facebook.
2014-08-01 23:04:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Back Porch Music is really bluesy tonight.

2014-08-02 02:25:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That was a pretty epic chat session!
2014-08-02 02:28:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know!
2014-08-02 02:29:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]3 hours, not quite our record but not too shabby 
2014-08-02 02:29:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love when time flies by like that with you
2014-08-02 02:29:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too :)
2014-08-02 02:30:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's like we enjoy each other's company or something.
2014-08-02 02:30:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And how you never seem to be the one to hang up on me 
2014-08-02 02:30:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like you never want to stop talking to me or something 
2014-08-02 02:31:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't.
2014-08-02 02:31:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you so much 
2014-08-02 02:32:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too. Sweet dreams, beautiful.
2014-08-02 13:28:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good morning my love
2014-08-02 13:28:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃  good morning, honey
2014-08-02 13:31:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd you sleep?
2014-08-02 13:31:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you know if other cultures use words based around "sweetness" to refer to people affectionately?
2014-08-02 13:31:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not bad
2014-08-02 13:31:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how about you?
2014-08-02 13:32:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]any more epic sex dreams?
2014-08-02 13:33:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, I'd be curios to find out though
2014-08-02 13:33:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I slept pretty well, and was having some dream I was enjoying when the comcast guy called me at 8:00a -_-
2014-08-02 13:34:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]booo

2014-08-02 13:40:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will you remove my fleas? 
2014-08-02 13:40:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]every last one    😃 
2014-08-02 13:43:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A lot of them do seem to do with foodstuff 
2014-08-02 13:43:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I noticed that too.
2014-08-02 13:43:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe I should come up with one for you.
2014-08-02 13:43:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My oyster.
2014-08-02 13:44:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My pearl.
2014-08-02 13:45:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like pearly
2014-08-02 13:45:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*pearl
2014-08-02 13:45:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I don't know if I'd ever use it conversation, though
2014-08-02 13:45:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think rarely use terms of endearment when we're together
2014-08-02 13:47:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm ok with that
2014-08-02 13:48:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-08-02 13:48:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just rarely even address you directly
2014-08-02 13:49:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm
2014-08-02 13:49:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you're right, I've never thought about it
2014-08-02 13:53:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've always thought "Katie" wasn't a particularly sexy name to say in the middle of sex
2014-08-02 13:54:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if that's because the situation never arises or because you told me I can't use "baby"
2014-08-02 13:54:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I guess I've never really been one to say names during sex.
2014-08-02 13:55:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't remember any of my exes ever saying my name during sex.
2014-08-02 13:59:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So "baby" is a term of endearment you would use more often in person if I hadn't said that? 
2014-08-02 14:03:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. That's what I'm wondering. I used it fairly often in previous relationships. It's what comes most naturally to me for some reason.
2014-08-02 14:05:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well Katie rhymes with baby lol
2014-08-02 14:08:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah I guess that'll work.
2014-08-02 14:12:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it strengthens my feelings about it that it was a word you used for all your other relationships for some reason 
2014-08-02 14:14:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I think I might've only said one other person 's name during sex ever in retrospect 
2014-08-02 14:16:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? That's pretty interesting. Do you have any idea where it comes from?
2014-08-02 14:17:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And one of the main reasons I don't mind you not liking "baby" is because I used it in past relationships, so we're on the same page with that.
2014-08-02 14:20:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It doesn't feel very personable 
2014-08-02 14:21:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My question was regarding names during sex.
2014-08-02 14:24:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh, I dunno. I never had the desire/feeling to say names
2014-08-02 14:25:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I have a ton of conscious control over what comes out of my mouth during sex lol
2014-08-02 14:25:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I can dig that
2014-08-02 14:35:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In the Netherlands we call babies or little children poepie ("little poop"), scheetje ("little fart") or droppie ("little liquorice") when we think they look cute. Dutchy, Netherlands
2014-08-02 14:36:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My scheetje!
2014-08-02 14:36:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha

2014-08-02 14:41:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty interesting, if true
2014-08-02 14:46:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kind of makes sense, but I bet it varies quite a lot between people, especially once your tolerance changes 
2014-08-02 14:50:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What app do you use on your phone for reddit?
2014-08-02 14:50:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Reddit News, but it's only for Android
2014-08-02 14:50:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]everyone with an iPhone uses Alien Blue
2014-08-02 15:05:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's TIFU?
2014-08-02 15:05:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Today I Fucked Up
2014-08-02 15:06:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not subscribed to that one
2014-08-02 15:54:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I hung up on you
2014-08-02 15:55:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You were upsetting me a lot, maybe we can talk about this again later
2014-08-02 20:41:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My headphones weren't plugged in.
2014-08-02 20:43:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're frozen.
2014-08-02 20:44:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So are you
2014-08-02 20:44:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think the internet is extra shitty right now
2014-08-02 20:45:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm yeah looking that way
2014-08-02 21:05:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://chicago.cbslocal.com/top-lists/best-places-for-stargazing-in-chicago/
2014-08-02 21:25:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you call?
2014-08-02 21:25:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It said I was in a video for some reason
2014-08-02 21:25:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-08-02 21:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry you're feeling down
2014-08-02 21:28:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm probably just taking offhanded comments of yours too seriously.
2014-08-02 21:28:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think you were understanding the point I was trying to make.
2014-08-02 21:29:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But ti doesn't really matter.
2014-08-02 21:29:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Should probably just avoid that stuff.
2014-08-02 21:30:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"That stuff" is really important to me. And I'm worried that we may differ significantly in our opinions on the state of gender equality in the world now and how it should be dealt with. 
2014-08-02 21:31:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We don't have to talk about it now, but it's definitely not something I'm ok with pushing under the rug forever
2014-08-02 21:31:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well, if it's that important to you, shouldn't you want it sorted out sooner than later?
2014-08-02 21:31:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't want to talk about it
2014-08-02 21:32:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Let's talk about it
2014-08-02 21:32:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can talk about it in person
2014-08-02 21:32:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]k
2014-08-02 21:33:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm curious how you think I feel about gender equality
2014-08-02 21:33:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because your email had nothing to do with the point I was making
2014-08-02 21:34:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The point that we should have a science set with both men and women? Because a mom will never buy that set for her son?
2014-08-02 21:34:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because if we're trying to teach our kids that gender doesn't matter
2014-08-02 21:35:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]than why wouldn't we be bundling sets of men and women scientists together
2014-08-02 21:35:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the kids are playing with boy and girl scientists together
2014-08-02 21:35:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and learning that that is normal
2014-08-02 21:35:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but fuck me
2014-08-02 21:35:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm a misogynist
2014-08-02 21:35:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All the Legos were "yellow" too
2014-08-02 21:35:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]by the way
2014-08-02 21:35:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so sucks to be a black girl!
2014-08-02 21:37:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would obviously love the world to be color and gender blind
2014-08-02 21:37:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know what you're right I never want to have this discussion with you again
2014-08-02 21:41:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was mean, and unnecessarily so. I never called you a misogynist and don't think you are one- you didn't give me the chance to explain my concerns.
2014-08-02 21:49:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we should just stick to fucking and going on adventures and stay away from serious conversations 
2014-08-02 21:50:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-08-02 21:50:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's what you want?
2014-08-02 21:53:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've suggested it a few times and I'm giving it some consideration now
2014-08-02 21:53:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when have I ever suggested that?
2014-08-02 21:53:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In Costa Rica
2014-08-02 21:54:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]After some talk about banking prejudice
2014-08-02 21:54:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]After a conversation about heroin legalization 
2014-08-02 21:58:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not that your ideas are particularly revolutionary or against mine, I think they're at heart pretty on par. It's that you form reactionary opinions of a subject before getting all the information and will doggedly argue your point without listening to the other perspective.
2014-08-02 22:03:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think my opinions are reactionary.
2014-08-02 22:03:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I don't listen to the other perspective.
2014-08-02 22:03:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I asked you to sum up my argument for why we need more female minifigures and why I support that set, I don't know if you could. At least not without saying things like "just for feminist women to get their daughters to become scientists"
2014-08-02 22:03:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You want to "even things out"
2014-08-02 22:04:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You think there are too few female Lego toys
2014-08-02 22:04:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]particularly in certain careers
2014-08-02 22:06:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And didn't my email address that point? But you dismissed my email because it did not argue against  your  point
2014-08-02 22:06:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude, what?
2014-08-02 22:06:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you hung up on me!
2014-08-02 22:06:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]because your email had nothing to do with the point I was making
2014-08-02 22:07:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry.
2014-08-02 22:07:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hung up on you because you insinuated only feminist mothers would support their daughters being scientists, and you say feminist like a dirty word
2014-08-02 22:07:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't realize I wasn't listening to your perspective.
2014-08-02 22:08:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. I thought the point I was making that a set that had both boy and girl scientists would be be better for kids whose parents want them to be scientists.
2014-08-02 22:09:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And let's throw in some minorities as well.
2014-08-02 22:09:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because if we're gonna be manipulating our children into a certain way of thinking, I think that would be the best way to do it.
2014-08-02 22:09:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I wasn't conveying that properly.
2014-08-02 22:09:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You did 
2014-08-02 22:09:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got that entirely 
2014-08-02 22:10:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ignoring the minority thing for a second 
2014-08-02 22:12:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The set was made for girls to play with because there are no sets of just girls
2014-08-02 22:12:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*girl figures
2014-08-02 22:13:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We don't have a problem with boys and girls playing well together
2014-08-02 22:13:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't understand how that sends a better message than a set with say two women scientists and one man scientist
2014-08-02 22:13:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess I need to broaden my worldview
2014-08-02 22:14:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A girl playing with the set will not grow up thinking only women should be scientists
2014-08-02 22:15:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-08-02 22:15:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems to promote a sense of "otherness"
2014-08-02 22:15:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still
2014-08-02 22:15:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but maybe I'm misguided again
2014-08-02 22:15:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and boys are still not playing with girl scientists
2014-08-02 22:15:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The profusion of male doctors, science teachers, college professors, actors who portray scientists will rectify that 
2014-08-02 22:15:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which furthers the otherness
2014-08-02 22:16:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess my viewpoints don't really have any evidence to support them
2014-08-02 22:16:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so maybe the three girl scientist thing is the way to do it
2014-08-02 22:16:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sorry I was dismissive
2014-08-02 22:17:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a starting step. One day hopefully we can have 50/50 Legos of all types 
2014-08-02 22:17:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A point I made in my email
2014-08-02 22:17:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But first we need to even things out a little
2014-08-02 22:18:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially when so many other elements in the world are slowing down equality
2014-08-02 22:20:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The way to change how men view women so they see them more as equals is not going to happen through subtle Lego manipulation 
2014-08-02 22:20:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it works on girls
2014-08-02 22:22:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well girls are just more manipulative I guess 
2014-08-02 22:22:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*easily manipulated
2014-08-02 22:24:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A bad joke
2014-08-02 22:26:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K well I'm sure you're over this conversation
2014-08-02 22:26:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I am too
2014-08-02 22:26:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-08-02 23:07:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wish I was there with you right now 
2014-08-02 23:10:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need some Michael lovin'
2014-08-02 23:12:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'd actually be a pretty good experiment for our relationship.
2014-08-02 23:13:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This is definitely our worst moment I'd say.
2014-08-02 23:13:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I'm not feeling particularly loving.
2014-08-02 23:14:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I wonder what kind of effect would that have on us.
2014-08-02 23:15:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you upset with me? Or at how I've been acting? 
2014-08-02 23:15:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or just the situation/vibe in general?
2014-08-02 23:16:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess all of it?
2014-08-02 23:16:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean, I'm not mad at you obviously.
2014-08-02 23:17:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I don't feel super loving like I usually do I guess.
2014-08-02 23:19:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, if we had had our initial conversation in person: you would've noticed I was on the verge of tears, I wouldn't have been able to hang up on you, we would've talked it out then and there, and not have resorted to sending and interpreting text comments 
2014-08-02 23:20:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'd like to think it wouldn't have gotten to this point
2014-08-02 23:20:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I agree 100%.
2014-08-02 23:21:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we've had our first official fight
2014-08-02 23:23:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha pretty sure you're right.
2014-08-02 23:23:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll put it on the calendar.
2014-08-02 23:24:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll make sure to put it was started by Legos too.
2014-08-02 23:24:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fucking stupid pieces of plastic 
2014-08-02 23:25:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha truth.
2014-08-02 23:25:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol what were those emoji supposed to represent?
2014-08-02 23:25:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are we having a fiesta?
2014-08-02 23:25:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Congratulations!
2014-08-02 23:25:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've had your first fight!
2014-08-02 23:25:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How does it feel?
2014-08-02 23:26:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that's what I thought.
2014-08-02 23:26:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In like a talk show host voice
2014-08-02 23:26:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You've just had your first fight. What are you going to do next?
2014-08-02 23:26:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We're going to Disney World!
2014-08-02 23:26:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-08-02 23:28:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still am curious how we'd act in person, but you're already making me feel better just over Hangouts, so I have a feeling you'd be even more effective in person.
2014-08-02 23:29:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We have the rest of our lives to discover what an in-person fight is like
2014-08-02 23:30:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-08-02 23:30:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That is, if you still want to marry me and be the father of my children and all that jazz
2014-08-02 23:30:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I promise, we can buy the men and women Lego packs and mix them together before giving them to the kids
2014-08-02 23:31:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha deal.
2014-08-02 23:31:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I do.
2014-08-02 23:31:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The fucking and adventures thing hurt my feelings pretty good.
2014-08-02 23:31:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So congrats on that haha
2014-08-02 23:32:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hurt my own feelings with that
2014-08-02 23:32:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw :(
2014-08-02 23:32:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know I love you for so much more than just those things
2014-08-02 23:33:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I guess it still hurt to have you say it, though.
2014-08-02 23:34:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Something about your tone in the comments right before, or in the tone I interpreted them in really upset me
2014-08-02 23:35:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not that that's really a good excuse for being petty like that
2014-08-02 23:36:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I was pretty antagonist at the end of that thought.
2014-08-02 23:36:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And really, you're the best man I've ever met! You truly want equality and fair treatment of everyone on the planet! How can I get mad at you for those desires?
2014-08-02 23:36:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Antagonistic
2014-08-02 23:37:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got caught up in my own opinion  too
2014-08-02 23:37:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*Opinion of how to reach those goals 
2014-08-02 23:38:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I guess this type of thing was probably bound to happen with our personality types.
2014-08-02 23:39:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we'll be able to better manage these types of situations in person.
2014-08-02 23:39:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And with some practice
2014-08-02 23:39:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah for sure.
2014-08-02 23:41:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could never say that phrase to you in person
2014-08-02 23:41:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure of that 
2014-08-02 23:44:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I'm still crazy about ya and think I'm the luckiest dude on the planet to have you as my girlfriend and life exploration partner.
2014-08-02 23:45:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good
2014-08-02 23:45:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ditto to the above
2014-08-02 23:47:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wish I was there to kiss you're slightly unwilling face and rub your slightly unloving head and make this all better, but I think sleep will help out it behind us
2014-08-02 23:47:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I do feel much better now
2014-08-02 23:48:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good.
2014-08-02 23:49:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you with all of my heart.
2014-08-02 23:52:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I sent you some pretty pitiful snaps
2014-08-02 23:53:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight my love 
2014-08-02 23:55:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I loved them, especially the video.
2014-08-03 00:17:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.tlc.com/tv-shows/sex-sent-me-to-the-er
2014-08-03 08:12:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol that was so goofy. That sounds terrible, though.
2014-08-03 08:15:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They obviously consider a hand job sex too.
2014-08-03 09:12:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you love me enough to give me a hand job if I was at the hospital?
2014-08-03 11:55:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That show was on last night 
2014-08-03 11:55:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely goofy
2014-08-03 11:56:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know if my love for you should be measured by my willingness to give you hand jobs  
2014-08-03 11:56:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]...but if probably do it anyways
2014-08-03 11:57:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-08-03 11:57:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think hand jobs are the perfect measure
2014-08-03 12:17:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd you sleep?
2014-08-03 12:18:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok how about you?
2014-08-03 12:22:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hard, with lots of slightly unsettling dreams
2014-08-03 12:23:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah? how so?
2014-08-03 12:24:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like one where I was graduating college (but it took place at my old elementary school) and I realized I had forgotten to turn any grad applications in and I was running through the halls crying 
2014-08-03 12:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's such a dream scenario!
2014-08-03 12:30:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I know
2014-08-03 12:31:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And when I woke up I was confused where I was, and then realized "oh yeah, I'm on a field season for grad school"
2014-08-03 12:32:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what should we do with stuff we've done on our list
2014-08-03 12:33:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm either make a "Stuff we've Already Done" List
2014-08-03 12:33:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With pictures!
2014-08-03 12:33:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha or move them to the bottom of their lists with something to mark they've been completed 
2014-08-03 12:34:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm gonna separate the Upcoming list
2014-08-03 12:49:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmk :)
2014-08-03 12:49:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like the picture idea, though.
2014-08-03 12:49:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Assuming we take pictures someday
2014-08-03 12:50:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really want to see the pics from our kayaking adventure
2014-08-03 12:50:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying to use up the camera without just wasting it
2014-08-03 12:50:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I took some when we went camping by the river
2014-08-03 12:51:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool. Yeah, no rush. I'm just eager to see them!
2014-08-03 12:51:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you still massage my feet even if they looked dirt-stained and had bug bites all over? 
2014-08-03 12:51:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a true test if love
2014-08-03 12:52:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-08-03 12:52:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I would
2014-08-03 12:52:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'd have to ask really sweetly, though
2014-08-03 12:52:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can do that!
2014-08-03 12:53:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that what I have to look forward to in Chicago?
2014-08-03 12:53:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just that. I'm only flying my nasty feet home, the rest of me stays here
2014-08-03 12:53:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha nooooo
2014-08-03 12:53:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if only I was a foot fetishist
2014-08-03 12:54:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could give you a foot job. Maybe you'll like it more than you'd expect
2014-08-03 12:55:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-08-03 12:55:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm ok
2014-08-03 12:57:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think they may be a recipe for you to end up on that TV show
2014-08-03 12:58:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-08-03 12:58:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me giving you a foot job
2014-08-03 12:59:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh would send me to the ER?
2014-08-03 12:59:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I'm quite coordinated to pull that off
2014-08-03 12:59:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I think I can overlook that flaw    😉 
2014-08-03 13:32:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Showered and tidied up their apt, now I'm chilling at a coffee shop for a bit
2014-08-03 13:32:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I never ended up watching true detective 
2014-08-03 13:33:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think you're gonna watch it today?
2014-08-03 13:35:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno. I've decided I'm just driving like 2.5 hours to Bellingham, WA and staying in a Walmart there then getting on a ferry Mon morning 
2014-08-03 13:36:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you just gonna be camping in Canada?
2014-08-03 13:36:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't knowww
2014-08-03 13:36:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably, I definitely don't know anyone there
2014-08-03 13:37:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]worddd
2014-08-03 13:38:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my parents asked if they were gonna get to see you
2014-08-03 13:38:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-08-03 13:38:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my mom said she thought about messaging you, but she doesn't want to come across as crazy
2014-08-03 13:38:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I told her that was probably a good idea
2014-08-03 13:40:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Awww she wouldn't, I just don't want to make any promises I might not be able to keep due to extenuating circumstances. I'll message her
2014-08-03 13:41:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's basically what I told them
2014-08-03 13:42:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you!
2014-08-03 13:42:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh man I miss you too!
2014-08-03 13:43:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're getting there, slowly but surely
2014-08-03 13:44:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like when you pick me up from the airport
2014-08-03 13:45:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too
2014-08-03 13:45:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like how you kiss me in the car
2014-08-03 13:48:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:))))
2014-08-03 13:49:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So many kisses so soon!
2014-08-03 13:49:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can't wait
2014-08-03 14:30:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the whole idea of resolving sounds or returning "home" in music is so bonkers
2014-08-03 14:32:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to know how someone who had never been exposed to music would respond to someone playing the first seven notes of a major scale vs. also playing the octave
2014-08-03 14:32:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or any sort of non-resolved vs. resolved melody
2014-08-03 14:33:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They've done those sort of experiments on babies from different cultures with different voice leading tendencies 
2014-08-03 14:33:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think that stuff is crazy interesting too and wish I knew more about it
2014-08-03 14:34:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might have to have you explain the circle of fifths to me
2014-08-03 14:35:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've looked into it before
2014-08-03 14:35:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it just seemed like too much effort to learn for the payoff
2014-08-03 15:06:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha it's not that hard
2014-08-03 15:07:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]bead Greatest Common Factor! 
2014-08-03 15:08:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]their mnemonic was something about Father Christmas haha
2014-08-03 15:08:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't remember that many words
2014-08-03 15:09:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, most of these Canadian spots are only accessible by water taxi 
2014-08-03 15:09:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck
2014-08-03 15:10:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's just not something you want to deal with?
2014-08-03 15:11:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's gonna cost $$$
2014-08-03 15:11:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, that sucks
2014-08-03 15:11:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh I guess that's science for ya 
2014-08-03 15:11:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's the spirit
2014-08-03 15:13:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]An investment in my future!
2014-08-03 15:14:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The way the WA fish and wildlife guy was do excited about this project though was encouraging, I think it definitely will be a paper that at least some people will care about and use 
2014-08-03 15:15:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that'd be cool
2014-08-03 15:16:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah. Maybe I can actually help save the oysters after all
2014-08-03 15:16:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-08-03 15:16:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but only the native ones!
2014-08-03 15:16:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah fuck those Japs man
2014-08-03 15:17:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lolllllllllll
2014-08-03 15:34:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's crazy that the treble and bass clef somehow started out as a G and an F
2014-08-03 16:02:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In pretty good at drawing a treble clef 
2014-08-03 16:02:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nbd
2014-08-03 16:03:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gonna need some proof
2014-08-03 16:22:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that'll be the first thing we do after you get me from the airport    😃 
2014-08-03 16:22:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sorry I'm not being a great texter right now, trying to figure my shit out
2014-08-03 16:23:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Vancouver Island is much larger than it looked on the map......
2014-08-03 16:23:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]getting these oysters might easily cost me another $250
2014-08-03 17:32:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just took a nap haha
2014-08-03 17:33:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's pretty expensive, though :/
2014-08-03 17:38:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'm selling my North Coast ticket 
2014-08-03 17:38:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I have a feeling there are other things we'll be doing first.
2014-08-03 17:38:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So that'll be some money 
2014-08-03 17:38:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh yeah?
2014-08-03 17:38:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Other things?
2014-08-03 17:39:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh from the previous text 
2014-08-03 17:39:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah for sure
2014-08-03 17:41:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Things like taking out the trash, doing the dishes, cumming in your pussy, unpacking boxes, etc.
2014-08-03 17:41:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd prefer you to take out the trash after cumming in my pussy
2014-08-03 17:42:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just in case there are smells  😵
2014-08-03 17:42:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha fiiiiine. I guess I can do that.
2014-08-03 17:49:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to, beautiful? Still figuring things out?
2014-08-03 19:04:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm desperate enough for football that I'm gonna watch at least some of the preseason game that's on tonight.
2014-08-03 19:21:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Preseason for who? Auburn?
2014-08-03 19:21:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah just NFL
2014-08-03 19:21:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Giants vs. Bills
2014-08-03 19:22:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will it be that bad?
2014-08-03 19:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, preseason ball is pretty ugly typically
2014-08-03 19:22:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's basically just glorified practices
2014-08-03 19:28:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My options for places with wifi opened later than 6p were essentially this BBQ place and Denny's
2014-08-03 19:28:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So BBQ it is!
2014-08-03 19:28:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-08-03 19:29:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I've only had BBQ once this summer.
2014-08-03 19:29:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And it was during Evolution
2014-08-03 19:29:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was good BBQ
2014-08-03 19:29:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fo sho
2014-08-03 19:29:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely going to end up spending more money here than I'd like though
2014-08-03 19:29:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In retrospect Denny's might've been better
2014-08-03 19:30:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is it pricey?
2014-08-03 19:30:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or just appealing?
2014-08-03 19:30:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I guess both
2014-08-03 19:31:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty standard pricing for food and beer, but I could've gotten a whole meal at Denny's for $5!
2014-08-03 19:31:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really?
2014-08-03 19:31:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't been to Denny's in a whle.
2014-08-03 19:32:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do they serve beer?
2014-08-03 19:33:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nooo but that means I wouldn't be tempted to buy some
2014-08-03 19:33:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-08-03 19:33:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much
2014-08-03 19:34:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I miss you
2014-08-03 19:37:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Less than 8 days my love 
2014-08-03 19:38:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-08-03 19:40:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Watching the last episode of GoT. So much nudity!
2014-08-03 19:40:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh yeah? A lot of sex or nudity for some other reason?
2014-08-03 19:41:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]People bathing right now
2014-08-03 19:41:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But sex might be coming upppp
2014-08-03 19:41:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-08-03 19:41:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-08-03 19:42:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]False alarm
2014-08-03 19:42:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This dude doesn't have a penis though sooo I could've guessed that
2014-08-03 19:43:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You need to catch up!
2014-08-03 19:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe I'll watch some tonight
2014-08-03 19:43:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a dude doesn't have a penis?
2014-08-03 19:50:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Many dudes don't actually
2014-08-03 19:50:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you talking about the eunuchs?
2014-08-03 19:50:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they just don't have balls right?
2014-08-03 19:51:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ironically they just had a discussion about that.
2014-08-03 19:52:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're unsure if both the "pillar and the stone" are still there lol
2014-08-03 19:52:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha nice
2014-08-03 19:53:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess Chinese eunuchs had their penis removed too
2014-08-03 19:53:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man, that would suck
2014-08-03 19:55:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I wouldn't be able to fully commiserate
2014-08-03 19:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's kinda interesting how humanity discovered that removing balls would have that effect
2014-08-03 19:57:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's sort of logical
2014-08-03 19:57:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]girls don't have balls
2014-08-03 19:57:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we want to make this dude more girly
2014-08-03 19:57:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let's chop his balls off
2014-08-03 19:57:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I wonder like how surprised the first people to do it were
2014-08-03 19:57:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like wow, this guy doesn't have a sex drive any more
2014-08-03 19:58:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and looks kinda feminine
2014-08-03 19:59:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like sexual dimorphic organs have long been iconocized for their role in sexuality/power
2014-08-03 19:59:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right, but it's one thing to be iconized and another thing to realize it would have a biological effect I guess
2014-08-03 19:59:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I suppose they might've figured it out by doing it to animals
2014-08-03 20:00:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's probably what happened I guess
2014-08-03 20:00:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now that I think about it
2014-08-03 20:00:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bet they cut them off as punishment and found out pretty soon after
2014-08-03 20:01:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if you did it to an adult male
2014-08-03 20:01:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you wouldn't see the effeminate effects
2014-08-03 20:01:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he'd just lose his sex drive
2014-08-03 20:01:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you might see some effects
2014-08-03 20:01:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not like when you cut them off before puberty
2014-08-03 20:02:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I guess they knew about it before the days of castrati
2014-08-03 20:03:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, apparently the earliest recorded eunuch is 21st century B.C.
2014-08-03 20:03:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so basically all of recorded human history
2014-08-03 20:03:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]humans are effed up, man
2014-08-03 20:04:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]messing with people's genitals and shit
2014-08-03 20:06:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's funny how cutting off genitals carries more weight than other, functionally important organs
2014-08-03 20:07:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-08-03 20:08:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you had the option of losing your penis or your right arm, what would you choose?
2014-08-03 20:08:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, I see. Right arm.
2014-08-03 20:09:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess that is pretty interesting.
2014-08-03 20:09:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I guess my arm doesn't really affect my personality.
2014-08-03 20:09:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I don't know if I'd say my right arm is more functionally important than my penis.
2014-08-03 20:10:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right leg, then?
2014-08-03 20:10:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-08-03 20:11:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd give my right leg before my right arm
2014-08-03 20:11:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd give both legs before a single arm
2014-08-03 20:11:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I guess
2014-08-03 20:11:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so if you're clitoris was removed now.
2014-08-03 20:11:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would you still be able to orgasm?
2014-08-03 20:12:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your*
2014-08-03 20:12:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well according to recent research, the clitoris is larger than just that little nub
2014-08-03 20:13:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But probably not
2014-08-03 20:13:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know much about the symptoms of female castration
2014-08-03 20:14:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh it makes me uncomfortable to think about
2014-08-03 20:15:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, female castration might be even more fucked up
2014-08-03 20:15:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the motivations are clearly more fucked up
2014-08-03 20:16:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh I'd argue the motivations are fucked up in both cases, but one is much more misogynistic 
2014-08-03 20:17:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah... I guess the fact that female castration is seen as like purifying or whatever
2014-08-03 20:17:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like it's not a punishment
2014-08-03 20:17:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is kind of messed up to me
2014-08-03 20:18:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess it filled a societal role for dudes too
2014-08-03 20:18:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it wasn't universally applied either
2014-08-03 20:22:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, castrating a little boy against his will so he can be a good singer is messed up 
2014-08-03 20:23:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ah i see the universally applied comment. Yeah, categorical castration of all women in a religion is pretty fucked 
2014-08-03 20:24:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]has misogyny been so prevalent in society because men are stronger than women?
2014-08-03 20:24:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you know anything about why it is so frequent?
2014-08-03 20:26:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-08-03 20:26:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that stuff is probably difficult to really pindown
2014-08-03 20:32:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]many primate societies are male dominated
2014-08-03 20:32:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess because theyre bigger/stronger
2014-08-03 20:33:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our social structures are probably related still in a lot of ways
2014-08-03 20:34:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, well I guess gender roles sort of seem like a natural development to me from early humans
2014-08-03 20:35:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm not sure where you necessarily draw the line between gender roles and misogyny in human society
2014-08-03 20:36:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]female castration obviously falls into the misogynist category
2014-08-03 20:40:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That, my dear, is s tricky line haha
2014-08-03 20:40:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One that maybe we dont need to talk about so soon after the Lego debacle
2014-08-03 20:40:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha good call
2014-08-03 20:41:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm also still a little distracted by GoT
2014-08-03 20:41:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no worries    😃 
2014-08-03 20:46:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:*
2014-08-03 21:06:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got kicked out of the BBQ place :/
2014-08-03 21:10:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aww I just saw your FB comment
2014-08-03 21:10:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're too sweet
2014-08-03 21:15:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why'd they kick you out?
2014-08-03 21:20:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause they were filling up I guess 
2014-08-03 21:20:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]$20 for only 1.5 episodes of GoT
2014-08-03 21:20:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bullshit
2014-08-03 21:21:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man.
2014-08-03 21:21:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I bet Denny's wouldn't have kicked you out.
2014-08-03 21:21:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't I know it
2014-08-03 21:21:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it wouldn't have looked as cool on Swarm
2014-08-03 21:21:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-08-03 21:30:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't remember which episode of GoT I'm on and the episode descriptions are complete gibberish
2014-08-03 21:34:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Define gibberish 
2014-08-03 21:34:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a bunch of names
2014-08-03 21:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I figured it out from the previews, though
2014-08-03 21:34:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]episode 4
2014-08-03 21:34:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]season 2
2014-08-03 21:34:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should start learning the names of the characters lol
2014-08-03 21:34:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no comment on my haircut and penis?!
2014-08-03 21:34:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I sent a pic comment 
2014-08-03 21:35:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, I haven't received it.
2014-08-03 21:35:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh it didn't sent
2014-08-03 21:35:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It looks good!
2014-08-03 21:35:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They both do ;)
2014-08-03 21:36:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]neck definitely needs trimmed up
2014-08-03 21:36:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can do dat for ya
2014-08-03 21:40:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what are you doing now?
2014-08-03 21:41:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude's got the hots for the battlefield nurse
2014-08-03 21:42:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sitting in a McDonalds parking lot trying to poach their wifi
2014-08-03 21:42:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not going well
2014-08-03 21:43:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha damn
2014-08-03 21:43:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Might just have to go inside
2014-08-03 21:43:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'm sure if you just get a drink or something they won't care
2014-08-03 21:44:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking there shoud be some kind of Wi-Fi room
2014-08-03 21:44:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Starbucks
2014-08-03 21:44:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-08-03 21:44:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's what it essentially is
2014-08-03 21:44:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But the nearest one is weirdly far away

2014-08-03 22:48:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok, let's see what I can remember
2014-08-03 22:48:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]reading over the last few episodes recaps

2014-08-03 22:53:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mother of Dragons
2014-08-03 22:55:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Joffrey's a little sociopath
2014-08-03 22:55:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I know what's going on, though
2014-08-03 22:55:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd happily rewatch some episodes with you too
2014-08-03 22:56:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like when we're together?
2014-08-03 22:57:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure
2014-08-03 22:58:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you obvs don't have to wait for me
2014-08-03 22:58:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Darling, my phone is about to die and I don't want to sit here with my car on any more
2014-08-03 22:58:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So goodnight

2014-08-04 08:08:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Andrew sent me an email over the weekend saying saying I could work remote and part-time.
2014-08-04 12:03:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What!?!!
2014-08-04 12:03:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you ask about that specifically?
2014-08-04 12:10:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did not. So that's pretty cool!
2014-08-04 12:10:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]$$$
2014-08-04 12:11:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-08-04 12:11:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You might have a busier/more fulfilling year than you thought
2014-08-04 12:12:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, it's looking that way.
2014-08-04 12:13:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pretty awesome I get to work remote.
2014-08-04 12:15:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe they'll fly you in for business meetings!
2014-08-04 12:16:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha maybe. That'd be pretty cool.
2014-08-04 12:16:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How are you doing today,
2014-08-04 12:16:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-08-04 12:18:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did not find my oyster stick
2014-08-04 12:18:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Stick(a)
2014-08-04 12:18:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*sticks
2014-08-04 12:19:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:/
2014-08-04 12:19:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I went to a park and showered without paying the day pass few
2014-08-04 12:19:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*fee
2014-08-04 12:20:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And didn't get caught, so that's cool
2014-08-04 12:20:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#rebel
2014-08-04 12:20:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]#overit
2014-08-04 12:20:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-08-04 12:21:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What would you say your weekly shower average has been?
2014-08-04 12:21:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least 3
2014-08-04 12:21:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There were showers at most campsites
2014-08-04 12:21:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh that's not bad at all.
2014-08-04 12:21:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With hot water even
2014-08-04 12:22:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So like every other day
2014-08-04 12:22:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The longest I've been is 4
2014-08-04 12:22:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that's more what I was expecting.
2014-08-04 12:23:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]4 you definitely feel pretty gross.
2014-08-04 12:25:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth 
2014-08-04 12:27:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found a place in Seattle for tonight! I asked the girl who's dog I gave a ride
2014-08-04 12:28:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet. So are you good now?
2014-08-04 12:31:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Well except for the fact that the larval settlement part of my field season is down the drain
2014-08-04 12:32:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aren't there some other sticks? Or does only having one site not work?
2014-08-04 12:39:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a comparison between North, South, and Hood canal
2014-08-04 12:39:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So yeah missing one defeats the purpose I guess
2014-08-04 12:42:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah, bummer.
2014-08-04 12:43:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm leaving academia, and opening up a coffee shop that's actually conducive to working. Where they don't blast music, bang pots and pans, and giggle loudly
2014-08-04 12:43:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-08-04 14:38:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or institute beautiful outdoor parks with wifi hotspots!
2014-08-04 15:03:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A cougar is going to kill me
2014-08-04 15:04:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Mountain lions, and Olys, and bears, oh my!
2014-08-04 15:04:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I saw your email! Don't die, pls.
2014-08-04 15:05:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should've flown out here....
2014-08-04 15:06:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know. But for real, don't die (for my sake, not yours).
2014-08-04 15:18:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm scared 
2014-08-04 15:20:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure you'll be okay, but I'm sure he said those things on purpose just to make sure you're completely aware of your surroundings.
2014-08-04 15:24:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Should I look for a companion on Craigslist?
2014-08-04 15:25:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha I might be more afraid of the kinds of companions you'd attract.
2014-08-04 15:25:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeahhh
2014-08-04 15:25:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to die for some stupid oysters 
2014-08-04 15:26:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A lady was attacked in September 2013.
2014-08-04 15:27:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Was she alone?
2014-08-04 15:28:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No, her common law husband stabbed it with a spear.
2014-08-04 15:29:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He's the only reason she lived.
2014-08-04 15:29:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck
2014-08-04 15:29:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I should get a spear?
2014-08-04 15:29:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Might not be a bad idea actually.
2014-08-04 15:29:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or a gun.
2014-08-04 15:30:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like the licensing on a gun in Canada for me would equal the cost of flying you out here 
2014-08-04 15:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Get that shit off the books homie
2014-08-04 15:31:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You got the connect, bro?
2014-08-04 15:32:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol. Maybe fro out your hair to make yourself look bigger.
2014-08-04 15:32:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna die
2014-08-04 15:36:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nooo you'll be fine. The bears honestly don't really scare me. But I would read up on cougar safety in the very slim chance you run into one.
2014-08-04 15:38:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There were only three fatal cougar attacks in the 2000s and none of them were on Vancouver Island.
2014-08-04 15:39:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How many were scarred for life or hospitalized?
2014-08-04 15:39:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol I don't have that data.
2014-08-04 16:37:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I lovvveeeee youuuuuuuu
2014-08-04 16:38:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you off of work?

2014-08-04 16:38:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can I call you in a bit?
2014-08-04 16:38:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep

2014-08-04 20:30:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lemme wait until I've showered 
2014-08-04 20:31:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I look like a straight up hobo/mad scientist
2014-08-04 20:31:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not sure love goggles would help
2014-08-04 20:31:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha, but that's half of who I'm in love with
2014-08-04 20:32:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That comment made me tear up
2014-08-04 20:33:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) I love you and you're beautiful.
2014-08-04 21:42:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My host is a geographer for  Expedia.com  and one of his roommates is a Geology major working as a cook at an upscale vegan restaurant
2014-08-04 21:42:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no shit
2014-08-04 21:42:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a geographer huh?
2014-08-04 21:42:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what does he do?
2014-08-04 21:42:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He makes maps 
2014-08-04 21:42:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And does stuff with them
2014-08-04 21:43:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but where are the maps
2014-08-04 21:43:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-08-04 21:44:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he should see if they're looking for a data scientist
2014-08-04 21:44:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah, I'd have to move to Seattle then
2014-08-04 21:45:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He says they have a lot of people work from home 
2014-08-04 21:45:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or a fair amount
2014-08-04 21:46:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're looking for data scientists
2014-08-04 21:46:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]three positions
2014-08-04 21:46:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]all "sr" though
2014-08-04 21:46:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got 3-5 years of data analysis experience at this point in my life, though
2014-08-04 21:46:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just not in an industry sector
2014-08-04 21:47:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think school counts
2014-08-04 21:47:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I published papers
2014-08-04 21:47:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On data science?
2014-08-04 21:47:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-08-04 21:47:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]using data analysis
2014-08-04 21:49:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they do sound like fun jobs
2014-08-04 21:49:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they apparently send people to this knowledge discovery conference every year
2014-08-04 21:50:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my statistics for machine learning professor's post-doc advisor got an award at the conference this year apparently
2014-08-04 22:01:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh shit
2014-08-04 22:01:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]demon killing people
2014-08-04 22:02:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should send me a snap of yo booty
2014-08-04 22:45:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do the awardees at this conference get to dress up? Will I get to wear a pretty dress when you get one some day?
2014-08-04 22:46:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it'd hard to send a booty pic when you're staying on a couch my dear 
2014-08-04 22:46:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]boooo
2014-08-04 22:46:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-08-04 22:46:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but of course you can wear a dress    😃 
2014-08-04 22:50:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why do you think dresses are more attractive than other clothes to guys?
2014-08-04 22:50:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that good looking jeans are to some ladies?
2014-08-04 22:51:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it has anything to do with the dress as much as shape + skin
2014-08-04 22:52:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You honestly look pretty equally sexy whenever you try
2014-08-04 22:55:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I don't look sexy when I don't try?
2014-08-04 22:55:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!!
2014-08-04 22:55:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Meh, you look OK I guess
2014-08-04 22:56:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Back to my original question though, I think the shape thing is interesting 
2014-08-04 22:56:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like a dress vs shorts/tank top
2014-08-04 22:56:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With the same amount for skin showing
2014-08-04 22:57:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Soo a short dress?
2014-08-04 22:57:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah like a sundress 
2014-08-04 22:57:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think there's a bit of a tease factor in that case.
2014-08-04 22:58:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]At least for me.
2014-08-04 22:58:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I also think the ass shape is better in a dress then like jean shorts.
2014-08-04 22:59:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]than
2014-08-04 22:59:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Huh
2014-08-04 23:00:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe not "better", but you're clearly looking at an ass with a think piece of fabric covering it.
2014-08-04 23:00:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Closer to naked I guess.
2014-08-04 23:00:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*thin
2014-08-04 23:01:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That makes sense
2014-08-04 23:02:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably the best thing about football games in the South outside of the football haha
2014-08-04 23:04:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've mentioned that before
2014-08-04 23:05:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would not have liked the idea of wearing a dress in college to a game
2014-08-04 23:05:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But if I went to one with you now I would ;)
2014-08-04 23:05:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like getting pretty for you
2014-08-04 23:06:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why not? I'm jealous of them, man. It's hot as fuck.
2014-08-04 23:06:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I guess the chafing aspect would improve 
2014-08-04 23:07:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You would've definitely wore a dress if you were at Auburn and in a sorority. I'm pretty sure it's the law.
2014-08-04 23:07:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would definitely have not been in a sorority at Auburn lol
2014-08-04 23:08:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK.
2014-08-04 23:08:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I barely fit in at my one in Miami
2014-08-04 23:12:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You could get a job in Seattle
2014-08-04 23:12:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can pull off another 4 years of long distance 
2014-08-04 23:13:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah?
2014-08-04 23:13:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean if that's what will make you the happiest ;)
2014-08-04 23:43:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You asleep darling?
2014-08-04 23:44:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not yet.
2014-08-04 23:46:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why you stop texting me :/
2014-08-04 23:49:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh I don't know. Seemed like there was a break in the conversation.
2014-08-04 23:51:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss yew though
2014-08-04 23:53:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are you doing?
2014-08-04 23:53:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just chilling on the couch
2014-08-04 23:54:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. What time are you getting up tomorrow?
2014-08-04 23:55:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like 7
2014-08-04 23:55:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to be at the car place early 
2014-08-04 23:55:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ick.

2014-08-04 23:56:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And no fruitless mud wading involved
2014-08-04 23:56:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]True.
2014-08-04 23:57:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What episode are you on now?
2014-08-04 23:58:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was watching episode 5, but I didn't really pay attention. I'll have to watch it again.
2014-08-05 00:01:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna try to fall asleep. Goodnight. I love you.
2014-08-05 00:08:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright. I love you too 
2014-08-05 08:16:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good morning, sunshine. I love you. Just over a week now!

2014-08-05 09:01:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Your booty in my crotch with my arm around you and holding your hand.
2014-08-05 09:03:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes!
2014-08-05 09:03:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And feet tangled up in each other, don't forget that par
2014-08-05 09:03:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*part
2014-08-05 09:04:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) might be my favorite part.
2014-08-05 09:04:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's very you.
2014-08-05 09:06:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's takes two to snuggle
2014-08-05 09:06:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha you're so goofy.
2014-08-05 09:06:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you.
2014-08-05 09:08:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss your laugh
2014-08-05 09:08:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And your smile
2014-08-05 09:09:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww, you're being so sweet this morning. I wanna kiss you all over.
2014-08-05 09:10:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like how you close your eyes and just seem to enjoy me kissing different parts of your.
2014-08-05 09:10:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're hitting the 2 week limit
2014-08-05 09:11:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmmm
2014-08-05 09:11:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah you're right.
2014-08-05 09:11:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think there's a single part of my body I wouldn't smile at if you kissed
2014-08-05 09:13:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) I'm down with testing that out.
2014-08-05 09:13:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Open eyeball 
2014-08-05 09:13:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a no no
2014-08-05 09:15:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha ew
2014-08-05 09:15:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I can't lick your eyeball either I guess?
2014-08-05 09:16:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What if it would really turn me on?
2014-08-05 09:16:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like it was my fetish.
2014-08-05 09:17:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Still probably no
2014-08-05 09:17:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Things touching my eyeball really freak me out
2014-08-05 09:17:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But id let you pay a hooker to lick her eyeball
2014-08-05 09:18:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha how sweet of you.
2014-08-05 09:20:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't want you to miss out
2014-08-05 09:23:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well I don't feel like I'm missing out with you, but I guess you have the hooker option too if you ever want it.
2014-08-05 09:24:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Psh I don't need to pay fool, I just bat my eyes and all the boys wanna lick them
2014-08-05 09:34:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh, what were you typing for so long but didn't send
2014-08-05 09:35:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I just said "I meant in general", but realized that was a dumb thing to say.
2014-08-05 09:44:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm having difficulties getting off of this couch
2014-08-05 09:44:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just want to keep sleepinggg
2014-08-05 09:46:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've had trouble getting up the past couple of days.
2014-08-05 09:46:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There was a stretch there where I was getting up before my alarm and always feeling awake.
2014-08-05 09:49:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want my girlfriend with me dammit!!
2014-08-05 09:50:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't be any fun while you're at work right now
2014-08-05 09:50:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just sitting on your bed, naked and waiting for you
2014-08-05 09:51:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😰
2014-08-05 09:52:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think that one has a cold
2014-08-05 09:53:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, I was trying to convey "hot-and-bothered"
2014-08-05 09:56:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So adorable. I want kissessss
2014-08-05 09:58:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're still batting 1.000 on snaps by the way. You're on a hot streak.
2014-08-05 10:07:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]👹
2014-08-05 10:08:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol WTF
2014-08-05 11:45:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was my "hot streak" face
2014-08-05 11:45:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I accidentally went back to sleep for 2 hours lol
2014-08-05 11:48:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha whoops.
2014-08-05 12:30:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]$30 for the car
2014-08-05 12:30:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not too bad I guess  
2014-08-05 12:30:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not bad at all.
2014-08-05 12:31:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I fell for the trendy wifi spot again
2014-08-05 12:31:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]$6 Irish coffee and $6 breakfast
2014-08-05 12:32:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha not too bad I guess. Definitely adds up, though.
2014-08-05 12:58:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well it sounds like you can be my sugar daddy this year ;)
2014-08-05 13:00:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No one in Canada answers their fucking phones 
2014-08-05 13:01:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘
2014-08-05 13:09:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm now debating kayaking to one of the sites
2014-08-05 13:09:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thoughts?
2014-08-05 13:11:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How far will you be kayaking?
2014-08-05 13:11:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Will you have to transport the kayak?
2014-08-05 13:12:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not too far
2014-08-05 13:12:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There is a kayak launch point I can access by car a couple miles away from the oysters 
2014-08-05 13:14:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like it would work.
2014-08-05 15:00:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's work going for you today?
2014-08-05 15:03:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not bad. I have been kind of popular. I helped Andrew with some R code, some random dude introduced himself to me because of the stuff I've been doing, and the guy who organized my meeting said people are excited about my stuff.
2014-08-05 15:03:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're so pretty!
2014-08-05 15:03:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's my man :)
2014-08-05 15:03:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And thank you
2014-08-05 15:04:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just hanging out in the park?
2014-08-05 15:04:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, they haven't called me back about the car
2014-08-05 15:04:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I don't really have anything else to do sooo why not 
2014-08-05 15:05:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word. You looked relaxed :)
2014-08-05 15:06:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made a concrete-ish plan for Canada (no kayaking), I'll be in Seattle by the 9th, so definitely back in LA in time for dinner with your parents
2014-08-05 15:06:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So nothing left to stress about!
2014-08-05 15:07:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good :)

2014-08-05 15:11:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think they're quite chill enough here for me to take my shorts off though
2014-08-05 15:11:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With lacy thong bottoms
2014-08-05 15:11:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're killing me!
2014-08-05 15:12:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't worry, I'm saving some sexy underwear for when you pick me up
2014-08-05 15:13:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or just go commando 
2014-08-05 15:13:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D

2014-08-05 15:22:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just thinking that!
2014-08-05 15:23:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In slightly different words, but with marrying and loving and one day involved
2014-08-05 15:23:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘😘😘😘😍😍😍😘😘

2014-08-05 15:30:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love it about you
2014-08-05 18:30:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this triplet talk all sounds like gibberish
2014-08-05 18:31:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-08-05 18:31:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]music theory
2014-08-05 18:31:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get what a triplet is
2014-08-05 18:31:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the way they were describing it was confusing I thought
2014-08-05 18:37:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really understand how to interpret meter either
2014-08-05 18:37:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just know how they sound.
2014-08-05 19:35:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Call meee
2014-08-05 20:35:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's going on?
2014-08-05 20:37:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It won't let me call you
2014-08-05 20:41:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't see you or hear you, in case you didn't know.
2014-08-05 20:43:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I gotta poop anyway
2014-08-05 20:45:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol call me after 
2014-08-05 20:45:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-08-06 00:08:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Made it, and they have wifi!
2014-08-06 00:08:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're probably asleep now
2014-08-06 01:36:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Staying with this couple makes me think it would be tricky for us to have to host a stranger for the night- we wouldn't be able to have sex!
2014-08-06 07:13:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You think that'd stop us?
2014-08-06 10:25:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks!
2014-08-06 10:26:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And no, it probably wouldn't stop us lol
2014-08-06 10:28:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I'd be less likely if it was a family member or something.
2014-08-06 10:28:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]wish I could video you at work
2014-08-06 10:28:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Even then, I'd probably just take you out back ;)
2014-08-06 10:28:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah me too.
2014-08-06 10:41:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]this place has the WORST free wifi ever
2014-08-06 10:41:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ughhhh
2014-08-06 10:42:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nooo
2014-08-06 10:42:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]are we going to have a backyard in our future apt too?
2014-08-06 10:42:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm liking the sound of this place more and more lol
2014-08-06 10:43:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I was more using it as a metaphor, but I'd be down if we could find one (I'm guessing we won't)
2014-08-06 10:43:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]wait it's working!
2014-08-06 10:44:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]a little balcony
2014-08-06 10:44:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]totally more private haha
2014-08-06 10:45:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd do ya on a balcony.
2014-08-06 10:45:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd definitely enjoy that
2014-08-06 10:46:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha ya?
2014-08-06 10:49:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]at this point, I'd probably enjoy sex with you on a hard concrete surface
2014-08-06 10:55:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-08-06 11:02:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This one intern is the ultimate ass kisser.
2014-08-06 11:16:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got up and moved to starbucks
2014-08-06 11:25:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a conflicting country code!
2014-08-06 11:25:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how do I change the country code on my computer?
2014-08-06 11:30:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I fixed it
2014-08-06 11:36:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]talk to meeee
2014-08-06 11:44:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😢 
2014-08-06 11:57:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sorry. I'm at the intern Lunch 'N' Learn with the CEO. Probably a bad idea to be texting!
2014-08-06 11:58:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha ok understandable 
2014-08-06 11:59:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have fun 
2014-08-06 11:59:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!
2014-08-06 12:01:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm out now, though. Did I miss you? :((((
2014-08-06 12:09:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. I love you.
2014-08-06 13:25:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found where they sell maps!
2014-08-06 13:28:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Of course. Good ol' Maps & Flags!
2014-08-06 14:12:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On the ferry, and it has free wifi!
2014-08-06 14:13:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Gangster
2014-08-06 14:14:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just spent way too long trying to get this stupid fucking R plot to do what I want.
2014-08-06 14:19:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since when do you say gangster? Haha
2014-08-06 14:20:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm sorry, fucking with R plots is probably one of my least favorite activities ever
2014-08-06 14:20:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I probably used it when I was 13.
2014-08-06 14:22:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How's Canada?
2014-08-06 14:29:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's very pretty and people actually speak French 
2014-08-06 14:30:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Desperately looking outside trying to see a whale
2014-08-06 14:47:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice.
2014-08-06 14:49:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you!
2014-08-06 14:51:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The CEO spoke about work/family balance and also have an honest answer I thought.
2014-08-06 15:06:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I'm not getting hangout notifications
2014-08-06 15:06:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What was their answer?
2014-08-06 15:06:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't get a notification from you either before.
2014-08-06 15:07:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That it ain't easy. You have to work hard at it and that you'll have to make sacrifices.
2014-08-06 15:07:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Honestly, all these people with too much, in my opinion.
2014-08-06 15:07:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*work.
2014-08-06 15:07:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well they make a lot of money I guess
2014-08-06 15:08:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The only way I could ever see myself working that much is if I started the company myself.
2014-08-06 15:08:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]was this another female?
2014-08-06 15:08:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And even then, it'd only be for a few years.
2014-08-06 15:08:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah, a dude.
2014-08-06 15:09:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]would you start a company yourself?
2014-08-06 15:09:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess that's a little too hypothetical 
2014-08-06 15:09:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have this idea for a music education site that I think would be cool
2014-08-06 15:10:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure how it would make money, though.
2014-08-06 15:11:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's why you get a business partner that does know how to make money
2014-08-06 15:11:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so you're still struggling a little with meter?
2014-08-06 15:12:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't understand how to interpret the numbers really.
2014-08-06 15:12:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's basically just memorizing what they sound like.
2014-08-06 15:13:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the numbers?
2014-08-06 15:13:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like I know 3:4 is a waltz, but I couldn't get there just looking at the numbers.
2014-08-06 15:13:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Time signature?
2014-08-06 15:15:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh
2014-08-06 15:15:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hmmmm
2014-08-06 15:16:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that might be trickier to just learn in a week. Like might require old school clapping exercises to internalize different meters
2014-08-06 15:17:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I do have them internalized. I'm saying I don't understand how the numbers get translate to the rhythm or whatever the word is.
2014-08-06 15:17:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the numbers are the number of quater notes in a measure
2014-08-06 15:17:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]4 = quater note
2014-08-06 15:18:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so 6/8 is 6 eighth notes in a measure
2014-08-06 15:19:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What is 4/2 then?
2014-08-06 15:19:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It doesn't make sense to me. You can explain it in person.
2014-08-06 15:19:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha ok
2014-08-06 15:20:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]4/2 is 4 half notes in a measure
2014-08-06 15:20:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or cut time
2014-08-06 15:20:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah, we can have a little music lesson and you can teach me some guitar chords
2014-08-06 15:21:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK.
2014-08-06 15:27:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just saw a pod of killer whales!
2014-08-06 15:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Holy cow! I'm so jealous. You should tell my mom haha.
2014-08-06 15:29:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I will!
2014-08-06 15:30:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]About to arrive in port though so I'm going offline for a bit
2014-08-06 15:30:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-08-06 16:57:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just saw the tips of their dorsal fins, I didn't see any faces :/
2014-08-06 16:58:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it gives me hope I'll see more!
2014-08-06 16:58:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still pretty cool
2014-08-06 16:58:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There were a ton of whale watching boats around them 
2014-08-06 17:01:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I were a whale I don't think I'd dig it
2014-08-06 17:01:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess noise pollution is actually a pretty big bummer for whales too    😞 
2014-08-06 17:02:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you get your r code to work?
2014-08-06 17:03:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I had it working when I messaged you before.
2014-08-06 17:03:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just couldn't use the package I wanted to use
2014-08-06 17:03:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ggplot2
2014-08-06 17:05:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they took some sort of philosophical stance
2014-08-06 17:05:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where they don't like having two y axes on the same plot
2014-08-06 17:05:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the only way to do it is super hackish
2014-08-06 17:05:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I ended up just using plot() and not using ggplot2
2014-08-06 17:05:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]kinda obnoxious, though
2014-08-06 17:08:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha a philosophical stance?
2014-08-06 17:08:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, like they think it is bad
2014-08-06 17:08:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so they won't implement it
2014-08-06 17:08:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like it's a poor way to represent data
2014-08-06 17:09:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's sassy
2014-08-06 17:09:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha no doubt
2014-08-06 17:09:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I know anyone that says "sassy" besides you
2014-08-06 17:10:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how you gonna hate on me for not calling you?!
2014-08-06 17:10:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I talk to you so much!
2014-08-06 17:11:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gotta call sassy shit when you see it
2014-08-06 17:11:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I knowww, I just wanted to get this response from you
2014-08-06 17:11:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And explain why you aren't on my top 3 list
2014-08-06 17:12:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you obviously should be
2014-08-06 17:12:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I thought it was funny.
2014-08-06 17:13:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm going to expand my RAM and get an SSD
2014-08-06 17:15:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pop
2014-08-06 17:15:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*ooo
2014-08-06 17:34:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Going to the British museum fo free right now!
2014-08-06 17:34:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But will leave to shelter of free wifi
2014-08-06 17:35:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-08-06 21:45:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey
2014-08-06 21:45:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey
2014-08-06 21:45:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wanna chat a bit
2014-08-06 21:46:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or are you going to bed soon?
2014-08-06 21:46:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah it's a little before 11 here
2014-08-06 21:46:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]of course I wanna chat

2014-08-06 23:01:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you
2014-08-06 23:01:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's just been this constant ache today
2014-08-06 23:02:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw :( that's so sad and sweet at the same time
2014-08-06 23:03:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure the next few days will go by quick.
2014-08-06 23:03:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah I know
2014-08-06 23:04:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And then everything will be right in the world :)
2014-08-06 23:04:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sooo much will be right
2014-08-06 23:05:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You really make me happy on so many levels. It's great.
2014-08-06 23:05:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it really makes being apart from you a drag.
2014-08-06 23:05:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so I should be less awesome?
2014-08-06 23:06:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That being said, you make it as good as it could possibly be when we're apart.
2014-08-06 23:06:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that'd be one solution I suppose.
2014-08-06 23:07:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're just so much more than a girlfriend to me already.
2014-08-06 23:07:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It hasn't even been 5 months yet!
2014-08-06 23:08:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)))))
2014-08-06 23:08:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's hard to imagine that one day we won't say "I love you" 30 times a day to each other
2014-08-06 23:08:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]only 20
2014-08-06 23:09:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I'm always gonna tell you a lot.
2014-08-06 23:09:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna keep you to that
2014-08-06 23:10:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]As long as you like hearing it, I'll keep saying it.
2014-08-06 23:11:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe one day I'll stop feeling the need to make stupid sassy comments every once in a while to "balance out the sweetness"
2014-08-06 23:12:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just going back to what I was saying, though... I really can't overstate how much even your friendship and support mean to me
2014-08-06 23:12:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha that'll be the day!
2014-08-06 23:13:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, I was thinking about how this trip would've been without you to talk to
2014-08-06 23:13:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't have made it
2014-08-06 23:14:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure you would've, but I'm glad I could help you manage
2014-08-06 23:15:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've been so patient with me sometimes whining and talking about trip details that are totally boring. And making me feel a little less alone (even when I don't have wifi and just imagine you being next to me)
2014-08-06 23:15:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww
2014-08-06 23:17:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Our interactions are really fulfilling for me.
2014-08-06 23:17:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I agree
2014-08-06 23:18:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just can't wait to see you. I'm so lucky.
2014-08-06 23:18:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're so lucky
2014-08-06 23:19:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you especially are lucky    😃 
2014-08-06 23:19:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] 😉 
2014-08-06 23:20:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]send me a snap before I go!
2014-08-06 23:23:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I couldn't hear it!
2014-08-06 23:23:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww man.
2014-08-06 23:23:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But luckily I know you're lips well enough I knew what you were saying
2014-08-06 23:24:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmmm those lips
2014-08-06 23:24:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-08-06 23:24:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you so much
2014-08-06 23:25:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good night darling 
2014-08-06 23:25:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My sun and stars :)
2014-08-06 23:25:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know that reference!
2014-08-06 23:26:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much. Thanks for being you.
2014-08-06 23:26:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have fun.
2014-08-07 00:55:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ended up paying $30 for a hostel that has free wifi and comfy chairs. If I had just done that in the 1st place I wouldn't have had to go to Denny's -_-
2014-08-07 00:55:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks for turning on your comp and calling me back
2014-08-07 20:55:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This popped up on reddit

2014-08-08 19:51:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Theon's transition seems too sudden and out of character in the series, is it different in the books?

2014-08-10 08:59:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Until I get to chicago 
2014-08-10 09:19:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK. I guess we'll be au naturel then :)

2014-08-10 09:39:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](a guess)

2014-08-10 12:05:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You were a chunky baby!
2014-08-10 12:05:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But so adorable
2014-08-10 12:06:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm noticing a lack of adorableness regarding 14-year-old me    😉 
2014-08-10 12:09:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bet you were a lady killa
2014-08-10 12:09:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For the other 14 year olds haha
2014-08-10 12:09:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha something like that
2014-08-10 12:09:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my grandparents have been keeping a bunch of my family's stuff
2014-08-10 12:09:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was going through some of my old things
2014-08-10 12:10:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]most of it's junk
2014-08-10 12:12:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want more pics of younger michael  
2014-08-10 12:13:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, maybe I'll tell my mom to bring a few
2014-08-10 12:16:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yessss
2014-08-10 12:17:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess we're going to Downtown Disney tm  
2014-08-10 12:23:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Whaaat I'm jealous.
2014-08-10 12:38:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you been?
2014-08-10 12:42:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. It's pretty cool. I wish I was going with you.
2014-08-10 12:45:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Daniel is kinda getting cold feet lol
2014-08-10 12:48:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah? I can imagine eating with his sister's boyfriend's parents doesn't sound all that appealing. My parents are reasonably fun, though.
2014-08-10 12:49:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or at least not awkward.
2014-08-10 12:53:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I told him that. And that they may be his sisters parents in law so he's gonna have to meet them eventually :)
2014-08-10 12:53:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awwww
2014-08-10 12:55:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think he's more worried about being awkward himself 
2014-08-10 12:55:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my little brother can be pretty awkward
2014-08-10 12:55:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe they can bond over their awkward artsiness
2014-08-10 12:56:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or maybe it'll result in the most awkward situation known to man
2014-08-10 12:56:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]actually, my little bro seems to be a lot better on that front now
2014-08-10 12:56:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think college is doing a lot of good for him
2014-08-10 13:02:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's he going to school for again?
2014-08-10 13:03:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Theater
2014-08-10 13:18:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My grandpa has this picture of his mom when she was a baby and it's four generations on the maternal line. Super cool.
2014-08-10 13:18:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Taken in 1909.
2014-08-10 13:57:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Was it on metal?
2014-08-10 14:02:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was on his computer, but I'm guessing it was film.
2014-08-10 14:02:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty neat
2014-08-10 14:03:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are there any fragrances  you don't particularly like?
2014-08-10 14:07:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that's an interesting question. Not that I know of. Why?
2014-08-10 14:07:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm buying candles
2014-08-10 14:08:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are there any you particularly like?
2014-08-10 14:09:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so. I'm sure anything you pick I'd be okay with.
2014-08-10 14:09:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're not at the Taste of Oregon thing are you?
2014-08-10 14:09:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I'm still driving but in terrrrrible traffic
2014-08-10 14:10:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh so you're buying them on your phone?
2014-08-10 14:10:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-08-10 14:10:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're so considerate :)
2014-08-10 14:13:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe sandalwood tickles your nose. I don't want you sneezing snot all over my pussy
2014-08-10 14:13:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ew
2014-08-10 14:14:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-08-10 14:16:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You expecting some pussy eating or something? ;)
2014-08-10 14:20:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm demanding it
2014-08-10 14:37:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oooh, I like that
2014-08-10 16:19:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just got a little trampoline action in.
2014-08-10 16:27:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Trampolines terrify me
2014-08-10 16:27:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol they're pretty fucking dangerous.
2014-08-10 16:39:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My little step-cousin asked me if I knew Linkin Park and Papa Roach haha.
2014-08-10 16:39:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He's like 7.
2014-08-10 16:59:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-08-10 16:59:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do they even make new music anymore?
2014-08-10 17:01:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Linkin Park released an album this summer and the boy showed me a video for a song I've never heard before so I guess?
2014-08-10 17:03:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So angry
2014-08-10 17:03:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're listening to This American Life 
2014-08-10 17:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I know. We watched the "One Step Closer" video and it was so clearly late 90s early 2000s
2014-08-10 17:04:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How is it?
2014-08-10 17:05:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So good. I love Ira Glass
2014-08-10 17:07:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, it's a pretty great program.
2014-08-10 17:07:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How much more time do you have in the car?
2014-08-10 17:08:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess 12 hours
2014-08-10 17:08:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We might drive straight there
2014-08-10 17:09:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No shit.
2014-08-10 17:11:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm not sure what to say to your mom about dinner: 
2014-08-10 17:14:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well what do you want to do?
2014-08-10 17:17:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meeting at 4p would kind of suck, not gonna lie. But I don't want them to just hang around downtown Disney waiting for me
2014-08-10 17:18:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. Do you want me to say something to her?
2014-08-10 17:19:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No! 
2014-08-10 17:19:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha that seems cowardly
2014-08-10 17:20:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well she's being kinda pushy.
2014-08-10 17:20:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just say that's too early. She won't be offended.
2014-08-10 17:24:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh. I was called "baby" by the McDonald's cashier.
2014-08-10 17:24:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, and if we ate at that time Daniel and I would still catch traffic coming back north. I'll tell her we'll leave at 4p and get there before 4:45p
2014-08-10 17:25:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure that would work.
2014-08-10 20:24:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah 
2014-08-10 22:43:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey, sugar.

2014-08-10 23:54:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That hike sounds amazing! It would definitely be a bit strenuous for both of us I'd think with the lack of really prolonged physical exercise in our life lol
2014-08-11 00:00:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. That's a lot to do in a day.
2014-08-11 00:02:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate whomping out though
2014-08-11 00:02:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*whimping

2014-08-11 10:52:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really would love some juice 
2014-08-11 10:53:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too much Mountain Dew got me dehydrated  
2014-08-11 10:54:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I know you're not joking. Only makes it goofier.
2014-08-11 10:59:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only one more nighttttt

2014-08-12 13:52:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's the drive?
2014-08-12 14:14:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why'd you hang up?
2014-08-12 14:36:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you ask your dad to delay my flight a couple of hours?
2014-08-12 14:36:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😖😖😖

2014-08-12 17:36:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Spoke too soon, this flight is delayed at gate so looks like I won't get in to Chicago until 11:25
2014-08-12 19:23:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. I guess give me a call when you get to Denver.

2014-08-25 17:34:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have zero filter game, and a propensity for subscribing to stupid newsletters by accident
2014-08-25 17:41:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol you're a nut.
2014-08-25 17:47:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's the drive?
2014-08-25 17:50:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Super smooth of course. Since I'm going somewhere I don't want to be.
2014-08-25 17:50:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Been listening to some football podcasts.
2014-08-25 17:58:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure you're excited about that
2014-08-25 17:58:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can have football watch parties next year!
2014-08-25 17:59:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It'll just be me and you haha
2014-08-25 17:59:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mo and Hardy like football
2014-08-25 18:00:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mo has watch parties every once on a while 
2014-08-25 18:00:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you'll make work friends? Haha
2014-08-25 18:06:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure if there's all that many football fans in software either! Maybe we'll find some Tigers and Canes at their bars.
2014-08-25 18:07:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can always invite Cam
2014-08-25 18:07:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lollllll

2014-08-25 19:47:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna binge so much orange is the new black 
2014-08-25 19:48:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The only bright side of not being by your side right now 
2014-08-25 19:54:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw. We have to figure out what we're gonna do about Masters of Sex.
2014-08-25 19:56:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can binge when we see each other if you'd like. 
2014-08-25 19:58:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or watch it together over video :)
2014-08-25 20:01:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Might be better to do it over video so we don't forget things.
2014-08-25 20:02:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Okkkk
2014-08-25 20:03:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you
2014-08-25 20:04:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you too. I got spoiled seeing you every day.
2014-08-25 20:20:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kind of like the idea of when we can just be hanging out in the same apt together, no pressure to "do" anything because we see each other every day
2014-08-25 20:22:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some stability
2014-08-25 20:26:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, me too. Just chilling in the same room as you makes me very content.
2014-08-25 20:26:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My phone kept wanting to correct chilling to cumming haha
2014-08-25 20:33:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your phone knows what's up
2014-08-25 20:38:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]23 days without a Grade A Alcorn orgasm

2014-08-25 22:27:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There's not really much around. Should I eat Waffle House?
2014-08-25 22:27:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only if you're prepared for the WHP
2014-08-25 22:28:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Waffle House Poops

2014-08-25 23:32:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have you heard about this documentary about Roger Ebert?
2014-08-25 23:33:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I saw a blurb about it a while back but haven't seen it
2014-08-25 23:34:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This podcast I was listening to had high praise.
2014-08-25 23:34:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They also really liked Snowpiercer.
2014-08-25 23:35:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It seems like a pretty cool podcast.

2014-08-25 23:38:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What time are you leaving tm?
2014-08-25 23:39:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]8:30 I think.
2014-08-25 23:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There are so many spots to have sex on a queen-sized bed.
2014-08-25 23:40:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How many more than a full?
2014-08-25 23:42:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]30% more
2014-08-25 23:44:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll have queen or King size beds when I visit you :)
2014-08-25 23:50:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you compare surface areas?
2014-08-25 23:51:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-08-25 23:53:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm drifting to sleep 
2014-08-25 23:54:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you, and miss you!
2014-08-25 23:56:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I'm gonna try to fall asleep. I already miss you so much. I loved spending the past two weeks with you.
2014-08-25 23:56:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Goodnight. I love you.
2014-08-25 23:57:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even with the kitty my bed feels way too empty
2014-08-25 23:57:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I regret ever griping about you pushing me out of it
2014-08-26 12:24:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're so sweet :)
2014-08-26 12:24:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm back on campus.
2014-08-26 12:24:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you shot your brains out yet?
2014-08-26 12:26:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's hot in Texas.
2014-08-26 12:28:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh, "feels like 99"
2014-08-26 12:28:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't envy you
2014-08-26 12:33:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha not yet... rapidly getting there, though. I've already been reminded that UTD dudes don't flush urinals for some reason.
2014-08-26 12:42:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My phone is having serious issues. The processor just struggles with the simplest tasks. I don't know WTF is going on.
2014-08-26 12:43:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] It's time for a new phone!
2014-08-26 14:10:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where would you go for lunch in the summer when hutch closed?
2014-08-26 14:20:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Don't even know! I worked at the Field Museum and from home a lot my one summer as a student.
2014-08-26 14:49:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Makes sense 
2014-08-26 14:49:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Time to pay my effing ticket

2014-08-26 14:59:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe
2014-08-26 15:00:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If my reimbursements don't get here before rent is due, then probably
2014-08-26 15:00:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK, 1,000,000% interest
2014-08-26 15:01:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can that be paid in sexual favors?
2014-08-26 15:02:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]absolutely
2014-08-26 15:02:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My favorite currency.
2014-08-26 15:03:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should've sucked it up and turned in the receipts before we went to Montana 
2014-08-26 15:04:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can spot you if it gets desperate.
2014-08-26 15:04:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks honey

2014-08-26 15:11:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wanna video a little tonight and figure out hotel rooms?
2014-08-26 15:11:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yep!
2014-08-26 15:11:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was your class?
2014-08-26 15:11:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]vaguely interesting, but I know better.
2014-08-26 15:13:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As in that it will get boring soon?
2014-08-26 15:13:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well, she already said attendance is mandatory, which is so utterly bull shit for a graduate class.
2014-08-26 15:14:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Let me look up how many students are in this class.
2014-08-26 15:14:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There are 55 students enrolled.
2014-08-26 15:14:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And she wants people to "participate"
2014-08-26 15:14:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]55 people cannot "participate"
2014-08-26 15:15:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's utterly ridiculous to require attendance to a class that is going to be entirely lecture-based
2014-08-26 15:15:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Totes ridiculous
2014-08-26 15:15:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just post the goddamn lectures online and quit wasting my time
2014-08-26 15:15:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is she young?
2014-08-26 15:15:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]youngish
2014-08-26 15:15:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she taught my Machine Learning course too
2014-08-26 15:15:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the first half at least
2014-08-26 15:16:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she had a baby half way through
2014-08-26 15:16:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she's a really bad lecturer, which makes it worse
2014-08-26 15:16:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]reads off the slides a lot
2014-08-26 15:16:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Chinese with a pretty heavy accent
2014-08-26 15:16:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think there are 3 Americans in the class, lol
2014-08-26 15:16:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]< 10 girls
2014-08-26 15:17:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]0 American girls
2014-08-26 15:17:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]0 non-white/Indian/Chinese
2014-08-26 15:17:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just feel completely isolated
2014-08-26 15:17:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in every single one of my classes
2014-08-26 15:17:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Such an odd experience
2014-08-26 16:13:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you're one of 3 white guys in the class?
2014-08-26 16:13:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I'm sure my conversation skills are lacking today
2014-08-26 16:18:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Been trying to get shit done.

2014-08-26 16:52:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's making me wish I took a philosophy class in college
2014-08-26 16:53:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? Philosophy is kinda rapidly losing value, in my opinion.
2014-08-26 16:54:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This guy is kind of shitting in philosophers
2014-08-26 16:54:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If he delivers what he's called for in the Intro, I think you'd dig this book
2014-08-26 16:55:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You'll have to let me know.
2014-08-26 16:55:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And then summarize it for me so I don't have to read it, haha
2014-08-26 16:56:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should start taking better notes then
2014-08-26 18:20:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did I leave my glove in Chicago?!

2014-08-26 18:40:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you take it to Jimmy's?
2014-08-26 18:41:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Didn't we go straight there after?
2014-08-26 18:47:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dude definitely has a "particular" vibe.
2014-08-26 18:47:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In his mid 40s probably.
2014-08-26 18:47:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In shape.
2014-08-26 18:47:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Short.
2014-08-26 18:47:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Has a recent ex it seems like.
2014-08-26 18:48:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A few Christian things here and there, but not overwhelming.
2014-08-26 18:48:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you could've left it at the field and Brett took it back
2014-08-26 18:48:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I took it off, though.
2014-08-26 18:49:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The last thing I was doing was pitching.
2014-08-26 18:49:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I wouldn't have taken it off.
2014-08-26 18:50:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll look around and call Jimmy's
2014-08-26 18:50:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks, sugar.
2014-08-26 18:50:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not really vital I guess.
2014-08-26 18:50:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've had it since I was a little kid, though.
2014-08-26 18:54:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty vital.
2014-08-26 18:55:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jimmy's said no
2014-08-26 18:55:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm, well hopefully you'll stumble upon it, but don't expend any extra energy trying to find it.
2014-08-26 18:56:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think you and this dude will get along?
2014-08-26 18:57:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well enough.
2014-08-26 18:57:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll probably just keep to myself, which I think is just fine with him.
2014-08-26 18:57:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What happened to the previous tenant of your room?
2014-08-26 18:57:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They were summer interns.
2014-08-26 18:58:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He said he would give contact info of past tenants in the post, though.
2014-08-26 18:58:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So he seems to be fairly confident in his ability to house people.
2014-08-26 18:58:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just wish I was living with you already.
2014-08-26 18:59:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could be setting up our entertainment system right now.
2014-08-26 18:59:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Instead, I'm not even going to get to use my sound system.
2014-08-26 18:59:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You have a sound system?
2014-08-26 18:59:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm turned on
2014-08-26 18:59:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You didn't notice it?
2014-08-26 19:00:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah now that I think about it I did
2014-08-26 19:00:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, man. I got that 5.1 game.
2014-08-26 19:01:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol
2014-08-26 19:01:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd be unpacking the kitchen stuff
2014-08-26 19:01:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Putting everything where I like it
2014-08-26 19:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aww, we'd be so adorable
2014-08-26 19:02:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh! This dude has a pool, but said I would have to pay for part of the chemicals and help maintain it if I wanted to use it.
2014-08-26 19:02:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What a grinch 
2014-08-26 19:02:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I declined.
2014-08-26 19:03:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least one of out hotels should have an outdoor pool
2014-08-26 19:03:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I'm guessing they all will.
2014-08-26 19:03:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How much did he want you to pay
2014-08-26 19:03:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What days are you visiting again?
2014-08-26 19:04:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]17-21
2014-08-26 19:04:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna shower cause I just ran, then wanna get on video?
2014-08-26 19:04:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yep.
2014-08-26 19:18:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where are youuuu
2014-08-26 20:05:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I should really talk about that stuff out loud.
2014-08-26 20:05:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He just said split it, though.
2014-08-26 20:05:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which is more than I'm willing to spend.
2014-08-26 20:05:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You think hes listening in?
2014-08-26 20:05:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He's not here, but I don't know if the roommate is and I don't really want to risk anything.
2014-08-26 20:06:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still have bad vibes
2014-08-26 20:06:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lock your door at night
2014-08-26 20:06:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You can talk, haha
2014-08-26 20:06:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got my headphones on!
2014-08-26 20:20:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm grateful for the nipple shots.
2014-08-26 20:20:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My room is also right next to his bedrooml
2014-08-26 20:25:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100405075123071&set=t.7031174&type=3&theater
2014-08-26 20:46:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why aren't you sneering 
2014-08-26 20:46:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*answering
2014-08-26 20:46:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My internet is clearly having issues.
2014-08-26 20:47:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My messages aren't sending from my computer.
2014-08-26 20:48:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Boo
2014-08-26 20:49:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe someone else is home
2014-08-26 20:50:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. I'm still receiving messages and I can still look at web pages. Don't know what's up.
2014-08-26 20:52:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did that picture give you a boner?
2014-08-26 20:52:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-08-26 20:53:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No. It was very sexy, though.
2014-08-26 20:53:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😖😖😖
2014-08-26 20:53:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would definitely be rubbing my face all over then if I was there.
2014-08-26 20:54:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We got so spoiled for two straight weeks! This sucks.
2014-08-26 20:54:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm ready to live with you now!
2014-08-26 20:56:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh man you have no idea
2014-08-26 20:57:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's incentive to keep making things work though
2014-08-26 20:59:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For sure. I feel really good about everything.
2014-08-26 21:00:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah 
2014-08-26 21:03:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No glove :/
2014-08-26 21:04:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How weird 
2014-08-26 21:05:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll check with Brett too
2014-08-26 21:05:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry
2014-08-26 21:22:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just made a very strange smoothie to curtail my ice cream craving 
2014-08-26 21:22:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Baileys, milk, chocolate almond milk, vodka, vanilla Greek yogurt, ice
2014-08-26 21:44:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whatcha doing?
2014-08-26 21:55:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just ate with the dude.
2014-08-26 21:55:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was that smoothie?
2014-08-26 21:57:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol G+ auto-backup is gonna get me in trouble one of these days
2014-08-26 21:57:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If my titties get out in the internet....
2014-08-26 21:58:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll only get granny panties and sports bra pics from me for the rest of your life
2014-08-26 21:58:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they'd either result in world peace or all out war
2014-08-26 21:58:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]noooooooo
2014-08-26 21:58:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd still think you're sexy anyway
2014-08-26 21:59:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Smoothie was pretty fuckin awesome
2014-08-26 21:59:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's dinner
2014-08-26 21:59:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aight

2014-08-26 22:01:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yummm
2014-08-26 22:03:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I might need to get a bike.
2014-08-26 22:04:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Tom Thumb is 1.2 miles away and Kroger is 1.6 miles away.
2014-08-26 22:04:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but how will I transport milk?
2014-08-26 22:04:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Def need a bike
2014-08-26 22:04:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just buy half gallons I guess?
2014-08-26 22:05:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's so much cheaper to buy full gallons!
2014-08-26 22:05:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Get a basket
2014-08-26 22:05:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's way more cheaper to not have a car
2014-08-26 22:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]truth
2014-08-26 22:07:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Get a basket for your bike
2014-08-26 22:07:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or a bike with a thing in the back to strap a crate to
2014-08-26 22:07:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-08-26 22:08:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm almost definitely giving you my car for the spring
2014-08-26 22:08:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think?
2014-08-26 22:08:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless it looks like I'll really be at the museum 
2014-08-26 22:09:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But this lab is pretty sweet, and the Kronforst lab has everything else I'd need to make libraries
2014-08-26 22:10:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-08-26 22:10:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that would be pretty awesome
2014-08-26 22:10:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Could you get a parking pass for the spring?
2014-08-26 22:10:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't want you to feel like you'd need to do that for me.
2014-08-26 22:11:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, definitely.
2014-08-26 22:12:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'd get way more happiness and use out of it then me. 
2014-08-26 22:14:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're so sweet.
2014-08-26 22:14:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Let's see how the semester goes and reevaluate.
2014-08-26 22:15:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I have a feeling I'll be happy to borrow it for a semester.
2014-08-26 22:15:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should still buy a bike
2014-08-26 22:16:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can go on bike rides next summer!
2014-08-26 22:16:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'm definitely going to start searching craigslist.
2014-08-26 22:16:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's funny you're all about bike rides
2014-08-26 22:16:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm just not used to it.
2014-08-26 22:16:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hannah couldn't ride a bike well.
2014-08-26 22:16:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]She couldn't ride at all when we started dating.
2014-08-26 22:17:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So going for bike rides wasn't a possibility.
2014-08-26 22:18:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She just never learned how to bike?
2014-08-26 22:18:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-08-26 22:22:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I missss youuu
2014-08-26 22:22:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want cuddles.
2014-08-26 22:24:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes please
2014-08-26 22:28:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm giving Ajay my bed.
2014-08-26 22:28:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-08-26 22:28:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll have furnished half of his apartment at that point.
2014-08-26 22:29:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Youre a good friend
2014-08-26 22:41:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have two classes in a building I haven't been in before this semester.
2014-08-26 22:41:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That sentence is delightfully ambiguous, but it means the same either way
2014-08-26 22:43:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha delightfully?
2014-08-26 22:44:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah! I'm gonna really need to dig for the positives in between seeing you.
2014-08-26 22:46:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like it
2014-08-26 22:47:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You seem to dig the positive when youre with me
2014-08-26 22:47:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel really positive when I'm with you
2014-08-26 22:48:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You are good for me on multiple levels.
2014-08-26 22:49:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you so much
2014-08-26 22:49:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-08-26 22:51:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you could just take the car in Oct
2014-08-26 22:51:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you have time to drive it down
2014-08-26 22:52:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm.
2014-08-26 22:53:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really I should've given it to you for the summer
2014-08-26 22:53:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, well it's too late for that now!
2014-08-26 22:53:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The October thing might work, though.
2014-08-26 22:54:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might not have to miss my class on Monday either.
2014-08-26 22:54:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Depending on how hungover I was on Sunday.
2014-08-26 22:54:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]By the way, if I can be zero hungover because I'm on other drugs I'm okay with that.
2014-08-26 22:55:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very subtle haha
2014-08-26 22:55:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you done drugs at the halloween party?
2014-08-26 22:57:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no, but I definitely would because for everyone there I either (A) don't care what they think or ( B ) know them well enough that it would be funny
2014-08-26 22:58:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some people whom you dont care about may do
2014-08-26 22:58:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cocaine would definitely be a plus at that party though
2014-08-26 22:58:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-08-26 23:00:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would help me from bailing on the party at 3a
2014-08-26 23:00:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I'm too sleepy from too much drinking
2014-08-26 23:01:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word.
2014-08-26 23:01:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I meant to say "some people you don't care about, I do"
2014-08-26 23:01:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I went until like 5 AM at the 2011 party and barely drank
2014-08-26 23:03:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I don't know how I'd feel if Supriya/Laura/Dave knew my boyfriend was on drugs. Unfortunately I think some of them would vuew me negatively for it
2014-08-26 23:03:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, I see
2014-08-26 23:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was gonna say I think I could get away with rolling
2014-08-26 23:04:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I definitely couldn ot
2014-08-26 23:05:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha no I don't think so
2014-08-26 23:05:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not unless you only talked to me and the people who wouldn't care
2014-08-26 23:05:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or waited to peak when everyone was wasted
2014-08-26 23:06:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's not a bad idea
2014-08-26 23:06:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could pull it off i think
2014-08-26 23:06:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've rolled "in secret" a couple of times
2014-08-26 23:06:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-08-26 23:06:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could take MDMA and get away with it
2014-08-26 23:06:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not full on roll
2014-08-26 23:07:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not like what we did together.
2014-08-26 23:07:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No i definitely couldn't do that either
2014-08-26 23:07:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was a pretty solid roll
2014-08-26 23:07:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for sure
2014-08-26 23:07:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the setting was so nice too
2014-08-26 23:08:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it hit me right after giving you that massage
2014-08-26 23:08:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was perfect
2014-08-26 23:08:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Next time we do that, we can plan better for how we want to come up. Maybe not with a disney movie lol
2014-08-26 23:09:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't know
2014-08-26 23:09:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least for me
2014-08-26 23:09:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I didn't really come up while watching
2014-08-26 23:09:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just sitting there
2014-08-26 23:09:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like coming up while massaging you, though
2014-08-26 23:09:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get kinda anxious on the come up
2014-08-26 23:09:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that kept my mind off it
2014-08-26 23:10:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can too, and I guess I was feeling a little anxious before we went in the bedroom
2014-08-26 23:11:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you need to take your's before me next time too ;)
2014-08-26 23:11:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, if we're trying to be on the same schedule
2014-08-26 23:13:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd like to see a show rolling with you too
2014-08-26 23:14:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure if that's my scene
2014-08-26 23:14:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd have fun with just you rolling
2014-08-26 23:15:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't think?
2014-08-26 23:15:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too old for that scene?
2014-08-26 23:15:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just don't think I'd want to be watching a show while rolling
2014-08-26 23:16:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've rolled at raves
2014-08-26 23:16:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and shit
2014-08-26 23:16:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and every time I just ended up sitting and talking most of the time
2014-08-26 23:16:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's what I'd rather be doing
2014-08-26 23:17:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm that's fair
2014-08-26 23:17:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe a festival then
2014-08-26 23:18:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A mix of sitting/talking/loving and awesome music/lights
2014-08-26 23:19:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I think a freedom to just do whatever is key for me
2014-08-26 23:23:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't think it'd be weird if I was rolling and you weren't?
2014-08-26 23:23:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not at all
2014-08-26 23:23:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd prefer that to you being drunk and me not
2014-08-26 23:24:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Something that maybe happens too often :/
2014-08-26 23:25:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's all good
2014-08-26 23:25:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't implying I had a problem with it
2014-08-26 23:32:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't even really like being drunk
2014-08-26 23:33:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There are quite a few states of being i'd pick over it
2014-08-26 23:35:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just happens to be the best one available most times?
2014-08-26 23:36:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or the only one available except sobriety 
2014-08-26 23:36:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like i drink mostly from boredom unless it's something I genuinely like the taste of 
2014-08-26 23:41:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Interesting. I guess that's the case for most people, though?
2014-08-26 23:41:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like people drink when they're together to avoid boredom.
2014-08-26 23:41:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think a fair amount of people actually enjoy being drunk  
2014-08-26 23:42:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or else it wouldn't really be a thing
2014-08-26 23:42:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think "being drunk" is really a thing outside of undergrads and high schoolers.
2014-08-26 23:44:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude so not true
2014-08-26 23:47:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]AA if nothing else proves that false
2014-08-26 23:49:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that doesn't prove they like being drunk
2014-08-26 23:49:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it proves they're addicted to alcohol
2014-08-26 23:49:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and being drunk is so tied up with our culture that it's impossible to say how much people actually like it
2014-08-26 23:50:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like people think a story of someone vomiting because they drank too much is hilarious
2014-08-26 23:50:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if you vomit because you're on any other drug it's really seriosu
2014-08-26 23:52:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Being drunk and being wasted to the point of sickness  are 2 different things
2014-08-26 23:52:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't know where to draw the line
2014-08-26 23:58:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tipsy<Drunk<Wasted
2014-08-26 23:58:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooooohhhhh
2014-08-26 23:59:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol sorry
2014-08-27 00:08:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-08-27 00:10:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too. I think I'll go to bed.
2014-08-27 00:13:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmmk
2014-08-27 00:13:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight sugah
2014-08-27 00:29:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One of my favorite music producers, with a very bassy feel doing a live show stream   https://screen.yahoo.com/live-nation/feed-live-concert-170000776.html
2014-08-27 00:29:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In case you can't sleep
2014-08-27 08:42:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've seen Feed Me a couple of times.
2014-08-27 08:43:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pretty sick.
2014-08-27 08:54:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had the worst night of sleep since getting back from the coast
2014-08-27 08:54:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😞 
2014-08-27 08:54:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What was wrong?
2014-08-27 08:54:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I couldn't fall asleep
2014-08-27 08:55:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You don't know why?
2014-08-27 08:55:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I tried everything: herbal tea, PvZ, masturbating
2014-08-27 08:55:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-08-27 08:55:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just brain on overdrive I guess
2014-08-27 08:55:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I get the occasional insomnia
2014-08-27 08:56:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But then after I finally did go to sleep the cat woke my up purring and wanting pets
2014-08-27 08:56:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At 5a
2014-08-27 08:56:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ouch
2014-08-27 09:08:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Officially called in the credit card as lost
2014-08-27 09:08:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]RIP
2014-08-27 09:09:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm about to get some groceries
2014-08-27 09:09:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need to get a moving truck for Sunday too.
2014-08-27 09:09:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is there a Uhaul place near you?
2014-08-27 09:10:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, 1.0 mile
2014-08-27 09:10:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-08-27 09:11:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wanna do me a favor?
2014-08-27 09:12:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yes.
2014-08-27 09:12:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-08-27 09:19:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you make a post on the Chicago Craigslist for a 3-Day North Coast pass for $180 under your email? I need to get this shot sold and have already used up my emails  
2014-08-27 09:19:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*shit
2014-08-27 09:21:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then forward any emails to me? 
2014-08-27 09:21:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-08-27 09:21:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The body could say something like: Selling a 3-day North Coast Music Festival pass for $180 or best offer. Can email ticket or deliver hard tickets in person. Accepts Paypal/Google Wallet/Chase Quickpay or cash if in person.
2014-08-27 09:21:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You might be better off doing StubHub
2014-08-27 09:22:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] I've never used stubhub
2014-08-27 09:22:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll try that!
2014-08-27 09:25:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That shit is close!
2014-08-27 09:25:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought it was later.
2014-08-27 09:27:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-08-27 09:28:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I shouldve put them up sooner
2014-08-27 09:28:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://chicago.craigslist.org/chc/tix/4639425823.html
2014-08-27 09:33:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks honey. If I haven't sold it by 3p I'll do stubhub. 
2014-08-27 09:34:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since it's so close they're making me give the tickets to them. And if they don't sell them I pick them up the event day
2014-08-27 09:34:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]StubHub?
2014-08-27 09:35:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-08-27 09:35:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-08-27 09:35:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or do you think they'll definitely sell it?
2014-08-27 09:35:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know.
2014-08-27 09:40:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bleghhhh
2014-08-27 09:41:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Your odds are probably good because you're selling them for a lot cheaper than the other posts.
2014-08-27 09:42:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah but I've had it up for $200 since Sunday and only one person responded
2014-08-27 09:43:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant on StubHub
2014-08-27 09:43:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you choose your price on stubhub?
2014-08-27 09:43:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah
2014-08-27 09:44:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's the general price there?
2014-08-27 09:44:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]> $350
2014-08-27 09:45:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh well shit
2014-08-27 09:45:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you had to sell face value
2014-08-27 09:46:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-08-27 09:46:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just like craigslist
2014-08-27 09:46:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except they take a cut
2014-08-27 09:46:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's way more convenient/secure
2014-08-27 09:58:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well as an honest seller, Craigslist is pretty secure. But even with a cut id make more of a profit selling for $250 on stubhub
2014-08-27 09:58:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just got three emails on craigslist.
2014-08-27 09:58:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Forward!
2014-08-27 10:45:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You sell them yet?
2014-08-27 10:46:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had to get my computer so not yet
2014-08-27 10:56:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok you can take it down!
2014-08-27 10:56:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry for the spam haha I'm sure you loved it
2014-08-27 11:01:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just don't know how you didn't sell it before.
2014-08-27 11:01:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe posting at the beginning of the day. Yesterday at 7p there was some on there for $150
2014-08-27 11:02:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if you get buried under posts people don't see it?
2014-08-27 11:04:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah maybe.
2014-08-27 11:05:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's more what I'm used to when I post stuff on the Chicago Craigslist.
2014-08-27 12:29:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miss you!
2014-08-27 12:29:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just thinking the same thing!
2014-08-27 12:29:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And you are so effing pretty.
2014-08-27 12:30:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's the lighting
2014-08-27 12:30:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😊
2014-08-27 12:30:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely just the lighting
2014-08-27 12:31:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I am ALL about that titty pic
2014-08-27 12:32:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All of you except your penis apparently 
2014-08-27 12:32:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-08-27 12:37:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just called this dude about a bike and he gave me his life story.
2014-08-27 12:38:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did he agree to sell you the bike?
2014-08-27 12:39:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, but after giving me his address and shit he tells me the tires are flat
2014-08-27 12:39:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm looking for a different one
2014-08-27 12:39:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he's not selling it for all that good of a deal
2014-08-27 12:45:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll find one
2014-08-27 12:46:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what's your address?
2014-08-27 12:46:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]632 W Belt Line Rd Richardson, TX 75080
2014-08-27 13:12:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How fast do you think you can bike comfortably?
2014-08-27 13:12:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I have no idea
2014-08-27 13:12:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably not very for prolonged periods of time
2014-08-27 13:13:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can do about 6 pretty easily for like 10
2014-08-27 13:13:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]6 mph?
2014-08-27 13:13:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]6 min/mile
2014-08-27 13:14:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so 10 MPH?
2014-08-27 13:14:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-08-27 13:15:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I got to the Field Museum in like 40 mins
2014-08-27 13:15:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from my apartment
2014-08-27 13:15:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that was 7.3 miles if I remember right
2014-08-27 13:16:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found a great hotel, good location and outdoor pool. It's $50 a night for a room with 2 double beds or 100 for a room with a King
2014-08-27 13:16:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wtf
2014-08-27 13:16:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]high demand for the big sex bed
2014-08-27 13:16:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it worth it? 
2014-08-27 13:17:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha not for me
2014-08-27 13:17:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is it worth it for you?
2014-08-27 13:17:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean the $50 for a double
2014-08-27 13:17:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, yeah that's good
2014-08-27 13:18:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We won't get a big bed
2014-08-27 13:18:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's ok

2014-08-27 13:18:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-08-27 13:19:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To see how far away you'd be from school

2014-08-27 13:19:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely worth buying a bike
2014-08-27 13:20:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I meant with the hotel
2014-08-27 13:20:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooh, haha

2014-08-27 13:37:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's 12 miles from the airport
2014-08-27 13:37:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I could get a shuttle I guess and leave at 6am
2014-08-27 13:37:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or get a closer hotel, up to you
2014-08-27 13:38:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*for the last night

2014-08-27 13:38:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-08-27 13:39:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I lost it again.
2014-08-27 13:39:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I went to change the dates and it was gone.
2014-08-27 13:40:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I went straight to the hotel's website
2014-08-27 13:40:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's the difference between a king suite and and a king bed?
2014-08-27 13:41:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]King suite has more shit in it I guess
2014-08-27 13:41:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]One king bed $44/night
2014-08-27 13:41:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hahahahaha

2014-08-27 13:42:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it doesnt matter

2014-08-27 13:45:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely something to keep in mind in the future
2014-08-27 13:45:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]check out the actual websites of hotels
2014-08-27 13:46:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't give me shit about looking up the hotel
2014-08-27 13:46:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]???
2014-08-27 13:46:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or how I go about doing it, mister
2014-08-27 13:46:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though obviously you have a point
2014-08-27 13:48:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It just felt like you were being a little patronizing
2014-08-27 13:52:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry, I was more making an observation.
2014-08-27 13:52:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For my own benefit as well.
2014-08-27 13:52:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you and I'm going to marry you.
2014-08-27 13:53:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should save that line for when I'm actually annoyed at you hahahaha
2014-08-27 13:53:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha ok.
2014-08-27 13:53:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The reservation is confirmed, though. So we got that trip booked!
2014-08-27 13:53:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whew
2014-08-27 13:54:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll book some shuttles. Meet you in da hotel lobby
2014-08-27 13:54:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha ok
2014-08-27 13:55:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]People are so silly with their requirements for hard copy tickets
2014-08-27 13:56:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]as if that's less likely to get you scammed
2014-08-27 13:56:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When obviously if it's a transaction over Paypal you can sue my ass if I sell you fake tickets. If it's a cash transaction then there's no way to catch me
2014-08-27 13:57:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, kinda silly.
2014-08-27 13:57:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's comforting having something physical?
2014-08-27 13:57:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Even if it's not real comfort.
2014-08-27 13:57:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone, or a group of someones, got really good at making fake hologram ultra tickets last year
2014-08-27 13:58:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ripped a bunch of people off including my friend
2014-08-27 13:58:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bummer
2014-08-27 13:58:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I don't think I've ever bought tickets on Craigslist
2014-08-27 13:58:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just seems to easy to scam people
2014-08-27 14:01:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might pick up a Friday ticket for $50 and go with my friemd Priya
2014-08-27 14:01:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ughhhhh but I have no $$
2014-08-27 14:01:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, you have some now.
2014-08-27 14:01:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or more than you did before.
2014-08-27 14:02:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It means I get to see bassnectar+plus for $45
2014-08-27 14:02:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I still don't got that rent
2014-08-27 14:03:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for September?
2014-08-27 14:03:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah, I have to pay $1300 because Darcy covered all of August
2014-08-27 14:03:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]shiiit
2014-08-27 14:05:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anyways I'm gonna quit whining and start doing actual work    😃

2014-08-27 15:53:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This has to be the least productive day I've ever spent in an office 
2014-08-27 15:54:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha just couldn't get anything done?
2014-08-27 15:57:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I keep getting distracted I guess. And I volunteered to update the new student guide and that took forever
2014-08-27 15:57:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's productive!
2014-08-27 16:00:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not the reading I needed to do though lol
2014-08-27 16:00:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like how the image for our video is you shirtless 
2014-08-27 16:02:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP];)
2014-08-27 16:02:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gives me a little tingle
2014-08-27 16:03:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like how the background for my phone is you shirtless.
2014-08-27 16:04:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not funny!
2014-08-27 16:05:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘
2014-08-27 16:07:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I dont care that much what anyone at UT-D would think 
2014-08-27 16:07:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just dont let your dad see it lol
2014-08-27 16:10:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK. It is quite aesthetically pleasing!
2014-08-27 16:11:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not sure my breasts have ever been called aesthetically pleasing before
2014-08-27 16:17:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Man the teaching quality here is BAD
2014-08-27 16:19:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your field has historically not required communication skills to be successful
2014-08-27 16:20:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]True this is my bioinformatics class, though.
2014-08-27 16:26:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you know about all that?
2014-08-27 16:27:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Digestive disorders, yes
2014-08-27 16:27:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Makes sense
2014-08-27 16:28:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm now kind of grateful to my mom that she never took me to the doctor when i had fevers lol
2014-08-27 16:28:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha just toughening you up!
2014-08-27 16:29:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't remember ever going to the doctor except for checkups and checking sports injuries.
2014-08-27 16:33:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously I got a lot of strep
2014-08-27 16:34:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you have your tonsils?
2014-08-27 16:35:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-08-27 16:35:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No one suggested to my mother I should get them out
2014-08-27 16:35:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Interesting.
2014-08-27 16:36:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My quality of life has been declining rapidly.
2014-08-27 16:37:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Darling!
2014-08-27 16:37:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What can I do to make it better?
2014-08-27 16:38:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nothing unfortunately.
2014-08-27 16:38:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Challenge accepted 
2014-08-27 16:38:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha

2014-08-27 20:08:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's really not that bad 
2014-08-27 20:09:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we could totes be cuffing watching fireworks right now
2014-08-27 20:09:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuffing?
2014-08-27 20:09:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha cuddling
2014-08-27 20:09:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess we could be play fighting too ;)
2014-08-27 20:10:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, yeah that'd be perfect
2014-08-27 20:10:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking today that it makes me really uncomfortable that I'm going to be spending most of the next several months away from you
2014-08-27 20:10:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just such a bummer
2014-08-27 20:11:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, 3 months pretty much
2014-08-27 20:12:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which is nothing compared to 60+ years pending good health 
2014-08-27 20:14:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-08-27 20:43:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's why the building said Go JR West!
2014-08-27 20:44:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oooh. I even knew they were playing.
2014-08-27 20:44:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or had been playing.
2014-08-27 20:45:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dropped the ball
2014-08-27 20:45:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You might call that... an error
2014-08-27 20:45:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ooooooooohhhhhhh
2014-08-27 20:46:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😝 
2014-08-27 20:47:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Watching Georgia State?
2014-08-27 20:47:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no
2014-08-27 20:48:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm picking up my dad from the airport at 10
2014-08-27 20:48:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gotta leave around 9:30 probably
2014-08-27 20:48:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Last days of free transportation 
2014-08-27 20:48:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeppp
2014-08-27 21:25:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The bitch who said she'd buy my ticket when she got off work isn't responding

2014-08-27 21:25:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Grrr...
2014-08-27 21:25:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Craigslist is such a pain in the ass sometimes.
2014-08-27 21:25:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Reach out to those other people maybe?
2014-08-27 21:25:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Give people ultimatum's going forward.
2014-08-27 21:26:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ultimatums
2014-08-27 21:26:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You have to treat Craigslist people like children
2014-08-27 21:29:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I know
2014-08-27 21:29:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was too trusting 
2014-08-27 22:28:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Say hi to your dad for me
2014-08-27 22:59:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.reddit.com/r/aww/comments/2er1p2/girlfriends_mice_tangle_their_tails_when_cuddling/
2014-08-27 23:00:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dawww
2014-08-27 23:01:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And my dad says "hello"
2014-08-27 23:02:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you guys up to?
2014-08-27 23:03:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just checked in to the hotel.
2014-08-27 23:04:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're staying with him?
2014-08-27 23:05:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. Might as well!
2014-08-27 23:06:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-08-27 23:06:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No video chat though :(((
2014-08-27 23:06:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha just kidding, I won't be home for another 20 min
2014-08-27 23:06:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This was a much longer event than advertised
2014-08-27 23:09:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you have fun, though?
2014-08-27 23:13:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My phone might die and don't have a cord
2014-08-27 23:13:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!
2014-08-27 23:32:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found a charger!
2014-08-27 23:38:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was mostly fun, with some meh parts. There was little to no vegetarian food options, so Supriya and Laura were understandably pissed. There was a lot of waiting around, and it was surprisingly chilly. Seeing the skyline from the lake was really nice though and the fireworks had a few I had never seen before.
2014-08-27 23:39:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Supriya also told me on the walk home my drunkenness at Halloween "shocked her"
2014-08-27 23:39:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-08-27 23:40:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Dave's girlfriend too (who I knew disliked me!) So she'll be in for a treat when we're on a bunch if drugs this year ;) 
2014-08-27 23:40:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There were fireworks you hadn't seen before?
2014-08-27 23:41:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, quadfurcatimg stars and these spiraling, almost fluffy ones
2014-08-27 23:41:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What about Dave's girlfriend?
2014-08-27 23:42:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She apparently talked negatively to Supriya about how drunk I was at Halloween 
2014-08-27 23:42:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bitches need to chill yo
2014-08-27 23:42:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha. You definitely got yourself a reputation didn't you?
2014-08-27 23:43:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Those fireworks sound cool!
2014-08-27 23:44:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Psh I wasn't even the drunkest person there. Nobody gives Roberto shit when he passes out or Haley shit when she's sick.
2014-08-27 23:45:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you really get a lot of shit?
2014-08-27 23:46:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, mostly silent judgement I guess. Which is worse in my opinion
2014-08-27 23:46:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I guess everyone in the department gets gossiped about in some way or another 
2014-08-27 23:47:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Seems to be that way. I wonder if I was ever gossiped about.
2014-08-27 23:47:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I for sure am not I guess!
2014-08-27 23:47:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably had a nice peak in January/March haha
2014-08-27 23:48:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You for sure are not what?
2014-08-27 23:48:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*now not not
2014-08-27 23:48:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I for sure am gossiped about now.
2014-08-27 23:48:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ah
2014-08-27 23:48:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you also aren't in the dept anymore
2014-08-27 23:49:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think people's interest in us has waned
2014-08-27 23:49:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know. Which makes me ripe for the picking right?
2014-08-27 23:49:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're old news
2014-08-27 23:49:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that's good.
2014-08-27 23:50:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Any interpreted scandal has been put to rest
2014-08-27 23:50:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Katie's days of hooking up with every man in the department have come to an end
2014-08-27 23:50:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, we're pretty adorable at this point, which is very bad for gossip.
2014-08-27 23:50:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Totes bad
2014-08-27 23:51:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha have I tamed the wild woman? ;)
2014-08-27 23:51:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh I don't like the sound of that lol
2014-08-27 23:52:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did tell everyone there tonight you're coming to chicago in May
2014-08-27 23:53:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? That's a big announcement!
2014-08-27 23:54:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well Matt Smith (dude in my cohort who does computational theoretical ecology) asked what you were going to do after your Masters.
2014-08-27 23:55:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you'd get along with him really well actually. His wife is super fun too.
2014-08-27 23:55:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice.
2014-08-27 23:55:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it too soon to be telling people? Am I jinxing it?
2014-08-27 23:56:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha maybe a slight jinx, but I like that you're excited about it.
2014-08-27 23:57:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck, I've ruined everything 
2014-08-27 23:58:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Welp, it was nice while it lasted!
2014-08-27 23:58:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#OffToThePeaceCorps
2014-08-27 23:59:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can we at least pretend until Disney World? That's all I really cared about anyways
2014-08-27 23:59:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha, fine.
2014-08-27 23:59:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Talked a little about Disney tonight. Definitely plenty of details to work out.
2014-08-28 00:00:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like?
2014-08-28 00:00:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How many days at the parks and how we're gonna do that.
2014-08-28 00:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm really excited to be there with you, even though it'll mark the end of our relationship.
2014-08-28 00:02:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sign off with a bang
2014-08-28 00:02:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Now we're talking ;)
2014-08-28 00:02:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How are we gonna fit all those ppl in a timeshare?
2014-08-28 00:03:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lolll you've been on your punny game today
2014-08-28 00:03:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No idea. It's gonna be cozy and lacking sex most likely.
2014-08-28 00:04:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which will be interesting to see.
2014-08-28 00:04:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm ok with that. Will I get to cuddle you?
2014-08-28 00:04:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-08-28 00:04:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes!
2014-08-28 00:04:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We'll probably figure out some sexiness.
2014-08-28 00:05:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] That cements my idea of us getting a room together a day before.
2014-08-28 00:05:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]More like sements
2014-08-28 00:05:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause trying to go 5 days with little to no sex after not seeing each other for a month will be impossible 
2014-08-28 00:05:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahahaha
2014-08-28 00:06:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ahhhhhh
2014-08-28 00:06:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Agreed
2014-08-28 00:06:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I will bang you in an Epcot bathroom before that happens
2014-08-28 00:08:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm hoping for a hand job on Alien Encounter.
2014-08-28 00:09:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only if you lick my pussy on Space Mountain 
2014-08-28 00:09:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha deal.
2014-08-28 00:10:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm definitely gonna be bending you over if we ever get a moment alone.
2014-08-28 00:10:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes please
2014-08-28 00:11:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)

2014-08-28 00:15:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If only so I could destroy you
2014-08-28 00:15:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You gonna be top scorer?
2014-08-28 00:16:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obvs

2014-08-28 00:17:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha probably chic cuz I'm always beating you ;)
2014-08-28 00:25:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our monopoly game isn't over 
2014-08-28 00:26:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've beaten me twice at trivial pursuit
2014-08-28 00:29:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK . I'm falling asleep... I love you!
2014-08-28 00:29:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-08-28 00:29:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet dreams my dear
2014-08-28 01:32:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Trouble sleeping again, even though I'm exhausted. Can only think it's because I'm not lying next to you. I miss you so much.
2014-08-28 09:50:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, my love! I miss you too. I wish I could sleep with you in my arms every night.
2014-08-28 11:01:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Put up a new Craigslist post this morning and still nothing. What the fuck
2014-08-28 11:08:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe my spam filters are being lame?
2014-08-28 11:33:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I don't know. Did you check your spam folder?
2014-08-28 11:51:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I sold my Saturday, and bought an extra Friday....
2014-08-28 11:55:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm this seems to not be going according to plan!
2014-08-28 11:56:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhhhhhhggggggggggggbcbnj
2014-08-28 11:56:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my eyes are bloodshot from not sleeping 
2014-08-28 11:56:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need cuddles now!

2014-08-28 12:02:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to right now?
2014-08-28 12:03:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]At The Pub on campus with my dad.
2014-08-28 12:04:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's a pub?
2014-08-28 12:04:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's surprising 
2014-08-28 12:04:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They don't serve beer until 5:00 PM and there's a two drink limit lol
2014-08-28 12:04:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ah
2014-08-28 13:52:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Score!

2014-08-28 13:53:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Almost?
2014-08-28 13:54:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Waiting on Chase Quickpay lol

2014-08-28 17:42:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do y'all raise your arms like that?
2014-08-28 17:43:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They don't have arms
2014-08-28 17:43:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only wrists in that emoji
2014-08-28 17:43:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha what?
2014-08-28 17:44:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No arms
2014-08-28 17:45:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Weird! They look different on my phone.

2014-08-28 17:49:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuckin' android
2014-08-28 17:49:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am so incredibly tired 
2014-08-28 17:49:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I'm gonna make it through laser tag
2014-08-28 17:52:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like you're making excuses in case you don't tear it up ;)
2014-08-28 17:52:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's not my style
2014-08-28 17:52:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I make post excuses
2014-08-28 17:54:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-08-28 18:08:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No ones is wearing laser tag blacks 
2014-08-28 18:08:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I clearly over prepared
2014-08-28 18:10:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha I love you so much.
2014-08-28 21:01:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got highest scorer once
2014-08-28 21:08:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So not toooo bad

2014-08-28 21:09:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A&M vs. South Carolina was a blowout
2014-08-28 21:10:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A&am?
2014-08-28 21:12:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You call yourself a Texan?
2014-08-28 21:17:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is that a challenge, or a legitimate question?
2014-08-28 21:48:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha both I guess!
2014-08-28 21:48:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sorry, my phone died
2014-08-28 21:49:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A&M is Texas A&M, though
2014-08-28 21:49:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the Aggies
2014-08-28 21:50:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess laser tag was fun?
2014-08-28 22:02:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was!
2014-08-28 22:02:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wanna talk to youuu
2014-08-28 22:03:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I know you're busy
2014-08-28 22:05:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm an aggie hater for sure
2014-08-28 22:06:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can talk!
2014-08-28 22:07:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now? I don't wanna cut into father son time 
2014-08-28 22:07:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my dad left
2014-08-28 22:09:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why'd you hang up on me :((((((
2014-08-28 22:09:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Shit. I started Windows with my headphones plugged in.
2014-08-28 22:09:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Go ahead and call me again
2014-08-28 22:09:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll just use my phone.
2014-08-28 23:45:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's hard for me to just chill with you on the phone sometimes. Like the equivalent of when I have lags in texting you back.
2014-08-28 23:45:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Something I can work on
2014-08-28 23:47:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't follow.
2014-08-28 23:50:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When the conversation lags while talking on the phone, or when I tell you a story and don't get a response, it can be a little frustrating. Or make me less inclined to continuing the conversation. And I imagine that's how it feels to you when we're having a texting conversation and I stop responding because I become busy
2014-08-28 23:52:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah. I didn't realize I wasn't responding.
2014-08-28 23:53:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But yeah, the silence is one of the reasons I don't like talking on the phone.
2014-08-28 23:53:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't like feeling obligated to constantly be talking.
2014-08-28 23:53:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's how I feel about texting! 
2014-08-28 23:54:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we're just incompatible.
2014-08-28 23:54:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's just funny
2014-08-28 23:54:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How we approach different communication methods
2014-08-28 23:54:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Video is obviously ideal
2014-08-28 23:55:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll bring my computer home more often
2014-08-28 23:55:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh is that why we were on the phone? I was wondering.
2014-08-28 23:58:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why do you want a monogamous relationship?
2014-08-28 23:59:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A little out of the blue
2014-08-29 00:00:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I know. I don't actually want to get into it.
2014-08-29 00:00:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because:  1) you make me more satisfied emotionally, mentally, and physically than any man I've ever met.
2014-08-29 00:00:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why are you thinking about it?
2014-08-29 00:01:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's just something I occasionally think about.
2014-08-29 00:01:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Think about, or worry about?
2014-08-29 00:01:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]One in the same haha
2014-08-29 00:03:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I lost you or hurt you, my entire world would collapse. No casual curiosity is worth that to me. 
2014-08-29 00:03:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If my attitude changes, you'll be the first to know
2014-08-29 00:04:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But, in an ideal world, you'd be able to explore those curiosities without worry, right?
2014-08-29 00:06:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The only situation where I could see myself wanting some form of polygamy is of I met another person I really connected with and felt that if I didn't get to know them further then I'd be making a huge mistake.
2014-08-29 00:07:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think those people are very common, and I have zero desire to actively seek anyone else out
2014-08-29 00:10:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I conceptually like the idea of being open to nontraditional relationships, but I don't know if I'd actually enjoy it in practice 
2014-08-29 00:12:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why not?
2014-08-29 00:14:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because, being even partially responsible for the emotions of one person is already intense. Juggling it with two people would more likely fail than not.
2014-08-29 00:16:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to spend the rest of my life with you. 
2014-08-29 00:16:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're the man I want to grow with
2014-08-29 00:17:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To explore the world with 
2014-08-29 00:19:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If one day a situation comes up where I want to change the parameters of our relationship, we can talk about it. But there's literally no reason to worry about hypothetical issues.
2014-08-29 00:20:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not really worried about it I guess.
2014-08-29 00:20:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're enriching my life in so many ways, not holding me back
2014-08-29 00:20:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. I guess that's all I want.
2014-08-29 00:21:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just have a hard time squaring some of your personal beliefs with monogamy.
2014-08-29 00:22:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I guess you'll bring it up if it's ever an issue, which is all I can ask for.
2014-08-29 00:22:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pinkie swear
2014-08-29 00:23:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Please try not to worry about it though? 
2014-08-29 00:24:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not worried about it.
2014-08-29 00:25:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A partial lie, but I'll take it
2014-08-29 00:28:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tell me how much you love and miss me. I haven't heard my quota yet today 
2014-08-29 00:30:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, well, I sure do love you and miss you a whole lot.
2014-08-29 00:31:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought about holding you hand at the bar today and that made me miss you a lot.
2014-08-29 00:31:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss being around you.
2014-08-29 00:31:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you smiling at me.
2014-08-29 00:32:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss talking to you all day.
2014-08-29 00:32:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss the way you look up at me in various scenarios.
2014-08-29 00:32:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All that jazz.
2014-08-29 00:32:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought about how you asked if we would have an apt warming party after we moved in together, and it made me smile because secretly I've been thinking about that possibility for over a month now. 
2014-08-29 00:33:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like how you think about that stuff too
2014-08-29 00:33:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha aw. Not even surprised, though.
2014-08-29 00:34:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What can I say, I'm a clingy creep
2014-08-29 00:35:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha one man's clingy creep is another man's dream girl.
2014-08-29 00:36:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Time for me to play some PvZ and try to sleep though. I'm pretty ragged. Why do you always have to bring up challenging text conversations when I'm exhausted? ;)
2014-08-29 00:36:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I'm sorry. They come to me at night I guess.
2014-08-29 00:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When all good existential crises take place.
2014-08-29 00:38:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Seriously, the last time we talked about this topic I was coming off of 30+ hours of no sleep and drugs. Then we hashed out our relationship history after the 18 hour drive/boating day
2014-08-29 00:38:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I LOVE YOU
2014-08-29 00:38:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Put it on a sticky note by your computer
2014-08-29 00:39:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I should. I gotta put your postcards on display somewhere.
2014-08-29 00:40:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll make a cute little bulletin board next May
2014-08-29 00:40:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Actually, that it not really in my skill set at all
2014-08-29 00:40:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha no?
2014-08-29 00:41:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Arts and crafts and decorating, not as much
2014-08-29 00:41:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have all the sentiment and ideas, but little skill 
2014-08-29 00:41:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, I'm sure we'll manage.
2014-08-29 00:42:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh!
2014-08-29 00:42:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My dad said you complement my flaws.
2014-08-29 00:42:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wasn't sure what he meant by that, but I agree with the statement.
2014-08-29 00:43:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Compliment, or complement?
2014-08-29 00:43:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Complement.
2014-08-29 00:43:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What are your flaws? Other than the fact your "psychotic" lol
2014-08-29 00:44:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know, that's what I'm saying.
2014-08-29 00:44:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean, I do have a sense for my flaws, but not what my dad perceives are my flaws.
2014-08-29 00:46:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woah. That's a strange concept. I don't know if I'm ready to know what my parents' think my flaws are.
2014-08-29 00:46:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah, probably best to not know.
2014-08-29 00:47:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I take that as high praise  
2014-08-29 00:48:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good!
2014-08-29 00:48:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think you complement my flaws?
2014-08-29 00:48:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe.
2014-08-29 00:49:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd rather not call them flaws.
2014-08-29 00:49:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah? What do you perceive as some of my flaws? 
2014-08-29 00:49:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think certain aspects of my personality complement certain aspects of your personality.
2014-08-29 00:51:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think my pessimism and skepticism is useful for certain things.
2014-08-29 00:51:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I think your optimism and more laid back approach is good for me in a lot of situations.
2014-08-29 00:52:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha true, I can be a little too trusting/naive about a lot of situations.
2014-08-29 00:52:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love the way you put things
2014-08-29 00:53:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You always seem to try to avoid phrasing something in a way that might offend or hurt me
2014-08-29 00:55:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I'm glad you appreciate it. It's really not calculated though. That's how I actually feel.
2014-08-29 00:56:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, but it is your natural way of speaking, about myself and other people you care about.
2014-08-29 00:56:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dudeeee I gotta sleep
2014-08-29 00:56:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK.
2014-08-29 00:56:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah
2014-08-29 00:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘
2014-08-29 00:57:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What does that look like to you?
2014-08-29 00:57:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I've been living a lie.
2014-08-29 00:59:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ew, that's so ugly.
2014-08-29 00:59:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Mine are way more aesthetically pleasing.
2014-08-29 01:00:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like mine way more
2014-08-29 01:00:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yours look like they're from PacMan
2014-08-29 01:00:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yours look like tacky 90s web icons.
2014-08-29 01:01:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whatttttt
2014-08-29 01:01:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Look at my snap
2014-08-29 01:01:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What did that look like?
2014-08-29 01:02:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did. It's adorable. I saved it.
2014-08-29 01:03:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A GIF
2014-08-29 01:03:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-08-29 01:03:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K goodnight
2014-08-29 01:03:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Goodnight. I love you.
2014-08-29 01:03:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴
2014-08-29 01:03:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😺😸😻😽😼🙀😿😹😾
2014-08-29 01:04:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send me a pic of the cat icons first
2014-08-29 01:04:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Such a goofball.
2014-08-29 01:04:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A true test of graphical masterpiece 
2014-08-29 01:05:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This is what I see when I go to attach a photo.
2014-08-29 01:05:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate them
2014-08-29 01:06:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those are some damn fine titties
2014-08-29 01:07:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No doubt. I want them in my mouth every time I see that pic.
2014-08-29 01:07:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Save that, one day when they're saggy and wrinkly you'll appreciate it haha
2014-08-29 01:07:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh it's saved.
2014-08-29 01:08:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I appreciate it now.
2014-08-29 01:09:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight my love
2014-08-29 01:10:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have lots of dreams about sucking my tits while massaging my clit
2014-08-29 01:10:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know I will
2014-08-29 01:11:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet dreams, my Katie!
2014-08-29 01:11:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yummmm
2014-08-29 10:02:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Heavy thunderstorms all day
2014-08-29 10:03:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like a good day for some cuddling.
2014-08-29 10:03:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But not a good day for a music festival
2014-08-29 10:03:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-08-29 10:04:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Take a poncho I guess!
2014-08-29 10:08:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You have my poncho!
2014-08-29 10:08:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I can buy a new one
2014-08-29 10:09:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you sleep better last night?
2014-08-29 10:10:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ehhh a little bit
2014-08-29 10:10:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woke up a bunch, and still feel like a train hit me
2014-08-29 10:10:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But better I guess
2014-08-29 10:11:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeesh, doesn't sound like much of an improvement
2014-08-29 10:11:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why do you feel like a train hit you?
2014-08-29 10:12:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]From poor sleep
2014-08-29 10:12:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah. I'm sorry    😞 
2014-08-29 10:12:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like the opposite of waking up well rested
2014-08-29 10:12:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😕 
2014-08-29 10:12:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do your emojis look like mine when you're on the computer?
2014-08-29 10:12:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's ok, I think I might go back to sleep soon
2014-08-29 10:13:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like a good idea
2014-08-29 10:13:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No they look like yours 
2014-08-29 10:15:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you. I hope you get some solid sleep.
2014-08-29 10:17:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miss you too
2014-08-29 10:48:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I'm sleeping poorly because I'm having ~300% fewer orgasms per day
2014-08-29 10:48:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wouldn't be surprised if that was a contributing factor.
2014-08-29 10:49:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's got to be a significantly different composition of hormones and neural stimulation levels going on
2014-08-29 10:50:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No doubt.
2014-08-29 10:50:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.chatelaine.com/health/sex-and-relationships/five-unexpected-health-benefits-of-orgasms/
2014-08-29 10:50:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause we were getting like 10 hours of sleep a night and taking naps 
2014-08-29 10:51:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think woman have 11 different types of orgasm
2014-08-29 10:51:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Physiologically at least
2014-08-29 10:51:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even know what that means.
2014-08-29 10:51:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you have at least two, right?
2014-08-29 10:53:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.salon.com/2014/03/19/how_many_types_of_orgasm_can_women_really_have_partner/
2014-08-29 10:54:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's pretty wild.
2014-08-29 10:54:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Does one feel better than the other?
2014-08-29 10:55:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's only 3 people though, and is that realistically recreating sex?
2014-08-29 10:56:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, the article mentions that.
2014-08-29 10:56:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And where does vaginal penetration plus clitoral stimulation come into play?
2014-08-29 10:56:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]True.
2014-08-29 10:57:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So how many orgasms do you have then?
2014-08-29 11:01:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm, an orgasm from just vaginal stimulation (as in my clit hasn't really been touched and isn't rubbing on anything during sex) is relatively rare and probably the most "gentle" of the orgasms 
2014-08-29 11:01:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It may not actually even be a full orgasm, just getting really close to one.
2014-08-29 11:02:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then an orgasm from a vibrator/just external stimulation definitely feels different than an orgasm where you're inside of me  
2014-08-29 11:03:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And when I feel myself "gush" that's also a slightly different sensation
2014-08-29 11:03:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I dunno
2014-08-29 11:04:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still pretty wild
2014-08-29 11:04:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one isn't necessarily better than the others, though?
2014-08-29 11:06:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you're behind me and im touching my clit, those are the most intense
2014-08-29 11:06:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And after I've already had an orgasm
2014-08-29 11:07:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word.
2014-08-29 11:07:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thinking about your orgasming is definitely turning me on a bit.
2014-08-29 11:10:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would you prefer me being behind you more often?
2014-08-29 11:10:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah? I like that :)
2014-08-29 11:10:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you go down on the the perfect amount
2014-08-29 11:11:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do like when you finger me too, though which you don't always do
2014-08-29 11:11:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]while going down on you?
2014-08-29 11:12:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, or just in general when your touching me down there 
2014-08-29 11:12:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*you're
2014-08-29 11:12:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. I'll try to do that more.
2014-08-29 11:12:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You didn't answer my original question, thouh.
2014-08-29 11:12:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I misread it!
2014-08-29 11:13:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No way, I like our variety
2014-08-29 11:13:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-08-29 11:13:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to just be one of those couples that does the standard orgasm producing positions
2014-08-29 11:14:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]works for me    😃 
2014-08-29 11:14:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want some sexxxxxxx
2014-08-29 11:15:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This conversation definitely is turning me on
2014-08-29 11:20:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it would be fun to take some nude pics of you
2014-08-29 11:20:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!
2014-08-29 11:21:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I could maybe get down with that
2014-08-29 11:21:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It'd be sexy    😃 
2014-08-29 11:23:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd have to drink a glass of wine or two before
2014-08-29 11:23:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you think?
2014-08-29 11:23:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Getting my picture taken makes me a little self conscious 
2014-08-29 11:23:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I'm not very good at fake smiling
2014-08-29 11:24:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't need to smile
2014-08-29 11:24:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just act natural
2014-08-29 11:24:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you could get into it
2014-08-29 11:24:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]without a need for a drink
2014-08-29 11:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it might be awkward at first
2014-08-29 11:25:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think you'd get comfortable with it
2014-08-29 11:25:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you're very naturally sexy
2014-08-29 11:25:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it'd just be getting to that point would be the only barrier
2014-08-29 11:25:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where you let your natural sexiness come out
2014-08-29 11:26:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure you could get me there 
2014-08-29 11:26:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]agreed
2014-08-29 11:27:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love how sensual you can be, too
2014-08-29 11:27:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah? How so?
2014-08-29 11:30:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're the most sensual man I've ever met! The way to touch me and like being touched, the way you were just talking to me about letting my natural sexiness out
2014-08-29 11:31:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can make sex feel really romantic sometimes
2014-08-29 11:32:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, I'm glad.
2014-08-29 11:32:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sex with you is amazing.
2014-08-29 11:32:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's so fun and full of love.
2014-08-29 11:33:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's not all saccharine either
2014-08-29 11:33:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it can be really passionate and naughty
2014-08-29 11:33:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and aggressive at times
2014-08-29 11:33:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we've got a good mix
2014-08-29 11:34:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is what I'm saying
2014-08-29 11:34:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I completely, 100% agree
2014-08-29 11:35:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want it nowwww
2014-08-29 11:35:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too... believe me
2014-08-29 11:35:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want you now, I should say
2014-08-29 11:35:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw    😃 
2014-08-29 11:36:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna have to really focus on my work a lot
2014-08-29 11:36:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we have a couple of extended stretches
2014-08-29 11:37:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]over five weeks I think after your next visit
2014-08-29 11:37:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]4.5 I guess
2014-08-29 11:37:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then another four I guess
2014-08-29 11:38:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That'll be rough
2014-08-29 11:38:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should get busy soon though though
2014-08-29 11:38:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*too though
2014-08-29 11:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It sucks, cuz if we were even like 8 hours away from each other we could probably meet up halfway every couple of weeks
2014-08-29 11:39:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I start feeling really bad I'll just buy a ticket one weekend
2014-08-29 11:40:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]after making sure it's okay with you, of course
2014-08-29 11:42:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well after oct 15 I should have like 3 free round trip flights on SWA. So maybe we'll throw in another weekend 
2014-08-29 11:43:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is your class on Friday mandatory attendance?
2014-08-29 11:43:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably, but I could probably miss a class one week.
2014-08-29 11:43:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Depending on my classes it may make more sense for me to visit you
2014-08-29 11:44:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd work. I'd pay for the hotel.
2014-08-29 11:44:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have over 10k in the bank at the moment
2014-08-29 11:44:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1k is gonna be gone on Sep 1st
2014-08-29 11:44:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but still
2014-08-29 11:44:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]working part time
2014-08-29 11:45:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should have money to spend on us if we need more time
2014-08-29 11:45:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's something I'd gladly spend my money on
2014-08-29 11:45:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-08-29 11:45:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too
2014-08-29 11:45:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sooooo much
2014-08-29 11:45:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you contacted red hat about starting to work?
2014-08-29 11:46:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No, I'm gonna do that either today or Monday.
2014-08-29 11:46:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just don't have my shit settled right now.
2014-08-29 11:46:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I haven't really been particularly motivated to start that part yet.
2014-08-29 11:46:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Once my stuff is out of storage on Sunday I'll be settled.
2014-08-29 11:46:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I can get into a routine.
2014-08-29 11:47:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm just gonna stay on campus like 10 hours a day, though
2014-08-29 11:47:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and get my Red Hat work done and try to do as much as I can for my classes every day
2014-08-29 11:51:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you gonna bike to school today?
2014-08-29 11:52:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep!
2014-08-29 11:52:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not a blazing inferno out either
2014-08-29 11:52:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's nice
2014-08-29 11:52:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The ride is actually really easy
2014-08-29 11:52:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's one mostly residential street the whole way
2014-08-29 11:53:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How long did it take?
2014-08-29 11:53:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't done it yet
2014-08-29 11:53:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's 2.7 miles
2014-08-29 11:53:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Google Maps says 14 minutes
2014-08-29 11:54:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-08-29 11:54:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'm actually looking forward to it
2014-08-29 11:54:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can leave on my own schedule
2014-08-29 11:54:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]won't be on a crowded smelly bus
2014-08-29 11:54:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'll take way less time
2014-08-29 11:54:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty stress free because it's a residential street
2014-08-29 11:54:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-08-29 11:54:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'll take less time even then the bus ride I was taking last year
2014-08-29 11:55:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if Google Maps is accurate
2014-08-29 11:57:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm wondering if I should invest in a decent office chair
2014-08-29 11:57:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For school?
2014-08-29 11:57:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or just work on campus
2014-08-29 11:57:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for my room
2014-08-29 11:57:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have a desk
2014-08-29 11:57:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in my room
2014-08-29 11:57:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the chair is really shitty
2014-08-29 11:57:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd need something comfortable
2014-08-29 11:58:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you could work from home during the day and just bike to school for class.
2014-08-29 11:58:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless you don't think you'll be productive from home
2014-08-29 11:58:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's what I'm trying to decide on.
2014-08-29 11:58:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should probably just go to campus.
2014-08-29 11:58:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it'll be easier to manage my time that way.
2014-08-29 11:59:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is there a quiet place you can do video chats from there?
2014-08-29 12:00:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, there's a little TV room in the student union that'd be good for that
2014-08-29 12:00:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd actually probably be more comfortable videoing there than here
2014-08-29 12:00:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I have to be quiet and censor myself a bit here
2014-08-29 12:00:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did I tell you my room is right next to the dude's?
2014-08-29 12:00:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-08-29 12:01:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is he home during the day?
2014-08-29 12:01:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah he's home most of the time
2014-08-29 12:01:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]his little business is run out of his house
2014-08-29 12:01:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know what he does, honestly
2014-08-29 12:01:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he has this printing business
2014-08-29 12:01:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he's occasionally in his office for it
2014-08-29 12:01:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but he's not in there a lot
2014-08-29 12:01:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he doesn't seem to have a schedule
2014-08-29 12:02:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not really sure what he does for fun
2014-08-29 12:02:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I don't ever hear him talking to friends or anything
2014-08-29 12:02:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kill people 
2014-08-29 12:02:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-08-29 12:02:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe!
2014-08-29 12:02:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean, I feel like I'm not being fair
2014-08-29 12:02:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he's a really nice guy to talk to
2014-08-29 12:02:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he offered to take me to the grocery store whenever he goes
2014-08-29 12:03:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but he just seems kinda odd at the same time
2014-08-29 12:03:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's nice
2014-08-29 12:05:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I think I'm gonna shower and get ready for class
2014-08-29 12:05:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hopefully this one is enjoyable
2014-08-29 12:05:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my other ones are gonna wear me down I have a feeling
2014-08-29 12:06:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you, sugar. Have fun at North Coast... send me snaps if you get the chance!
2014-08-29 12:06:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will do!
2014-08-29 14:04:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you want to text me something, use text not hangouts 
2014-08-29 14:04:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gonna try to keep 4g off mostly
2014-08-29 14:04:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To save battery
2014-08-30 08:36:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Home!
2014-08-30 08:47:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Call me when you're awake and not busy 
2014-08-30 08:51:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-08-30 11:15:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whatcha doin?
2014-08-30 11:15:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]watching some football
2014-08-30 11:15:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]UCLA vs. UVA
2014-08-30 11:15:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what about you?
2014-08-30 11:16:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lying around
2014-08-30 11:16:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-08-30 11:16:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have fun last night?
2014-08-30 11:16:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah it was a lot of fun
2014-08-30 11:17:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Feeling a little poopy this morning, but not too bad
2014-08-30 11:17:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What'd you do?
2014-08-30 11:17:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We went to a couple bars in Lincoln Park
2014-08-30 11:18:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some dancing and quite a bit of drinking
2014-08-30 11:19:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-08-30 11:19:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you stay at Priya's?
2014-08-30 11:20:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, she lives in boys town now
2014-08-30 11:20:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But since Darcy is gone I had to get up early to come home and feed the cats
2014-08-30 11:20:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-08-30 11:22:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]North Coast was a good time as well?
2014-08-30 11:22:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was, and a little bit of a shitshow
2014-08-30 11:23:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Priya was pretty much wasted by the time we got there, and after she took her capsule she had no idea where she was or who I was for a little bit
2014-08-30 11:24:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like drunk?
2014-08-30 11:25:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, we pregamed with her friends for a couple hours before going in
2014-08-30 11:25:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh
2014-08-30 11:25:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so how does mixing MDMA and alcohol work?
2014-08-30 11:26:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If your drunk enough, I guess it gets your really fucked up
2014-08-30 11:26:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fucked up how?
2014-08-30 11:26:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like why would you do both?
2014-08-30 11:27:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fucked up to the point that you ask who's playing 6 times in a row and forget who your friends are I guess. I wouldn't choose to do it
2014-08-30 11:28:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you were weren't you?
2014-08-30 11:28:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess for me it helped with anxiousness 
2014-08-30 11:28:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah but I had had like 3 or 4 drinks max
2014-08-30 11:28:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-08-30 11:28:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Until we went out after 
2014-08-30 11:29:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She was taking shots and drinking straight whiskey
2014-08-30 11:29:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-08-30 11:29:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she recovered by the end of the night I guess?
2014-08-30 11:29:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or by the time you went out
2014-08-30 11:30:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah after the show she seemed a little more like a typical person rolling
2014-08-30 11:30:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-08-30 11:30:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's good
2014-08-30 11:30:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]anything particularly interesting about any of the bars?
2014-08-30 11:31:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean she was mostly pretty entertaining. And I got along really well with her friends that we went with.
2014-08-30 11:31:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not judging
2014-08-30 11:32:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd get fucked up all the time if I could
2014-08-30 11:32:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know I was just explaining the situation 
2014-08-30 11:35:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Max Bar was pretty neat. Small, but played dancey edm and had ridiculous lights
2014-08-30 11:35:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And like multiple little rooms
2014-08-30 11:37:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh!
2014-08-30 11:37:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They were shooting the Real World there
2014-08-30 11:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah?
2014-08-30 11:37:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't even know that was still on
2014-08-30 11:37:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which was really fucking strange to watch
2014-08-30 11:38:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you gonna be on TV?
2014-08-30 11:38:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because it was soooo staged
2014-08-30 11:38:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno
2014-08-30 11:38:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hopefully not lol
2014-08-30 11:39:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you don't have to sign waivers or anything?
2014-08-30 11:39:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe they blur people's faces out
2014-08-30 11:39:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or maybe they'll be a sloppy Katie on MTV
2014-08-30 11:39:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-08-30 11:39:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe there was a sign we didn't see going in
2014-08-30 11:39:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-08-30 11:39:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think that's all you have to do now
2014-08-30 11:40:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://voices.suntimes.com/arts-entertainment/the-daily-sizzle/its-official-filming-has-started-on-mtvs-real-world-chicago/
2014-08-30 11:40:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-08-30 11:41:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we'll have to keep an eye out once it airs
2014-08-30 11:41:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They looked so young too.
2014-08-30 11:41:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess they're probably my age
2014-08-30 11:41:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I was about to say
2014-08-30 11:41:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they are like mid twenties I thought
2014-08-30 11:42:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The last time I watched an episode was like 10 years ago, so I'm sure they looked a lot older to me then
2014-08-30 11:42:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why didn't you call me?
2014-08-30 11:42:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]today?
2014-08-30 11:42:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-08-30 11:43:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I figured you were sleeping
2014-08-30 11:43:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't really sure why you wanted me to call you either
2014-08-30 11:43:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To talk to you?
2014-08-30 11:43:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh
2014-08-30 11:43:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well why didn't you just call me?
2014-08-30 11:44:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause it was 8:30a and I figured you were sleeping
2014-08-30 11:44:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you want to talk now?
2014-08-30 11:44:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess we are talking now lol 
2014-08-30 11:45:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]everyone is 23-26 on Real World Chicago
2014-08-30 11:45:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mode of 23
2014-08-30 11:45:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like I missed my chance
2014-08-30 11:45:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Darn
2014-08-30 11:46:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]next life
2014-08-30 11:48:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want pancakesss
2014-08-30 11:48:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]go get some
2014-08-30 11:49:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to go by myself
2014-08-30 11:49:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why not?
2014-08-30 11:49:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That just sounds sad
2014-08-30 11:49:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah/
2014-08-30 11:49:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-08-30 11:50:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd rather be getting pancakes with you
2014-08-30 11:55:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you prefer me to not text you when I'm out and fucked up?
2014-08-30 11:56:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no why?
2014-08-30 11:56:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, maybe you found it annoying
2014-08-30 11:57:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You only sent me like three messages.
2014-08-30 11:58:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess there was more than that.
2014-08-30 12:02:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I felt like I was getting kind of weird vibes from you, this morning as well. But maybe that's just an artifact of texting or in my head 
2014-08-30 12:03:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would say I am, in general, not very happy
2014-08-30 12:03:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why?
2014-08-30 12:03:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I'm in Richardson, TX
2014-08-30 12:04:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, does me talking about having fun make you unhappier?
2014-08-30 12:04:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably
2014-08-30 12:05:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's understandable
2014-08-30 12:05:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry
2014-08-30 12:05:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good
2014-08-30 12:05:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm paying for a long line of misguided decisions
2014-08-30 12:06:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But those misguided decisions helped bring us together, too!
2014-08-30 12:06:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-08-30 12:07:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-08-30 12:08:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll still get to have lots of fun together this year
2014-08-30 12:08:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too
2014-08-30 12:08:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe!
2014-08-30 12:08:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not really like what you're doing
2014-08-30 12:09:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm now friends with a coke dealer and a Molly dealer
2014-08-30 12:09:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-08-30 12:09:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you do some coke last night?
2014-08-30 12:09:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can have that kind of fun when you come visit if you want
2014-08-30 12:10:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, I don't like mixing uppers like that 
2014-08-30 12:10:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's still not really the same
2014-08-30 12:10:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It makes me feel too cracked out
2014-08-30 12:10:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's all good
2014-08-30 12:10:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why is it not the same? Talk to me
2014-08-30 12:10:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've resigned the fact I've burned three years of my twenties
2014-08-30 12:11:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I should make more of an effort to hang out with Dar more
2014-08-30 12:11:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just tricky to get around
2014-08-30 12:11:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could make it happen, though
2014-08-30 12:11:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who says you have to stop doing drugs and going out in your 20s?
2014-08-30 12:12:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what
2014-08-30 12:13:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You still have plenty of years of youthfulness
2014-08-30 12:16:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I meant to say stop after your 20s
2014-08-30 12:17:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I mean it's whatever
2014-08-30 12:18:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I somehow managed to get into a social circle with a bunch of people who have a good time and travel all the time
2014-08-30 12:18:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't actually do those things
2014-08-30 12:19:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sets me up for unrealistic expectations
2014-08-30 12:19:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or reminds me that I did things wrong
2014-08-30 12:19:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why don't you go out with them more? You don't have to worry about money nearly as much 
2014-08-30 12:20:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dar?
2014-08-30 12:20:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I meant more like UChicago people
2014-08-30 12:20:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whichever social group you were referring to
2014-08-30 12:21:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that would be Chicago people primarily I suppose
2014-08-30 12:21:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Carl seems to go out and do stuff
2014-08-30 12:21:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah we're gonna meet up this coming weekend
2014-08-30 12:22:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he doesn't really do drugs, though
2014-08-30 12:22:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's alright
2014-08-30 12:24:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't discredit the times we see each other as not being genuine fun, especially before they even happen! I know the frequency isn't ideal
2014-08-30 12:25:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not saying it's not genuine fun
2014-08-30 12:25:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not really the type of fun I'm talking about here
2014-08-30 12:26:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're saying it's not the same, which I still don't quite understand
2014-08-30 12:27:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because it's not spontaneous? 
2014-08-30 12:27:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-08-30 12:27:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I've never been carefree
2014-08-30 12:27:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and just going wild
2014-08-30 12:28:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's whatever
2014-08-30 12:28:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really want to talk about it
2014-08-30 12:28:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-08-30 12:29:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't like being shut out, but I don't think I'm making you feel any better anyways so we can drop it
2014-08-30 12:29:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not shutting you out
2014-08-30 12:29:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's nothing I can do about my current situation
2014-08-30 12:29:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or the life I've led up until this point
2014-08-30 12:30:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except change your attitude, try too look at the positives
2014-08-30 12:30:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, I'll do that
2014-08-30 13:00:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you got any plans for today?
2014-08-30 13:01:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nope, I think I'm gonna take it easy. I'm feeling pretty blah right now.
2014-08-30 13:01:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Might watch some Netflix
2014-08-30 13:02:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Trying to figure out a way to get pancakes delivered to me
2014-08-30 13:02:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-08-30 13:02:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]any luck?
2014-08-30 13:03:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-08-30 13:03:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bummer
2014-08-30 13:03:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe buy frozen ones at HPP
2014-08-30 13:03:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gross
2014-08-30 13:03:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Carl is in Auburn right now
2014-08-30 13:03:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yo, don't diss on frozen pancakes 
2014-08-30 13:03:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why?
2014-08-30 13:04:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He's visiting a friend who lives in Atlanta and they decided to go to Auburn today I guess.
2014-08-30 13:05:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd like to visit auburn sometime with you
2014-08-30 13:05:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]See some big southern trees
2014-08-30 13:06:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that'd be fun.
2014-08-30 13:08:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I downgraded the OS on my phone and it's working MUCH better
2014-08-30 13:08:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's pretty goofy
2014-08-30 13:08:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's great!
2014-08-30 13:09:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What if I got strep throat?
2014-08-30 13:10:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd suck
2014-08-30 13:10:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But would be interesting!
2014-08-30 13:10:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha would it?
2014-08-30 13:11:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would support our theory of you being a carrier of a mostly benign strain that flares up when the immune system dips
2014-08-30 13:12:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you feel sick or something?
2014-08-30 13:15:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel a little nauseous  
2014-08-30 13:15:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And sore
2014-08-30 13:15:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like a hangover
2014-08-30 13:16:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah it probably is
2014-08-30 13:25:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you know when you're going to be going home for Thanksgiving?
2014-08-30 13:27:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably flying in the night of Tuesday the 25
2014-08-30 13:27:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and out?
2014-08-30 13:28:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess Sunday, unless I don't have any Monday classes
2014-08-30 13:28:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-08-30 13:28:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm trying to decide if I want to organize a couple of extra trips
2014-08-30 13:29:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the holidays actually make the amount of time between visits inconvenient
2014-08-30 13:29:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A month
2014-08-30 13:29:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah like 5 weeks more like
2014-08-30 13:30:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess a month between Halloween and Thanksgiving
2014-08-30 13:30:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you're already gonna be missing your Friday class for Halloween 
2014-08-30 13:31:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not
2014-08-30 13:31:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm leaving after it
2014-08-30 13:31:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So getting in Friday night and leaving Sunday?
2014-08-30 13:32:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]monday
2014-08-30 13:32:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I want to see you the weekend of October 4th
2014-08-30 13:32:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's when I'm in Vegas
2014-08-30 13:32:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are 37 days between September 17th and October 24th
2014-08-30 13:33:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-08-30 13:33:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think the party will be the weekend before Halloween weekend
2014-08-30 13:33:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-08-30 13:33:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the weekend of the 24th
2014-08-30 13:33:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh sorry
2014-08-30 13:34:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what about the 12th?
2014-08-30 13:34:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What about the 11?
2014-08-30 13:34:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That'd work 
2014-08-30 13:35:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I go to texas though, we have to go to my moms birthday party
2014-08-30 13:35:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-08-30 13:35:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well what would you rather do?
2014-08-30 13:35:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Might be better for you to come here if you think you can swing it
2014-08-30 13:35:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$205 roundtrip right now
2014-08-30 13:36:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's not bad
2014-08-30 13:36:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should put it on my credit card though so I can get the points!
2014-08-30 13:36:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-08-30 13:36:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should've told me to do that for my other one
2014-08-30 13:36:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was Southwest
2014-08-30 13:36:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You already booked Halloween?
2014-08-30 13:37:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I thought I told it to email you.
2014-08-30 13:37:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wanted to put it on my credit card when you were here!
2014-08-30 13:37:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we didn't get around to booking it
2014-08-30 13:37:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually have American Express points
2014-08-30 13:37:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let me see if I can get some shit.
2014-08-30 13:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope
2014-08-30 13:40:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-08-30 13:40:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well want me to book that flight then?
2014-08-30 13:40:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might try to visit you between Halloween and Thanksgiving too
2014-08-30 13:43:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I won't get the new credit card until Monday 
2014-08-30 13:43:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-08-30 13:44:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you wait until then? Or if you think the price is gonna jump we can just do it now
2014-08-30 13:44:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt it'll jump much
2014-08-30 13:44:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can wait
2014-08-30 13:44:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can't retroactively get points, right?
2014-08-30 13:44:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So Friday until Monday?
2014-08-30 13:44:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-08-30 13:44:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes you can
2014-08-30 13:44:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my effing Bioinformatics professor won't give us an actual schedule
2014-08-30 13:44:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I can't know whether or not I can skip that day
2014-08-30 13:45:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you don't know when your tests are?
2014-08-30 13:45:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]exactly
2014-08-30 13:45:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so fucking bullshit
2014-08-30 13:46:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tell her/him that you have a wedding to go to that Sunday and you need to know what time to book your flight home
2014-08-30 13:47:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you need a heads up on the exams?
2014-08-30 13:47:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Now that I'm looking at it.
2014-08-30 13:47:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We only have two exams
2014-08-30 13:47:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and one is during finals
2014-08-30 13:47:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]soo
2014-08-30 13:47:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when would midterms be
2014-08-30 13:48:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]October
2014-08-30 13:48:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you think a midterm would ever be on a Monday?
2014-08-30 13:49:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure
2014-08-30 13:49:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess Wednesday would be more fair so you could have a review day
2014-08-30 13:51:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I think I can move the Southwest to Tuesday and it won't make a difference
2014-08-30 13:51:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless you have a midte
2014-08-30 13:51:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*midterm
2014-08-30 13:51:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I can just move it back, right?
2014-08-30 13:51:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I emailed him
2014-08-30 13:52:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so hopefully he gets back to me
2014-08-30 13:52:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I already emailed him once, though
2014-08-30 13:52:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]asking for a tentative schedule for the exams
2014-08-30 13:52:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he emailed back saying to check the eLearning site
2014-08-30 13:53:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which said the final will be during it's final period
2014-08-30 13:53:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no mention of the midterm
2014-08-30 13:53:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-08-30 13:53:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh shitty teachers 
2014-08-30 13:53:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]very

2014-08-30 13:54:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He pulled the covers over his head
2014-08-30 13:55:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Such a nice kitty
2014-08-30 13:55:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's great
2014-08-30 13:55:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'd feel pretty good if I got a visit in the weekend of the 12th
2014-08-30 13:55:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and maybe one in November too
2014-08-30 13:55:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if that's not too much fory ou
2014-08-30 13:56:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't have any idea of my work schedule
2014-08-30 13:56:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Class schedule
2014-08-30 13:56:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-08-30 13:57:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we should wait until I get that to book November, but obviously I'd like that too
2014-08-30 15:00:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send me 500 snaps too
2014-08-30 15:00:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok

2014-08-30 15:05:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah
2014-08-30 15:06:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice!
2014-08-30 15:06:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm working on the money.
2014-08-30 15:06:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have to re-set up my Chase app
2014-08-30 15:06:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm ordering crab Rangoon!
2014-08-30 15:06:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I had to completely reset my phone
2014-08-30 15:06:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No rush, you can do it after the game
2014-08-30 15:12:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh shit our offense is still sick
2014-08-30 15:12:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]might be better
2014-08-30 15:14:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I'll put the game on
2014-08-30 15:14:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Get some education about Auburn football
2014-08-30 15:15:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-08-30 15:17:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where do I stream games? 
2014-08-30 15:17:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you might be able to use Watch Espn
2014-08-30 15:18:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Time Warner doesn't yet
2014-08-30 15:18:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you can use this if you can't use Watch ESPN  http://ifirstrowus.eu/watch/278876/2/watch-arkansas-vs-6-auburn-.html
2014-08-30 15:18:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Watch ESPN will be better quality, though
2014-08-30 15:21:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Our effing defense is still terrible
2014-08-30 15:23:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's  ksil91@gmail.com
2014-08-30 15:23:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry
2014-08-30 15:23:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Does it matter?
2014-08-30 15:24:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-08-30 15:24:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK
2014-08-30 15:24:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you decline that one?
2014-08-30 15:24:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-08-30 15:24:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do I have to?
2014-08-30 15:24:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure how long it stays pending
2014-08-30 15:24:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and what that means for my back account
2014-08-30 15:24:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you don't
2014-08-30 15:25:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok I'll figure out how to decline it
2014-08-30 15:25:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Watch auburn, we can figure it out later
2014-08-30 15:25:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why does the email matter?
2014-08-30 15:26:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-08-30 15:28:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause ksilliman is linked to my credit card and ksil81 my BOA stuff
2014-08-30 15:29:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what does the email tell you to do?
2014-08-30 15:30:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It takes me to the account where "Chase Quickpay is not authorized"
2014-08-30 15:30:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-08-30 15:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you can't decline it then?
2014-08-30 15:33:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, but I can try to fix it tomorrow when I get my computer from campus
2014-08-30 15:34:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-08-30 15:35:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you
2014-08-30 15:36:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love love love you
2014-08-30 15:36:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How long do you think it would take for us to reach 1000 blowjobs?
2014-08-30 15:36:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-08-30 15:37:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually thought the same thing
2014-08-30 15:37:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was wondering if we'd reach that in my life
2014-08-30 15:37:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess probably
2014-08-30 15:38:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will we count oral sex that precedes penetration?
2014-08-30 15:38:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't know
2014-08-30 15:38:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not really what I had in mind
2014-08-30 15:38:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so we definitely wouldn't reach it in that case
2014-08-30 15:38:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-08-30 15:39:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I gave you a full blow job 2 times a week, we'd reach it in 10 years
2014-08-30 15:40:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which would be a lot of head
2014-08-30 15:41:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bet if we lived together we could average 1.5 a week
2014-08-30 15:41:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha really?
2014-08-30 15:41:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely once a week
2014-08-30 15:42:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like your optimism    😉 
2014-08-30 15:42:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially if sometimes I get some fingering action afterwards like your last night here
2014-08-30 15:42:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP];)
2014-08-30 15:43:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hell yeah
2014-08-30 15:43:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love doing that
2014-08-30 15:50:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And blowing you gets me so wet anyways
2014-08-30 15:54:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know it's so sexy.
2014-08-30 15:56:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think there might be a couple of tweaks we could make still.
2014-08-30 15:56:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I'm taking too long.
2014-08-30 16:29:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tweaks we can make to my blow job technique?
2014-08-30 16:31:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. Sometimes what you're doing feels absolutely amazing and other times less so.
2014-08-30 16:31:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I just need to give you a better idea of what feels good so you can "control" it
2014-08-30 16:32:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like when you're ready to make me cum you can.
2014-08-30 16:34:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That sounds good
2014-08-30 16:35:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You do that a little bit already when you tell me what feels really good or the noises you make 
2014-08-30 19:52:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why was the game delayed?
2014-08-30 20:04:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lightning.
2014-08-30 20:04:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The Florida game is deejayed too apparently.
2014-08-30 20:14:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Still at the watch party?
2014-08-30 20:16:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah at Dar's. I just realized delayed was corrected to deejayed. That's pretty funny.
2014-08-30 20:17:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are you up to?
2014-08-30 20:19:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was sick for a bit, then ate my pad Thai and felt better, and have been watching Netflix for the past 4 hours
2014-08-30 20:19:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Watch ESPN didn't have the game
2014-08-30 20:19:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. I'm glad you're feeling better.
2014-08-30 20:20:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meh
2014-08-30 20:20:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Still not great
2014-08-30 20:20:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But better
2014-08-30 20:21:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you have fun?
2014-08-30 20:21:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah it was good.
2014-08-30 20:22:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you drink a lot last night or do you think it's the combo?
2014-08-30 20:22:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had quite a few drinks afterwards 
2014-08-30 20:23:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh alright.
2014-08-30 20:23:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And probably very poor sleep from 3-7a
2014-08-30 20:24:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Grad students have to drink more than any other demographic, right?
2014-08-30 20:25:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What other demographics? 
2014-08-30 20:25:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Any I guess.
2014-08-30 20:25:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Except alcoholics I guess.
2014-08-30 20:25:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know if that's true
2014-08-30 20:26:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's a perfect storm.
2014-08-30 20:26:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's plenty of people that go out drinking every night and have the money to afford it
2014-08-30 20:26:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like who?
2014-08-30 20:26:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Young people in the business world?
2014-08-30 20:27:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They don't go out driving every night, though.
2014-08-30 20:27:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Drinking.
2014-08-30 20:27:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They have to work in the morning.
2014-08-30 20:27:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]People in Montana seem to like to drink a lot
2014-08-30 20:27:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Grad students can work whenever.
2014-08-30 20:27:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's true.
2014-08-30 20:28:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You have very little experience with the drinking habits of people other than graduate students. 
2014-08-30 20:28:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I don't know if we can really say
2014-08-30 20:28:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK.
2014-08-30 20:28:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not enough data I guess lol
2014-08-30 20:29:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]People who work at 9:00 AM are going to get drunk during the week less than grad students.
2014-08-30 20:29:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe maybe not
2014-08-30 20:29:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's my hypothesis.
2014-08-30 20:29:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha k
2014-08-30 20:30:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the majority of grad students in my program do get to work by 9a every day
2014-08-30 20:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah?
2014-08-30 20:31:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-08-30 20:31:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool
2014-08-30 20:32:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know why I get so defensive when you comment on the work ethic of grad students 
2014-08-30 20:41:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Seems like researchers only care about undergrad drinking habits.
2014-08-30 20:43:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Average number of drinks per week is four.
2014-08-30 20:43:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.gallup.com/poll/156770/majority-drink-alcohol-averaging-four-drinks-week.aspx
2014-08-30 20:44:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So they're at least in the top 50th percentile.
2014-08-30 20:46:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd agree with that
2014-08-30 20:48:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But as for how they rank with other young adults 23-30 I bet it's near the mean
2014-08-30 20:48:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would gladly take that bet.
2014-08-30 20:51:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On my Facebook, people in that age group look like they're still going out often
2014-08-30 20:51:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Your Facebook is not even close to the general population.
2014-08-30 20:53:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-08-30 20:53:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I have no idea then 
2014-08-30 21:46:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well honey, I think I'm gonna try to sleep
2014-08-30 21:47:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!
2014-08-30 21:50:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too.
2014-08-30 22:33:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Miss you 😘
2014-08-31 08:49:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wooo 11 hours of sleep
2014-08-31 08:49:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel much better
2014-08-31 08:53:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's good. 11 hours is pretty solid.
2014-08-31 08:59:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we're finally doing Valois breakfast again!
2014-08-31 09:04:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're your plans today?
2014-08-31 09:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just move my stuff out of storage.
2014-08-31 09:07:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What about you?
2014-08-31 09:11:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno
2014-08-31 09:11:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unpack se more hopefully 
2014-08-31 09:11:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm ready for my room to not have any boxes in it 
2014-08-31 09:13:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm probably gonna leave most of my stuff in boxes.
2014-08-31 09:15:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I've debated that
2014-08-31 09:15:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'll be overall happier for the next 8 months if I don't 
2014-08-31 09:34:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wonder if you had been around yesterday if I would've felt physically better
2014-08-31 09:35:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or at least not as bad
2014-08-31 09:38:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt I would've helped with the nausea, but it might've helped keep your mind off feeling bad at times.
2014-08-31 09:38:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who knows, some lovin' can go a long way
2014-08-31 10:02:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry I was grumpy the past couple of days.
2014-08-31 10:03:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My life was just exactly how I wish it was when I was with you, and having all that gone so quickly has been bumming me out.
2014-08-31 10:04:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But you're right, I should focus on the positive.
2014-08-31 10:04:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still have an amazing girlfriend whom I love talking to and I'm getting a degree in something I know I want to do.
2014-08-31 10:08:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we're going to see each other every 2 to 3 weeks 
2014-08-31 10:08:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Disney!!!!
2014-08-31 10:09:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah!!
2014-08-31 11:20:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No need to apologize about being grumpy
2014-08-31 11:21:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want you to be able to talk to me about that stuff
2014-08-31 11:22:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know... it's one of the reasons I love you so much.
2014-08-31 11:22:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I gotta figure out a way to be more open and less negative when I'm feeling bad I guess
2014-08-31 11:23:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes you just gotta be a little mopey, I totally understand that 
2014-08-31 11:24:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I just don't want to be bringing you down with me
2014-08-31 11:31:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do really appreciate how you didn't say anything negative on Friday night and let me enjoy myself even though you were bummed
2014-08-31 11:33:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think every other boyfriend I've been with would've been a lot less selfless, and obviously it is important to me that I feel like I can have fun without worrying about you. 
2014-08-31 11:54:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I lost my belt.
2014-08-31 11:54:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When was the last time you wore it?
2014-08-31 11:54:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Before Texas.
2014-08-31 11:55:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm guessing it's in your room somewhere, but I don't really know.
2014-08-31 11:55:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I spent way too much on that belt. It was like $25 at Target.
2014-08-31 12:00:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm cleaning and unpacking now
2014-08-31 12:00:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So ill keep an eye out for it
2014-08-31 12:00:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you sure you had it in Chicago?
2014-08-31 12:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No I guess not. You thinking I left it in Pennsylvania?
2014-08-31 12:06:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have no idea. But I remember we couldn't find it before Montana and I don't necessarily remember you wearing it here
2014-08-31 12:07:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm you don't remember ever taking it off me? ;)
2014-08-31 12:08:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I do, but I'm not 100% sure that was in my bed.
2014-08-31 12:11:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah it's all good. I should manage.
2014-08-31 13:28:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also $25 isn't that bad for something that could theoretically support you(r pants) for a few years...if you didn't lose it 
2014-08-31 16:49:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I forgot Snapchat updated so it broke my saving hack :/
2014-08-31 16:51:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'll wear this dress for you in person sometime
2014-08-31 16:52:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-08-31 16:58:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I gave my dresser to Antoine.
2014-08-31 17:41:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where are you going to store your clothes?
2014-08-31 17:41:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're gonna need a dresser when we move in together anyways
2014-08-31 17:43:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There are dressers in the room I'm in.
2014-08-31 17:44:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And we can figure all that out when we get there. My dresser was pretty shitty and missing a drawer anyway.
2014-08-31 17:46:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not worth the move then lol
2014-08-31 17:46:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha exactly.
2014-08-31 17:49:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Moving my shit did get me a little excited about moving in with you. Gotta remember it's 8.5 months away!
2014-08-31 17:52:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have way too many fucking socks.
2014-08-31 17:52:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I loaded up when I didn't have a washer and dryer. I need to toss some.
2014-08-31 17:57:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wooooo!
2014-08-31 17:57:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And throw away some of your grody underwear too
2014-08-31 17:57:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm a 7th wheel now
2014-08-31 17:57:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wooo boy
2014-08-31 17:58:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha, I thought you liked my grody underwear?!
2014-08-31 17:58:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Geez why don't you get a boyfriend or something?

2014-08-31 18:10:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do really like that you wear boxer briefs though 
2014-08-31 18:12:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know why people where boxers or briefs when boxer briefs exist.
2014-08-31 18:14:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Still can't believe I lost my glove :(
2014-08-31 18:33:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We gotta get better about you losing our shit during visits haha
2014-08-31 18:34:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did I lose something of yours?
2014-08-31 18:41:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmmm I don't know where my Auburn hat is either :(((
2014-08-31 18:42:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had to have left them at your place.
2014-08-31 18:43:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Right?

2014-08-31 18:43:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you wear your hat to softball?
2014-08-31 18:43:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did.
2014-08-31 18:43:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You leave your panties all over the place too.
2014-08-31 18:44:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]YOU leave them all over the place
2014-08-31 18:44:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha noo you pretty much always fling them yourself
2014-08-31 18:44:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmmm
2014-08-31 18:44:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wherever my hat is my glove is
2014-08-31 18:45:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll scour the apt and text Gerhke about your stuff 
2014-08-31 18:45:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I can't imagine someone picked it up and didn't think to tell me
2014-08-31 18:45:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah... I mean it's an Auburn hat
2014-08-31 18:46:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe you put it in a box on accident?
2014-08-31 18:46:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know.
2014-08-31 18:46:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So weird.
2014-08-31 18:46:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's like the death knell of my youth
2014-08-31 18:58:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can you give me your HBO GO info again?
2014-08-31 19:06:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just unpacked all the boxes
2014-08-31 19:06:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless it's in the sweater one

2014-08-31 19:16:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And moved some furniture by myself

2014-08-31 20:39:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]didn't realize that wasn't clear
2014-08-31 20:42:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should file a bug report with Snapchat so they can fix that video that won't load
2014-08-31 20:42:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://support.snapchat.com/co/bug-cant-open
2014-08-31 20:44:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Found your credit card.
2014-08-31 21:09:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?????
2014-08-31 21:09:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're?
2014-08-31 21:10:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was in a random pocket in my Red Hat laptop bag
2014-08-31 21:10:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm guessing it fell off the shelf
2014-09-01 00:13:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You. Still awake?
2014-09-01 00:15:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Unfortunately.
2014-09-01 00:20:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wait 15 min
2014-09-01 00:21:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll put my phone on vibrate.
2014-09-01 00:38:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why the attitude? I was looking forward to talking to you when I got home
2014-09-01 00:58:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Phone die?
2014-09-01 01:20:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We didn't talk about my bike wreck!
2014-09-01 01:22:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have we started the no Hangouts rule?
2014-09-01 09:11:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we should have a limited/no texting rule while someone is out.

2014-09-01 10:03:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much
2014-09-01 10:03:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're my best friend
2014-09-01 10:03:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you all the time
2014-09-01 10:04:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you make my life wonderful in so many different ways
2014-09-01 10:04:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry about what I said
2014-09-01 10:04:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't trying to make you feel like I was punishing you
2014-09-01 10:05:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you make me so happy
2014-09-01 10:05:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm addicted to you a little bit
2014-09-01 10:05:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm not making you happy for 80% of our relationship right now
2014-09-01 10:06:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not you
2014-09-01 10:06:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's my brain
2014-09-01 10:06:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're not doing anything malicious
2014-09-01 10:06:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the opposite actually
2014-09-01 10:06:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you want to talk to me whenever you have a free moment
2014-09-01 10:06:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you want to share your life with me
2014-09-01 10:06:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I really do appreciate that and love that about you
2014-09-01 10:07:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe just keeping that in mind will help me out
2014-09-01 10:08:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can do a better job telling you ahead of time when messaging is gonna be slow or delayed because I'm busy
2014-09-01 10:08:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-09-01 10:08:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you shouldn't really have to do that
2014-09-01 10:08:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-01 10:08:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's kinda ridiculous on my part
2014-09-01 10:08:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I already know when you're busy anyway
2014-09-01 10:09:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I knew you were busy last night
2014-09-01 10:09:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-01 10:09:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll be better
2014-09-01 10:10:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't just pretend you're happier for me
2014-09-01 10:10:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK I won't
2014-09-01 10:10:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna try to be happier
2014-09-01 10:10:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna focus on the fact all your messages are expressions of love
2014-09-01 10:11:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'll value them for that
2014-09-01 10:11:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe not allllll my messages
2014-09-01 10:12:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-01 10:12:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like wanting to take a break?
2014-09-01 10:12:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the second time you've made me feel pretty sad
2014-09-01 10:12:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well theoretically I put that on the table because I thought it might make you feel better
2014-09-01 10:13:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm obviously glad it was rejected
2014-09-01 10:13:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you REALLY thought that'd make me feel better?
2014-09-01 10:15:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well based on what I was hearing from you. You were making me feel like I was keeping you from being happy. And I didn't really mean like an open relationship, just not talk until we see each other 
2014-09-01 10:16:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK I guess that makes it different
2014-09-01 10:17:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a stupid drunk idea
2014-09-01 10:18:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't be able to handle not talking to you every day
2014-09-01 10:22:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I wouldn't either.
2014-09-01 10:22:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry, sugar
2014-09-01 10:25:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish I could make love to you right now
2014-09-01 10:27:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too 
2014-09-01 10:28:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Snap?
2014-09-01 10:31:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol I guess I deleted you from SnapChat too
2014-09-01 10:31:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha damn you weren't messing around
2014-09-01 10:32:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You did say you were over Snapchat
2014-09-01 10:32:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which I really couldn't understand 
2014-09-01 10:33:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I don't know
2014-09-01 10:34:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now tell me how much you love me
2014-09-01 10:36:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You aight
2014-09-01 10:37:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-01 10:37:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send meeee a snap
2014-09-01 10:37:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that works
2014-09-01 10:41:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you shirtless outside?
2014-09-01 10:41:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]shirtless inside
2014-09-01 10:41:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wish you were shirtless inside me 
2014-09-01 10:42:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that got sexy fast
2014-09-01 10:42:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]16 days
2014-09-01 10:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]foot massages and me deep inside you
2014-09-01 10:46:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At the same time??!!!
2014-09-01 10:51:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All my dreams may come true
2014-09-01 10:51:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha just kidding
2014-09-01 10:51:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it'll be fun staying at a hotel
2014-09-01 10:52:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess we're going to have to eat out a lot?
2014-09-01 10:53:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I guess. Should probably try to eat cheap.
2014-09-01 10:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In trying to think of how I would massage your feet while having sex with you.
2014-09-01 10:54:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I kinda like the idea, though. Especially since it would make you feel good.
2014-09-01 10:55:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I put my legs on your shoulders while you're on top?
2014-09-01 10:55:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might be a little too goofy 
2014-09-01 10:56:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or 69 while massaging them hahaha
2014-09-01 10:57:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not necessarily on my shoulders. Like how they normally are and I could rub one foot with one hand.
2014-09-01 10:57:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We've only 69ed once, right?
2014-09-01 10:57:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think so
2014-09-01 10:57:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it can be over rated
2014-09-01 10:58:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? I'm a pretty big fan.
2014-09-01 10:58:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did like it when you made me come with your fingers while I was sucking you off 
2014-09-01 10:58:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That was super fucking sexy.
2014-09-01 10:59:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's hard to concentrate for me, either on my own enjoyment or giving you pleasure 
2014-09-01 10:59:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah. That makes sense.
2014-09-01 10:59:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we can practice it a bit. Maybe having a bigger bed will help too :)
2014-09-01 10:59:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha sounds good to me!
2014-09-01 11:00:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm weirdly excited to try the feet thing.
2014-09-01 11:00:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahahaha
2014-09-01 11:00:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh no, the secret foot fetish comes out
2014-09-01 11:00:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean I'm totally down 
2014-09-01 11:01:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nah, it's not like your feet are turning me on. But I like the idea of touching you in ways that make you feel good.
2014-09-01 11:02:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it could be kinda intimate I guess?
2014-09-01 11:02:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You are the sexiest, most wonderful man in the world
2014-09-01 11:03:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D I love you lots
2014-09-01 11:05:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We could but sandwich stuff and milk/cereal
2014-09-01 11:05:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we have a mini fridge and microwave
2014-09-01 11:05:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, that'd work.
2014-09-01 11:06:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Auburn doesn't play the Saturday you're here :((((
2014-09-01 11:07:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh wait. They play Thursday!
2014-09-01 11:07:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe we'll head to the Auburn club if we're feeling adventurous.
2014-09-01 11:08:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That'd be fun!
2014-09-01 11:08:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How do we get there...
2014-09-01 11:10:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's why I said "feeling adventurous"
2014-09-01 11:10:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-01 11:11:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude....out hotel is totally haunted

2014-09-01 11:14:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Most of the other reviews are super positive
2014-09-01 11:14:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool. I'm sure we'll be fine.
2014-09-01 11:14:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe we'll get some succubi and incubi to join us?
2014-09-01 11:16:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]D-Wade just married an old lady
2014-09-01 11:18:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude don't hate in Gabriel Union

2014-09-01 11:20:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Google "Dallas grand hotel haunted"
2014-09-01 11:20:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they broke up for a bit and D-Wade had baby?

2014-09-01 11:22:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the hotel in the video is like closed or something
2014-09-01 11:22:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What happens?
2014-09-01 11:22:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nothing
2014-09-01 11:22:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just like a derelict hotel
2014-09-01 11:23:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hope we get the 3rd floor
2014-09-01 11:24:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno if I want to hang out there alone anymore
2014-09-01 11:25:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does haunted stuff scare you?
2014-09-01 11:26:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh fuck yeah it's right next to an In&Out
2014-09-01 11:27:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think if something freaky happened I would get scared, yes
2014-09-01 11:28:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what if it's like The Shining?

2014-09-01 11:58:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]12:30 PM
2014-09-01 11:58:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I might work a couple of hours on Thursday and Friday and maybe work some on Sunday after you leave
2014-09-01 11:58:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:((
2014-09-01 11:58:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha should I not work at all?
2014-09-01 11:58:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can we have sex while you're on the clock?
2014-09-01 11:59:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm fully expecting you to be sucking my dick at least 30% of the time I'm working
2014-09-01 11:59:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha ok
2014-09-01 12:00:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're gonna be busy a long time on Thursday though
2014-09-01 12:00:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I'll skip my NLP class
2014-09-01 12:00:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if we aren't doing anything
2014-09-01 12:01:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I can probably skip that day.
2014-09-01 12:12:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is that the earlier on or later one?
2014-09-01 12:12:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]earlier
2014-09-01 12:12:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd skip my later one too, but that's the one that is all analog
2014-09-01 12:13:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe you can come up to campus with me?
2014-09-01 12:13:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the day of the game too
2014-09-01 12:13:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goes twosies on the bike?
2014-09-01 12:13:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so maybe we could get a Lyft or something to Irving?
2014-09-01 12:13:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahano
2014-09-01 12:13:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]take the bus
2014-09-01 12:13:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's actually a reasonable bus route from the hotel to campus
2014-09-01 12:14:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]takes like 40 minutes
2014-09-01 12:14:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How much would it cost to rent a car for a day?
2014-09-01 12:14:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good questoin
2014-09-01 12:17:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like $40
2014-09-01 12:20:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm, could be totally worth it to go to the watch party. We could do something fun Friday morning too before your class
2014-09-01 12:21:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also I chose the hotel because it was on a bus route #holla #resourceful
2014-09-01 12:21:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-01 12:22:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, we can do that then
2014-09-01 12:22:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what 24 hours do you think we should have it for?
2014-09-01 12:22:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I kindaaaaa wish you were giving me head right now.
2014-09-01 12:22:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got the thought in my brain, haha.
2014-09-01 12:26:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmmm
2014-09-01 12:26:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where can we pick it up from?
2014-09-01 12:27:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure.
2014-09-01 12:29:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$23 per day
2014-09-01 12:29:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on hotwire
2014-09-01 12:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well
2014-09-01 12:29:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woah
2014-09-01 12:29:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$35.89 total
2014-09-01 12:29:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know what that means
2014-09-01 12:30:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even that isn't too bad
2014-09-01 12:30:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's at the airport, though
2014-09-01 12:32:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There's one that's a couple of miles away
2014-09-01 12:32:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for $43.38 total
2014-09-01 12:32:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so only $8 more
2014-09-01 12:33:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should let me use your car
2014-09-01 12:33:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-01 12:34:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we could do Thursday afternoon to Saturday afternoon? 
2014-09-01 12:34:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm OK
2014-09-01 12:34:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like this trip is getting expensive for me
2014-09-01 12:36:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I would've been better off getting my own place
2014-09-01 12:36:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-09-01 12:37:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think two days would be best I guess?
2014-09-01 12:37:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can do just one day
2014-09-01 12:38:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's cool if you think two would be better
2014-09-01 12:38:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I just sort've became aware of the money I was spending
2014-09-01 12:38:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]between the hotel and food and renting a car for two days that's like $400 probably
2014-09-01 12:38:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm gonna try to get that flight in October
2014-09-01 12:38:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is another $200
2014-09-01 12:39:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then if I get that flight in November, another $200
2014-09-01 12:39:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess I'll be working
2014-09-01 12:39:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so all that will be covered
2014-09-01 12:40:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'll pay for a couple flights after I get paid
2014-09-01 12:41:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since I'm not visiting you any more this fall
2014-09-01 12:42:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I'll pay for the other October one with the credit card
2014-09-01 12:42:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright. Yeah, that'll work.
2014-09-01 12:42:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Then I'll get the November one.
2014-09-01 12:43:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you think having the rental for two days would be better, though?
2014-09-01 12:43:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we could go out on Friday night easier.
2014-09-01 12:45:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Call me again.
2014-09-01 12:45:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I tried calling you while you were calling me I think.
2014-09-01 13:39:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Send me a Snap of yo titays!
2014-09-01 13:51:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aw I didn't see this, I've already left 
2014-09-01 13:52:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I can send you a sneaky office titty shot
2014-09-01 13:52:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oooh I like the sound of that    😃 
2014-09-01 13:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we definitely have to sex it up at UChicago or The Field Museum before you finish
2014-09-01 13:57:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you done that before?
2014-09-01 13:57:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have not. You?
2014-09-01 13:59:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha no way
2014-09-01 13:59:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had sex in the old Auburn Natural History Museum.
2014-09-01 14:00:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'd definitely be down to put it on the list
2014-09-01 15:27:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just saw your previous post 
2014-09-01 15:27:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty impressive
2014-09-01 15:37:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]send me a test snap
2014-09-01 15:38:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I downgraded the app to an older version
2014-09-01 15:40:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're such a dork lol
2014-09-01 15:41:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know you love it
2014-09-01 15:42:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybeee
2014-09-01 15:42:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're so sexy... I can't even handle it
2014-09-01 15:43:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't send me enough sexy snaps
2014-09-01 15:44:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What happened to post shower ones where I can totally see your dick outline under the towel??
2014-09-01 15:44:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha are those the kinds of snaps you want?
2014-09-01 15:44:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is a sexy snap for you?
2014-09-01 15:44:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like it's obvious for me
2014-09-01 15:45:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ass 'n' titties
2014-09-01 15:45:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the ass is woefully underrepresented, by the way
2014-09-01 15:45:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you were all about the ass snaps early on
2014-09-01 15:45:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's all I am to you???  😭😭😭😭
2014-09-01 15:45:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm just saying those are obviously sexy snaps
2014-09-01 15:46:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ass snaps can be more difficult to do spontaneously
2014-09-01 15:46:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anytime you're shirtless it's sexy
2014-09-01 15:46:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm, maybe one of you just in boxer briefs 
2014-09-01 15:46:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or with just your jeans on!!
2014-09-01 15:47:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or your dick
2014-09-01 15:47:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-01 15:47:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll try to work on getting you those
2014-09-01 15:47:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like keeping you titillated.
2014-09-01 15:48:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Were those in any order of preference?
2014-09-01 15:48:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not really 
2014-09-01 15:49:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't send me a dick pic when I'm out though
2014-09-01 15:49:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or give me a good heads up 
2014-09-01 15:49:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Otherwise I can't appreciate it
2014-09-01 15:49:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-09-01 15:49:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is there something in particular I should be going for in a dick pic?
2014-09-01 15:49:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it feels kinda goofy to me
2014-09-01 15:50:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess it's not really different than an ass or titties pic
2014-09-01 15:50:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except I guess guys like looking at ass and titties
2014-09-01 15:51:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, maybe don't send a pic when it's kinda flaccid 
2014-09-01 15:51:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I figured that much out!
2014-09-01 15:52:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like your penis, I don't think I'd be turned on by a picture of a random penis. Unless it looked a lit like your I guess
2014-09-01 15:52:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*a lot like yours
2014-09-01 15:53:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty interesting
2014-09-01 15:53:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder how well you'd be able to pick out my penis in a crowd
2014-09-01 15:53:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I do like that you seem to legitimately be into my dick
2014-09-01 15:53:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like when you kiss it after we've had sex
2014-09-01 15:54:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah? I'm glad you like that
2014-09-01 15:54:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your dick has brought me nothing but pleasure 
2014-09-01 15:55:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except those rare times when we have toooo much sex, but that's 50% my fault too lol
2014-09-01 15:57:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you still cum when you're sore?
2014-09-01 15:57:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or does it pretty much ruin it?
2014-09-01 15:58:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I can still cum. I just have to be really lubricated and start slow. It's really only the beginning that ever hurts when I'm sore
2014-09-01 15:59:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We didn't really have an issue at all this last visit though!
2014-09-01 15:59:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Despite doing a terrible job of keeping to the quota 
2014-09-01 15:59:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well there were relatively long periods of time of no sex in that
2014-09-01 15:59:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there
2014-09-01 15:59:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*
2014-09-01 15:59:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for us
2014-09-01 16:00:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we had like a 36 hour stretch in there
2014-09-01 16:00:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A miracle
2014-09-01 16:00:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and travelling days are pretty long
2014-09-01 16:00:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-01 16:00:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does it motivate you to have sex when we haven't had it for "a long time"
2014-09-01 16:00:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I kinda get that vibe
2014-09-01 16:01:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know
2014-09-01 16:01:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Honestly we've never not had it for "a long time" 
2014-09-01 16:01:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just want to have sex with you when I'm turned on haha
2014-09-01 16:01:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except our whole relationship
2014-09-01 16:02:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well yeah
2014-09-01 16:02:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-01 16:02:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not had sex for a long time in each other's presence
2014-09-01 16:02:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I guess the only reason I mention that is because I feel like the times I've mentioned it
2014-09-01 16:02:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've initiated sex pretty soon after
2014-09-01 16:03:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess it could be just coincidence
2014-09-01 16:03:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I mention it when we finally have the chance
2014-09-01 16:03:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or we're talking about sex, which obviously leads to thinking about sex
2014-09-01 16:03:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]true
2014-09-01 16:05:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I've once initiated sex  with you for any reason than wanting you inside of me. I don't conceptually like the idea of being 'guilted' into doing stuff like that, including guilting myself 
2014-09-01 16:06:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, that's not what I was implying
2014-09-01 16:06:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking of it more as a competitive angle
2014-09-01 16:06:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-01 16:06:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you don't seem to be doing that!
2014-09-01 16:07:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]36 hours is definitely not guilt territory
2014-09-01 16:08:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe one day when I feel like 7 in 24 hr is physically possible for both of us I'll push a little for it.
2014-09-01 16:08:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which may be a little competitive haha
2014-09-01 16:08:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-09-01 16:08:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know man
2014-09-01 16:08:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like seven might be out of reach
2014-09-01 16:09:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think our best chance was this last time
2014-09-01 16:09:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Psh
2014-09-01 16:11:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm hungry 
2014-09-01 16:11:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too!
2014-09-01 16:11:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't want to do anything because I'm tired and sore
2014-09-01 16:11:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my hip hurts too it turns out
2014-09-01 16:11:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's so weird how I don't bruise
2014-09-01 16:13:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Take some Advil man
2014-09-01 16:13:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I've thought about it

2014-09-01 19:08:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wareagle91
2014-09-01 19:08:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Time Warner

2014-09-01 19:18:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm, not sure what you're cheering for?
2014-09-01 19:18:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe you're ahead.
2014-09-01 19:18:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Looks like Louisville is about to score over here.
2014-09-01 19:19:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just for getting the stream
2014-09-01 19:19:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oooh
2014-09-01 19:20:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😞 
2014-09-01 19:25:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hate screen passes so much
2014-09-01 19:25:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Auburn actually had one work on Saturday and I said something about it to my brother, haha
2014-09-01 19:36:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WTF
2014-09-01 19:36:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Messy shit
2014-09-01 19:36:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did they just take a time out?
2014-09-01 19:37:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-01 19:37:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]alright, just wanted to check if we were in sync
2014-09-01 19:37:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We have a young team
2014-09-01 19:37:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Give em a break
2014-09-01 19:37:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-01 19:37:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my WTF was more directed at the playcall
2014-09-01 19:38:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a draw on 3rd and 9 on the opponent's side of the field seems unnecessarily conservative
2014-09-01 19:38:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess they were planning on going for it on 4th
2014-09-01 19:38:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it makes more sense in that case
2014-09-01 19:45:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Texting about football is hardddd
2014-09-01 19:45:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But wooooooooo
2014-09-01 19:45:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-01 19:45:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't have to worry about it
2014-09-01 19:49:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Woo!
2014-09-01 19:49:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was a hard hit
2014-09-01 19:50:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gotta get a TD now
2014-09-01 19:50:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dafuq
2014-09-01 19:50:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck what a joke
2014-09-01 19:51:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looked like a fumble
2014-09-01 19:51:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bummer
2014-09-01 19:52:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least it was blown dead
2014-09-01 19:53:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but wow, that was a colossal fuck up
2014-09-01 19:53:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-09-01 19:53:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Damn
2014-09-01 20:11:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Screen passes, man!
2014-09-01 20:12:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So much risk for so little reward
2014-09-01 20:12:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I see what you mean
2014-09-01 20:12:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd love to do some risk analysis on screen passes
2014-09-01 20:12:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone mustve done that
2014-09-01 20:12:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt it
2014-09-01 20:12:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least not publicly
2014-09-01 20:13:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's a lot of room for advanced statistics/machine learning in football
2014-09-01 20:13:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and screen passes aren't recorded in play-by-play descriptions
2014-09-01 20:13:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you'd actually have to watch a bunch of games
2014-09-01 20:13:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it'd be pretty interesting
2014-09-01 20:17:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]boo hiss
2014-09-01 20:17:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sounds like your dream come true
2014-09-01 20:19:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-09-01 20:27:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Machine learning for football
2014-09-01 20:27:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, definitely
2014-09-01 21:16:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made sims of us
2014-09-01 21:16:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Theyre falling in love
2014-09-01 21:17:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah? How much did you intervene?
2014-09-01 21:17:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just had one ring on the door of the other
2014-09-01 21:18:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Oh, we have so much in common! I'd love to get to know you better."
2014-09-01 21:18:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How does the compatibility work?
2014-09-01 21:19:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They both like science and the outdoors and are family oriented
2014-09-01 21:20:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-09-01 21:20:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you introduce conflict?
2014-09-01 21:20:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah
2014-09-01 21:20:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I couldve made you be rude
2014-09-01 21:20:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you're controlling both of us?
2014-09-01 21:20:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But instead you wanted to "get to know me"
2014-09-01 21:21:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only one at a time
2014-09-01 21:21:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Until they move in together
2014-09-01 21:21:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't played a Sims game in forever
2014-09-01 21:21:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you switch back and forth?
2014-09-01 21:21:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or what?
2014-09-01 21:21:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Its a pain to switch kinda
2014-09-01 21:22:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yeah, i got both of our careers set and stuff
2014-09-01 21:22:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what am I?
2014-09-01 21:24:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Science career, but you're gonna be a hacker on the side

2014-09-01 21:27:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just in general I guess
2014-09-01 21:27:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that seems like a lot of people in a News Feed
2014-09-01 21:30:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar's_number

2014-09-01 22:19:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]   When losing a friend, Brooding Sims' social need will hit rock bottom and a want will appear to brood for 3 hours.
2014-09-01 22:19:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]poor Sim
2014-09-01 22:19:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Brooding Sims can "Consider the Hollowness of Life" and "Contemplate the Meaning of Meaning" as self interactions. These will slowly raise the Sim's social bar."
2014-09-01 22:20:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Brooding Sims can write Poetry genre without needing   Writing   skill level 7."
2014-09-01 22:20:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely brooding next time.
2014-09-01 22:20:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol

2014-09-01 22:27:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder how much research is incorporated into these traits and stats
2014-09-01 22:27:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or if there is someone out there just doing gut instinct stuff
2014-09-01 22:53:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://sims.wikia.com/wiki/Trait_(The_Sims_3)#List_of_traits
2014-09-01 23:26:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I forgot to tell you that my mother commented on the "now friend with Michael A. Alcorn" thing
2014-09-01 23:27:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like said something to you about it?
2014-09-01 23:27:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-09-01 23:28:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Must be visible on your timeline I guess?
2014-09-01 23:28:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah i guess so
2014-09-01 23:28:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What'd she say?
2014-09-01 23:29:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She said "Oh, I saw on facebook that you and Michael became friends and thought 'That's bizarre! They;ve been much more than friends for a while, how did they just find each other on Facebook.' chuckle chuckle"
2014-09-01 23:30:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I told her there had just been something weird with our privacy settings so we reset it
2014-09-01 23:30:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't want to get into our stupid fight
2014-09-01 23:30:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice cover.
2014-09-01 23:31:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]just more evidence that we never should've gone FBO
2014-09-01 23:31:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You were quite efficient at removing me from all your social media it seems.
2014-09-01 23:31:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha
2014-09-01 23:32:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]YOU WANTED THIS!!!
2014-09-01 23:32:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You missed G+ and Twitter
2014-09-01 23:32:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]exactly what drunk vindictive Katie was thinking
2014-09-01 23:33:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]damn
2014-09-01 23:33:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]let's not fight anymore, k?
2014-09-01 23:33:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK.
2014-09-01 23:34:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm starting to realize you have a lot of potential for harm haha
2014-09-01 23:34:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-09-01 23:35:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like the potential to be mean.
2014-09-01 23:35:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh
2014-09-01 23:36:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty good at being mean, but I think I have it under control judging by how I've handled our fights.
2014-09-01 23:37:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know if I've ever been in a position where I've been mean in that way. At least not since high school
2014-09-01 23:37:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'm not very happy with discovering that's still there
2014-09-01 23:38:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's pretty interesting. Did shit just not come up with your boyfriends?
2014-09-01 23:40:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no, I guess I didn't feel threatened very much? Or that a relationship I really really careed about was being threatened
2014-09-01 23:41:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess shit didn't really come up with Cam until after we broke up, but that's more a reflection of the staleness and lack of passion than stability
2014-09-01 23:42:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How many "boyfriends" did you have in college? Or is that hard to pin down?
2014-09-01 23:42:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]2 serious ones, and I guess 2 less serious ones
2014-09-01 23:43:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and Reuel might count as in between, but we started hanging out right after I graduated
2014-09-01 23:46:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-09-01 23:48:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well, that's a lovely note to end on haha
2014-09-01 23:48:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sorry i can be a bitch
2014-09-01 23:50:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all good.
2014-09-01 23:50:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're not a bitch.
2014-09-01 23:51:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]At least we'll go out in a blaze of glory if it comes to that haha
2014-09-01 23:51:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]if we go out over texting, Imma be real pissed
2014-09-01 23:52:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah. It'd be more like "long distance", though I guess.
2014-09-01 23:53:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Texting issues are just a symptom
2014-09-01 23:53:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]let's not talk about breaking up right now
2014-09-01 23:53:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to go to sleep
2014-09-01 23:54:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK goodnight.
2014-09-01 23:55:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you and I'm going to marry you and we're going to learn together how to not be mean when we're unhappy
2014-09-01 23:56:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds good :)
2014-09-02 09:43:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh I had such a bad stream
2014-09-02 09:43:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We got I a huge fight
2014-09-02 09:43:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:(((
2014-09-02 09:44:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I went to therapy about it
2014-09-02 09:44:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And kept waking up for the informative part 
2014-09-02 09:45:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like the part that would help?
2014-09-02 09:46:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's pretty intense that you went to therapy from a fight of ours in a dream!
2014-09-02 09:48:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry I put those thoughts in your head
2014-09-02 09:50:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah it was very metaphor laden therapy 
2014-09-02 09:51:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I kept missing  the punchline
2014-09-02 09:51:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's ok
2014-09-02 09:51:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not your fault 
2014-09-02 09:57:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]look at my snappp
2014-09-02 10:09:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Awww
2014-09-02 10:10:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know we're ok
2014-09-02 10:10:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know. Just wanted to send you a loving snap to make you feel better anyway.
2014-09-02 10:12:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:D
2014-09-02 14:46:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm gonna take a lyft from the airport on the Wed I get in, correct?
2014-09-02 14:46:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause that's cheaper than a shuttle?
2014-09-02 14:50:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Assuming my calculation is correct.
2014-09-02 14:55:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll just double check the price of a shuttle but you're probably right 
2014-09-02 14:59:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A moving trailer is like $110... so significantly cheaper than a truck.
2014-09-02 15:02:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got some significant CNS and muscle atrophy going on right now.
2014-09-02 15:03:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had to go a little alpha male at one point haha
2014-09-02 15:20:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]During the move?
2014-09-02 15:20:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]At the gym
2014-09-02 15:21:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I called University Village an hour ago about my cancelled application and they said they'd email me in 15 minutes.
2014-09-02 15:22:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What a joke
2014-09-02 15:22:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh looks like she sent it. Gmail is kinda delayed with university email accounts for some reason.
2014-09-02 15:23:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tried to take the metra from the loop
2014-09-02 15:23:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a mild disaster
2014-09-02 15:23:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. What happened?
2014-09-02 15:24:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't know it was underground 
2014-09-02 15:24:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And google maps did a terrible job of illustrating that
2014-09-02 15:24:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You were on the L then?
2014-09-02 15:24:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, the metra. 
2014-09-02 15:25:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]From Millennium station
2014-09-02 15:25:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]From Randolph?
2014-09-02 15:25:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-09-02 15:25:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Where were you trying to go?
2014-09-02 15:26:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just running around millenium park very confused. "I'm standing on top of it what the fuck?"
2014-09-02 15:26:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm coming back to hyde park from a doctors appt
2014-09-02 15:26:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oooh finding it was the issue.
2014-09-02 15:26:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-02 15:26:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, that station is definitely not obvious from street level.
2014-09-02 15:27:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And there were zero signs 
2014-09-02 15:27:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I think I remember looking for that station at one point too.
2014-09-02 15:27:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you healthy?
2014-09-02 15:28:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was for my ADHD meds
2014-09-02 15:28:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I didn't tell you I had a prescription?
2014-09-02 15:29:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No I don't think so. I saw something about ADHD on that form I printed out for you, but I was trying to respect your privacy.
2014-09-02 15:30:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How very noble haha
2014-09-02 15:31:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've been taking it about 3-4 times a week since freshman year, depending on what I'm doing. I guess I feel a little embarrassed about it.
2014-09-02 15:32:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you start taking them your freshman year?
2014-09-02 15:33:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-02 15:33:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How did you get diagnosed that late?
2014-09-02 15:35:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When I was a kid teachers told my mom multiple times to get me tested because of "discipline issues" but she didn't believe in medicating kids just because they're hyper. And I got good grades
2014-09-02 15:37:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I just went to a doctor in college and told them I had problems concentrating in lectures and keeping up with reading so he have me a prescription 
2014-09-02 15:37:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was relatively easy actually
2014-09-02 15:37:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-09-02 15:37:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have so many questions, lol.
2014-09-02 15:38:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe not so many. But ones of deep interest.
2014-09-02 15:38:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Zane has ADHD, but I don't think he was diagnoses until I was in grad school.
2014-09-02 15:42:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Does he take medicine for it?
2014-09-02 15:43:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know he did, but I don't know if he still does.
2014-09-02 15:46:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I guess I can answer your questions later if you want haha
2014-09-02 15:46:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK. It's nothing really crazy. Just about your experience.
2014-09-02 15:48:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just reminded of how our "self" is completely nebulous and largely influenced by the chemicals floating around in our brains at any given moment.
2014-09-02 15:48:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What does it really mean to love a person?
2014-09-02 15:50:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oooh you could think of it probabilistically. If your personality is a continuous distribution of personalities, maybe love is enjoying 95% of those personalities?
2014-09-02 15:50:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]TG topic #2 for you.
2014-09-02 15:51:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or the topic could be like modeling relationships. And one component could be the Markov model of sex and the other one the definition of love from a probabilistic perspective.
2014-09-02 16:10:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So my algorithms professor is going to post homework online, which might allow for a couple extra days on visits.
2014-09-02 16:18:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But do most people have continuous distributions of moods/personalities?
2014-09-02 16:18:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely. Some distributions are probably tighter than others, though.
2014-09-02 16:20:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm ok 
2014-09-02 16:22:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think "love" would have to involve more than just personality compatibility
2014-09-02 16:23:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like physical stuff?
2014-09-02 16:23:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because otherwise what's the difference between best friends and lovers?
2014-09-02 16:24:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish they had more concrete data out on how smell and pheromones are linked to attraction in humans
2014-09-02 16:25:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha you're convinced our relationship is based entirely on pheromones aren't you?
2014-09-02 16:25:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Noooooo obviously not, we are in a long distance relationship after all
2014-09-02 16:26:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it might have helped us become attracted to each other so quickly 
2014-09-02 16:26:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That would be interesting.
2014-09-02 16:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It'd be interesting to see how people responded to other people's pheromones too.
2014-09-02 16:30:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like are people more likely to cheat with someone with similar pheromones to their significant other or different?
2014-09-02 16:30:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know if that's a reasonable hypothesis
2014-09-02 16:31:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like pheromones would be tied to someone with genetic traits that are desirable to the "smeller", not linked to novelty
2014-09-02 16:36:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wouldn't that be a good hypothesis to test then?
2014-09-02 16:38:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're saying they would prefer specific pheromones rather than a diversity of pheromones.
2014-09-02 16:42:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-02 16:42:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it would still be interesting to test, but also totally impossible
2014-09-02 16:43:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol why? Why couldn't novelty be attractive?
2014-09-02 16:44:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If the person is cheating, why would pheromones associated with that person be inherently attractive?
2014-09-02 16:44:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh I don't type fast enough to have these discussions with you over text lol
2014-09-02 16:46:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm trying to get some work done, we can continue this later my love
2014-09-02 16:46:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aight
2014-09-02 17:05:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can you decline that QuickPay when you get the chance?
2014-09-02 17:23:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhh yeah
2014-09-02 17:23:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-09-02 17:38:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Declined
2014-09-02 17:38:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What a mess
2014-09-02 17:45:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks, sugar.
2014-09-02 19:10:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/106724959584540011145/albums/5627032877708273313/5627033041233361010?pid=5627033041233361010&oid=106724959584540011145
2014-09-02 19:13:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha who made that? That's awesome
2014-09-02 19:17:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me circa 2008.
2014-09-02 19:23:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-09-02 19:24:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think 20 year old you and I would've gotten along
2014-09-02 19:28:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha probably. I'm not too different just older and everything that goes with that.
2014-09-02 19:49:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Made some dope salmon for dinner. What're you up to?
2014-09-02 19:52:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just had some frozen dinner
2014-09-02 19:52:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-02 19:55:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What was it?
2014-09-02 19:55:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]uhh some like chicken alfredo shit
2014-09-02 19:55:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that you make in a pan
2014-09-02 19:58:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to?
2014-09-02 19:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Watching parks and rec with Darcy
2014-09-02 19:59:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-09-02 20:02:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol this football player, Wes Welker
2014-09-02 20:03:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]went to the Kentucky Derby and ended up getting overpaid on a bet and was like walking around handing out 100s to people
2014-09-02 20:03:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is funny in itself
2014-09-02 20:03:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but he got suspended today for amphetamines
2014-09-02 20:03:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and a source is saying he had taken Molly at the Derby and that it was cut with amphetamines
2014-09-02 20:04:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That is a fucking funny story
2014-09-02 20:05:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hope that's exactly the kind of thing I'd do if I was a pro athlete
2014-09-02 20:06:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How long is he suspended for?
2014-09-02 20:06:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]four games
2014-09-02 20:06:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is pretty ridiculous
2014-09-02 20:06:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the NFL's drug policies are completely ridiculous
2014-09-02 20:07:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a Browns receiver was suspended for the entire season because he tested positive for weed a few times
2014-09-02 20:11:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Amphetamines makes a little more sense I guess

2014-09-02 23:04:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-02 23:04:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. Sucks that it was ruined for me in high school.
2014-09-02 23:06:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-09-02 23:06:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe there are flag teams for adults or somethig?
2014-09-02 23:07:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe. Wouldn't even be close to the same thing.
2014-09-02 23:07:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know
2014-09-02 23:07:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Should I buy Christmas presents for all your family members?
2014-09-02 23:08:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah.
2014-09-02 23:08:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never spent Christmas with someone elses family
2014-09-02 23:08:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I totally should
2014-09-02 23:08:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha OK
2014-09-02 23:09:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like Disney and Christmas is the kiss of death for my relationships lol
2014-09-02 23:09:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]n of 2?
2014-09-02 23:09:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But correlation is probably not causation in this instance.
2014-09-02 23:09:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]3
2014-09-02 23:09:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Three points are a trend yo
2014-09-02 23:10:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well if you take every girl you date to Disney Christmas, obviously all but one will be a failure
2014-09-02 23:12:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I know, but I think a Disney trip was always within the last year of each relationship.
2014-09-02 23:13:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]correlation at best
2014-09-02 23:13:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]unless it was like soon after
2014-09-02 23:14:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]did your previous girlfriends buy presents for evryone?
2014-09-02 23:14:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm feeling a bit of pressure from ghosts of girlfriends past
2014-09-02 23:14:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think Hannah and I did joint presents.
2014-09-02 23:14:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Kelly definitely did.
2014-09-02 23:15:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Autumn probably got something for my parents at the least.
2014-09-02 23:17:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't even met most of them
2014-09-02 23:17:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what if they hate me
2014-09-02 23:18:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just bring up the drugs.
2014-09-02 23:18:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😯 
2014-09-02 23:20:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think that joke worked.
2014-09-02 23:21:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yours or mine?
2014-09-02 23:21:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mine
2014-09-02 23:21:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or maybe it did
2014-09-02 23:22:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it didn't make me feel less worried about making a good impression
2014-09-02 23:22:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was saying "bring up the drugs" sarcastically
2014-09-02 23:22:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like if they hate you, bring up the drugs and they'll love you
2014-09-02 23:23:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I see
2014-09-02 23:25:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, if we do actually spend the rest of our lives together
2014-09-02 23:25:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]then 1st impressions are really important!
2014-09-02 23:25:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, well you already met my parents
2014-09-02 23:25:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]everything else should be gravy
2014-09-02 23:26:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dylan's kinda goofy
2014-09-02 23:26:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you and Noelle will be best buds
2014-09-02 23:26:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it'll be interesting to see how becoming a grown up Zane interacts with you
2014-09-02 23:28:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but they haven't seen us together
2014-09-02 23:28:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunnoooooooo
2014-09-02 23:29:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]true
2014-09-02 23:29:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe they'll think you're a bad influence
2014-09-02 23:29:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]really???
2014-09-02 23:29:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]am I?
2014-09-02 23:29:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know???
2014-09-02 23:29:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you??
2014-09-02 23:30:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]are you mocking me?
2014-09-02 23:31:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe
2014-09-02 23:31:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know how much of an influence you've had on me at this point
2014-09-02 23:31:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]other than just being my girlfriend and making me happy
2014-09-02 23:32:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you're influencing me to move to Chicago
2014-09-02 23:32:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that hasn't happened yet
2014-09-02 23:32:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you're a neutral influence at this point
2014-09-02 23:33:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that could be a bad influence or a good influence depending on how things turn out
2014-09-02 23:36:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it confusing to Charlotte that Uncle Michael changes girlfriends?
2014-09-02 23:36:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what if she like Hannah more than me?
2014-09-02 23:37:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well she probably doesn't remember Hannah because she was little.
2014-09-02 23:39:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's been a little over a year?
2014-09-02 23:40:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm yeah I guess you're right. So Charlotte would've been 4 the last time she saw her.
2014-09-02 23:40:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking Christmas 2012, but it would've been my bro's wedding in September 2013
2014-09-02 23:40:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I guess not even a year.
2014-09-02 23:41:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha man crazy how different things are.
2014-09-02 23:42:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like that was a completely different life.
2014-09-02 23:48:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you sure you're happier in this one?
2014-09-02 23:49:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, for sure.
2014-09-02 23:49:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And it's a different kind of happy too I guess.
2014-09-02 23:50:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how so?
2014-09-02 23:50:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just appreciate everything more.
2014-09-02 23:52:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hmm
2014-09-02 23:54:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you happier than you were a year ago?
2014-09-02 23:55:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]absolutely!
2014-09-02 23:56:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was off and on in a weird bad place then
2014-09-02 23:56:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah?
2014-09-02 23:59:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was being very go with the flow, acting without thinking on consequences, and I hated it half the time
2014-09-03 00:02:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was in a couple "casual" relationships in a row that were very not fulfilling too
2014-09-03 00:05:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe you're on to something with the pheromone hypothesis haha
2014-09-03 00:08:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what does that have to do with this?
2014-09-03 00:09:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I connect with you in some many different ways that I haven't with previous boyfriends. 
2014-09-03 00:10:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was a joke about why they weren't fulfilling.
2014-09-03 00:11:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh
2014-09-03 00:12:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]talking about exs can be kind of a drag lol
2014-09-03 00:12:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah.
2014-09-03 00:13:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you think pushed you to act that way?
2014-09-03 00:13:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Was it that shit that happened with your ex?
2014-09-03 00:13:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-09-03 00:14:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]a little bit of "one last hoorah before I go to the real world" maybe
2014-09-03 00:15:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. That's something that I probably should have done.
2014-09-03 00:15:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I felt like I had wasted a lot of emotional energy on someone, and that it might be nice to not feel as much for a while
2014-09-03 00:15:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well fuck
2014-09-03 00:15:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why don't you do it now
2014-09-03 00:15:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do what?
2014-09-03 00:16:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fuck around for a few months?
2014-09-03 00:16:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]if you're going to be regretting it
2014-09-03 00:16:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*regretting not doing it
2014-09-03 00:17:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I already missed my window.
2014-09-03 00:18:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I ever really had the right combination of friends, funds, and free time to do what you did anyway.
2014-09-03 00:20:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well, I don't know what to tell you
2014-09-03 00:21:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't asking for you to tell me anything.
2014-09-03 00:21:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*say to you
2014-09-03 00:22:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know my biggest fear about this relationship is that you'll realize it was a rebound someday and lose interest.
2014-09-03 00:23:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or I guess feel like you want to experience the single life
2014-09-03 00:23:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well it's definitely not a rebound.
2014-09-03 00:23:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've already told you that.
2014-09-03 00:24:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I can't imagine I'd ever think the single life is better than what I have with you.
2014-09-03 00:25:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm mostly curious about how I'd handle casual sex.
2014-09-03 00:25:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How I'd adapt to that.
2014-09-03 00:25:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And how such an experience would influence how I approach relationships.
2014-09-03 00:26:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you must get hit on by women sometimes?
2014-09-03 00:27:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so m
2014-09-03 00:27:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why does that matter?
2014-09-03 00:28:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]just wondering if you've passed up opportunities
2014-09-03 00:28:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In my brief stints of being single?
2014-09-03 00:29:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or now. you're a pretty attractive guy, but I guess you currently don't go out to places where people are usually looking.
2014-09-03 00:29:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do not.
2014-09-03 00:30:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't really understand where you're going with this.
2014-09-03 00:30:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to be holding you back from an experience
2014-09-03 00:31:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So you're saying I should fuck random girls?
2014-09-03 00:31:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you want to?
2014-09-03 00:32:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No?
2014-09-03 00:33:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why not? Because you're afraid it would hurt me?
2014-09-03 00:34:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or because the concept doesn't appeal to you?
2014-09-03 00:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because I'm happy having sex with you?
2014-09-03 00:34:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why don't you want to fuck random dudes? Or am I holding you back from that?
2014-09-03 00:36:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because no one would make me feel even half as good as you.
2014-09-03 00:37:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I know that for a fact from experience. I enjoy sex way more with someone I have an emotional connection with 
2014-09-03 00:37:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Right.
2014-09-03 00:38:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]right what?
2014-09-03 00:39:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just that you know that for a fact.
2014-09-03 00:39:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you don't know that for a fact. You just have strong reasons to suspect
2014-09-03 00:40:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe sleeping with a random girl would be really exciting for you.
2014-09-03 00:40:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe!
2014-09-03 00:44:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I wasn't really trying to imply that's something I want to do now. I am curious how my life might've turned out differently if I had had the stereotypical middle class white person summer of decadence, but like I said, the opportunity never really arose.
2014-09-03 00:45:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Way to make my life experiences sound so cliche lol 
2014-09-03 00:45:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean, that one is kinda cliché.
2014-09-03 00:46:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That doesn't mean it's not valuable.
2014-09-03 00:46:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, it was mostly a joke
2014-09-03 00:46:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For the people who experience it in particular.
2014-09-03 00:47:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if you do find yourself more than curious about the single life, you'll talk to me about it right? 
2014-09-03 00:48:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Before bitterness builds up I mean 
2014-09-03 00:48:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess. I don't really see how this could survive that, though.
2014-09-03 00:49:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really? 
2014-09-03 00:49:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you're saying so things don't end bitterly?
2014-09-03 00:49:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would totally rather you sleep around a little bit than lose you forever
2014-09-03 00:49:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless after that you decided you enjoyed the experience more than me
2014-09-03 00:50:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Everything would be different.
2014-09-03 00:50:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think they would that much for me
2014-09-03 00:51:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially if it cemented how secure you were in wanting to spend the rest of your life with me
2014-09-03 00:52:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm I see.
2014-09-03 00:54:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just wrap it up lol
2014-09-03 00:54:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hag's OK.
2014-09-03 00:55:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*haha
2014-09-03 00:55:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So open relationship it is.
2014-09-03 00:55:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I won't sleep with anyone else
2014-09-03 00:56:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why not?
2014-09-03 00:56:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to
2014-09-03 00:56:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What if you meet someone and you do want to?
2014-09-03 00:57:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll talk to you about it 
2014-09-03 00:57:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool.
2014-09-03 00:58:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're the man of my dreams (literally)
2014-09-03 00:59:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that doesn't mean you can't enjoy other dudes.
2014-09-03 00:59:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Especially with us rarely setting each other.
2014-09-03 00:59:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe you'll look at guys differently now.
2014-09-03 01:00:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't understand how badddd sex can be. How dependent my enjoyment is on the guys anatomy and actions and manner.
2014-09-03 01:00:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*seeing
2014-09-03 01:01:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just have a hard time believing there aren't dudes you'd want to sleep with if you had the freedom to m
2014-09-03 01:01:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And how icky it feels when I sleep with someone I'm not comfortable with
2014-09-03 01:01:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean. Why did you want to bang me? You didn't know it would be good.
2014-09-03 01:03:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It had been a while haha. And I because I hadn't slept with you yet, I didn't know how good sex could be 
2014-09-03 01:03:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've ruined me
2014-09-03 01:04:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I had the chance, I would probably sleep with a woman though
2014-09-03 01:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know, man. Maybe it's more you than you realize. You said you've figured out more what you enjoy.
2014-09-03 01:04:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What does sleep with a woman mean?
2014-09-03 01:05:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have sex with a female 
2014-09-03 01:05:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I was into her
2014-09-03 01:05:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK and what does that mean.
2014-09-03 01:06:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, go back to her place and get naked and fool around? Unless that would upset you
2014-09-03 01:06:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm trying to understand what physically happens.
2014-09-03 01:07:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like you finger each other? Eat each other out?
2014-09-03 01:07:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You make each other cum with your mouths and fingers
2014-09-03 01:07:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean that's all I've really done. I guess sex toys could be involved
2014-09-03 01:08:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just didn't know what you meant.
2014-09-03 01:08:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you upset over this conversation?
2014-09-03 01:10:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess a little unsettled, but fuck it... we'll have sex with whomever and hope for the best!
2014-09-03 01:11:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you going to be paranoid now every time I'm out that I'm going to go home with someone?
2014-09-03 01:11:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha maybe. Once you do it a few times I'll probably get used to it.
2014-09-03 01:12:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or decide I can't handle it.
2014-09-03 01:12:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go out? Or sleep with someone?
2014-09-03 01:12:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sleep with someone.
2014-09-03 08:28:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Katie Silliman. I love you so much. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. I've never felt more sure about anything.
2014-09-03 08:28:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have no interest in sleeping with other women.
2014-09-03 08:29:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You are so sexy and passionate and giving you make our sex amazing.
2014-09-03 08:30:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Let me just emphasize how sexy you are.
2014-09-03 08:30:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like holy shit.
2014-09-03 08:31:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Every time you send me a sexy snap or I see your ass when we're videoing or when I'm looking at your straight up beautiful face, I can't believe how physically attractive you are.
2014-09-03 08:32:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It kinda bums me out that you'd be okay with me sleeping with other women, cuz I wouldn't want to do that to you, but I totally get why you're saying it and I know it's coming from a place of love.
2014-09-03 08:32:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really don't even like thinking about it, though.
2014-09-03 08:33:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You bring me so much happiness all the time and you make me feel ridiculously loved.
2014-09-03 08:36:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're the only girl I want to make sweet, looking into each other's eyes, love to after we've been apart for a stretch.
2014-09-03 08:36:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're the only girl I want to finger under the stars in the Montana wilderness.
2014-09-03 08:37:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And you're the only girl I want to spank the ass of, cum on the tits of, and fuck on the kitchen table.
2014-09-03 08:39:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm so excited I get to have sex with you for the rest of my life, and that you want to have sex with me for the rest of my life.
2014-09-03 08:40:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so let's not worry about that anymore
2014-09-03 09:14:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry I even mentioned it
2014-09-03 09:15:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nooo it's ok. I can definitely see where you were coming from.
2014-09-03 09:16:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'm just trying to be cognizant that the way we feel about each other now is not static
2014-09-03 09:18:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I want to be adaptable.
2014-09-03 09:19:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you're absolutely right, in that talking about hypotheticals like that now is only detrimental
2014-09-03 09:20:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's a pretty interesting perspective
2014-09-03 09:22:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"The rest of our lives" is a pretty long time, and I feel like relationships fail when someone's perspective changes and the other person doesn't keep up so to speak 
2014-09-03 09:22:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want that to happen to us
2014-09-03 09:23:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you're saying keeping things like "open relationships" on the table will prevent us from failing?
2014-09-03 09:24:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or decrease the probability I guess
2014-09-03 09:24:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe not on the table, but in a shoebox tucked away until it actually makes sense to bring out
2014-09-03 09:25:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-09-03 09:28:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even imagining being with someone else is horrible to me now, and it sounds like it's the same for you. So let's drop it!
2014-09-03 09:33:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. Yeah, I guess what I'm getting from this is our desires and feelings could change, and that our relationship and having sex with other people may not be mutually exclusive.
2014-09-03 09:33:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And so it might be worth having sex with other people at some point if it'd allow us to stay happy "together".
2014-09-03 09:36:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, I'm not a relationship expert obviously so it could be a really stupid idea. 
2014-09-03 09:37:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not a stupid idea, but I do kinda wonder how you would draw the line.
2014-09-03 09:37:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like could we be in love with another person?
2014-09-03 09:37:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Could we have a family with another person?
2014-09-03 09:37:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why even put labels on anything ever?
2014-09-03 09:37:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why get married?
2014-09-03 09:37:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why even say things like "I want to spend the rest of my life with you"?
2014-09-03 09:38:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We would draw the line by talking about it and figuring out what's best for "us"
2014-09-03 09:39:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should just keep my fucking mouth shut when I have stupid ideas like this
2014-09-03 09:40:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they aren't stupid ideas
2014-09-03 09:40:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially if you're going to runaway and take them to the extremes 
2014-09-03 09:40:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how am I taking them to extremes?
2014-09-03 09:40:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Why even put labels on anything ever?"
2014-09-03 09:40:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is that extreme?
2014-09-03 09:40:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Why get married?"
2014-09-03 09:40:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm dead serious
2014-09-03 09:40:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is that extreme
2014-09-03 09:41:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in the context of this conversation
2014-09-03 09:41:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you're acknowledging that people change
2014-09-03 09:41:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and sexual and relationship limitations could be bad for our specific relationship
2014-09-03 09:41:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]COULD!
2014-09-03 09:42:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No more talking about hypothetical aspects of our relationship
2014-09-03 09:42:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It never leads to anything good
2014-09-03 09:45:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I will say, by wanting to spend the rest of my life with you I'm committing myself to loving you no matter what superficial elements in our relationship change. There are things intrinsic to you that won't, and that's what I want to marry one day.
2014-09-03 09:46:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you
2014-09-03 09:47:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-09-03 09:56:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let me know if you ever want to run away and get married
2014-09-03 10:07:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Every damn day haha
2014-09-03 10:08:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-09-03 10:36:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, what was the context of that dude asking you to go home with him?
2014-09-03 11:59:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One of Priya's friends that we hung out with on Friday  fell in E-love with me for a minute haha. Talked about how I was "so chill and smart and not like other girls" and begged for me to go home with him after the bar. I said I was flattered but reminded him I had a boyfriend 
2014-09-03 12:00:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah OK haha
2014-09-03 12:00:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I figured MDMA had something to do with it
2014-09-03 12:00:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And his other 2 guy friends had ladies to go home with so he was probably just feeling lonely
2014-09-03 12:01:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What, you don't think I could get hit on by someone sober???
2014-09-03 12:01:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well just the way you described it and your reaction
2014-09-03 12:01:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you sounded very unoffended by it
2014-09-03 12:01:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even though it seems like a relatively forward proposal
2014-09-03 12:03:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I guess that's true. We had been hanging out all day I guess, and it was just a more pathetic version of "do you wanna get out of here." I guess I forgave him for forgetting the bf I'd mentioned a few times because we were all fucked up 
2014-09-03 12:03:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too many "I guess"s lol
2014-09-03 12:04:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-09-03 12:05:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's weird that you're describing it as pathetic
2014-09-03 12:05:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-03 12:05:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he might've not cared you had a boyfriend
2014-09-03 12:07:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe pathetic isn't fair
2014-09-03 12:09:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that can be the end of that convo
2014-09-03 12:09:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I
2014-09-03 12:09:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*K
2014-09-03 12:10:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love youuuu
2014-09-03 12:10:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love youuuuu tooooo
2014-09-03 12:10:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how would you feel about masturbating on video?
2014-09-03 12:10:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-09-03 12:11:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you've already made it clear that even naked pictures of me don't turn you on
2014-09-03 12:11:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]get the fuck out of here
2014-09-03 12:11:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-03 12:12:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My titty snaps don't give you a boner :/
2014-09-03 12:12:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just because I didn't become instantly erect when I saw the pic doesn't mean it didn't turn me on
2014-09-03 12:13:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you get sopping wet when you see a pic of me without a shirt on?
2014-09-03 12:13:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I definitely was looking at the snaps I saved of you either yesterday or the day before
2014-09-03 12:13:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I enjoy looking at them
2014-09-03 12:14:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I might've even listened to a certain email at one point
2014-09-03 12:14:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]voicemail*
2014-09-03 12:14:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh noooo
2014-09-03 12:14:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-09-03 12:14:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-03 12:14:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, I'd be down for some video chat sex
2014-09-03 12:15:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-09-03 12:16:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But maybe let's work our way there?
2014-09-03 12:16:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like be naked on video and see what happens
2014-09-03 12:16:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-09-03 12:19:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What brought that up?
2014-09-03 12:20:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm I guess how you said you have a vibrator to keep you satisfied
2014-09-03 12:20:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so if you're gonna be masturbating
2014-09-03 12:21:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why not watch, if you're down with it
2014-09-03 12:22:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm. Maybe you can watch me masturbate in person first? I dunno I feel like I could get a little self conscious doing it for the first time over video. But maybe not
2014-09-03 12:23:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's fine. No worries
2014-09-03 12:49:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm wondering if I should get rid of my AmEx and get a different card.
2014-09-03 12:50:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What are you looking for in a card?
2014-09-03 12:51:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just feel like I haven't really been getting a lot of benefits out of the AmEx
2014-09-03 12:51:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it has a $25 annual fee
2014-09-03 12:51:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I just spent all my points on paying off some of my credit card
2014-09-03 12:51:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it came to like $260 or something
2014-09-03 12:52:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and those were points accumulated over four years
2014-09-03 12:52:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I netted like $160
2014-09-03 12:52:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which seems not that good
2014-09-03 12:52:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah the fee thing is pretty shitty
2014-09-03 12:53:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the Chase Freedom card gets you 5% back on groceries
2014-09-03 12:53:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I guess might not amount to much in a year
2014-09-03 12:54:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well between that and groceries
2014-09-03 12:54:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Esp not the way you buy groceries
2014-09-03 12:54:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd probably be making more money than the AmEX
2014-09-03 12:59:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Capital One has a card with 1.5% cash back on all purchases
2014-09-03 12:59:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is there a fee?
2014-09-03 12:59:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-03 13:00:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's a Visa
2014-09-03 13:00:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]some high priced transactions I have I can't use my AmEx
2014-09-03 13:00:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so those would get included
2014-09-03 13:01:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's the limit?
2014-09-03 13:01:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean
2014-09-03 13:05:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The credit card limit
2014-09-03 13:05:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like $10,000
2014-09-03 13:06:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like it varies on your credit score
2014-09-03 13:07:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like $3k is common
2014-09-03 13:11:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure if I have excellent credit, though.
2014-09-03 13:11:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you missed payments? 
2014-09-03 13:11:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's all they card about
2014-09-03 13:11:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-03 13:11:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I might apply for this one then
2014-09-03 13:12:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're not supposed to cancel credit cards, right?
2014-09-03 13:15:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're not supposed to cancel them when they aren't paid off
2014-09-03 13:15:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-09-03 13:16:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And they probably let you do a balance transfer for a small fee so you move everything off your old card to the new one
2014-09-03 13:16:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I think I'm gonna go for that then.
2014-09-03 13:16:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't have a balance.
2014-09-03 13:16:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The AmEx doesn't allow it
2014-09-03 13:16:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure if it's even a real credit card
2014-09-03 13:18:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Doesn't sound like one
2014-09-03 13:18:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's a charge card
2014-09-03 13:19:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why is this credit shit so obfuscated
2014-09-03 13:25:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like I've got a "Fair" rating according to Credit Karma
2014-09-03 13:25:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-03 13:27:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Weird
2014-09-03 13:27:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have no idea how that stuff is done
2014-09-03 13:27:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you know yours?
2014-09-03 13:27:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anytime it's been checked for something people say it's fine
2014-09-03 13:28:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I've never been denied anything because of a credit check
2014-09-03 13:28:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've got to frantically get some reading done this afternoon. Love you!
2014-09-03 13:28:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok love you too!
2014-09-03 17:01:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tooooo muchhh readinggggg
2014-09-03 17:02:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My brain is going to mush
2014-09-03 17:02:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Speciation and journal clubs?
2014-09-03 17:02:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, mostly speciation
2014-09-03 17:03:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When do you meet with Jerry again?
2014-09-03 17:03:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really should've done some of it on Monday. I'm meeting with him 4p tomorrow
2014-09-03 17:03:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How much do you have left?
2014-09-03 17:03:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]3 papers, one of which is 20 pgs 
2014-09-03 17:04:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna skip a journal club
2014-09-03 17:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Maybe a little break and knock out some more?
2014-09-03 17:04:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You should be fine if you're skipping the journal clubs right?
2014-09-03 17:05:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I'm going to go to Zumba in 30 minutes
2014-09-03 17:05:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And skipping isn't a big deal, I just wanted to get better about going 
2014-09-03 17:06:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant in terms of prepping for speciation.
2014-09-03 17:07:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh, yeah I hope so. I'll probably read quite a bit tonight and get up early tomorrow
2014-09-03 17:08:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I'm sure you'll be fine!
2014-09-03 17:09:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well have fun at Zumba. Miss you.
2014-09-03 18:06:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what would you think about me leaving on Wednesday after Halloween?
2014-09-03 18:33:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean I'll have to work and/or go to class a significant amount on Monday and Tuesday 
2014-09-03 18:34:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And not work from home. 
2014-09-03 18:34:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess you could chill with me in the molecular lab, and we'd obviously get a couple extra nights together 
2014-09-03 18:35:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't need to go to work with you.
2014-09-03 18:35:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It wouldn't cost me anything.
2014-09-03 18:35:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So it's more about whether it's an inconvenience for you.
2014-09-03 18:36:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not expecting you to adjust your work schedule for me.
2014-09-03 19:52:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only an hour!
2014-09-03 19:52:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well look at you and your self-control
2014-09-03 19:53:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it was some much needed girl talk to so I'd say it was worth it
2014-09-03 19:53:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, good    😃 
2014-09-03 19:56:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmmm sexy snap
2014-09-03 19:56:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😉 
2014-09-03 21:55:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Get all your homework done?
2014-09-03 21:55:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mostly
2014-09-03 21:55:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have one question left for NLP
2014-09-03 21:55:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and one left for Bioinformatics
2014-09-03 21:56:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what about you?
2014-09-03 21:56:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meh
2014-09-03 21:56:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kinda hoped I could push ahead and not have to skip my journal clubs
2014-09-03 21:57:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I don't think that will happen
2014-09-03 21:57:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One of the speciation papers was denseee
2014-09-03 21:57:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what was it on?
2014-09-03 21:58:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Macroevolution, and theoretical models of how the rate of speciation can change throughout the history of a lineage 
2014-09-03 21:59:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-09-03 21:59:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I wake up early enough tomorrow I might be able to finish  up though so we'll see
2014-09-03 21:59:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how early is that?
2014-09-03 22:00:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]6a  😖😖😖😖
2014-09-03 22:00:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]barf
2014-09-03 22:01:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could've been reading right along this weekend 
2014-09-03 22:01:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I deserve the bit of uncomfortable cramming 
2014-09-03 22:08:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't believe you don't like hummus
2014-09-03 22:08:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't dislike it
2014-09-03 22:08:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It just doesn't blow my mind like I know it does for a lot of people
2014-09-03 22:10:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you like garlic?
2014-09-03 22:10:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-03 22:12:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's a garlic lovers hummus that is DA SHIT
2014-09-03 22:12:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just saying 
2014-09-03 22:12:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-03 22:12:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got an audible chuckle out of that one
2014-09-03 22:12:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me vs. food
2014-09-03 22:12:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]quick

2014-09-03 22:13:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which do you prefer
2014-09-03 22:13:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You
2014-09-03 22:14:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would eat moderately seasoned gruel for the rest of my life if it meant I could spend every day in your arms
2014-09-03 22:14:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OH
2014-09-03 22:14:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]EM

2014-09-03 22:15:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I set you up for a total cutdown
2014-09-03 22:15:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you went all lovey
2014-09-03 22:15:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can't believe it
2014-09-03 22:15:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Psh fuck you

2014-09-03 22:16:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-03 22:17:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you're truly my soul mate, you would never make me choose between you and good food O_O
2014-09-03 22:17:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha definitely not
2014-09-03 22:17:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love a happy Katie
2014-09-03 22:17:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that would definitely make for an unhappy Katie
2014-09-03 22:17:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha you know me too well, my dear
2014-09-03 22:19:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you
2014-09-03 22:19:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]only two weeks
2014-09-03 22:20:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:))))
2014-09-03 22:20:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you so much
2014-09-03 22:21:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you too
2014-09-03 22:22:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you do so many small physical things that have a really big effect on my well being
2014-09-03 22:22:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This has been one of the more stressful breaks from you so far for some reason 
2014-09-03 22:22:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, well we've sort of had a couple tifts already
2014-09-03 22:22:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm really going to appreciate every moment with you in a couple weeks 
2014-09-03 22:23:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're worth every tift
2014-09-03 22:23:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I meant tiff
2014-09-03 22:23:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*tiff
2014-09-03 22:23:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just so long as you still love me and want me afterwards
2014-09-03 22:24:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]always
2014-09-03 22:26:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess certain aspects of relationships are tricky with no clear moral compass
2014-09-03 22:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was actually reading a bit about open relationships today
2014-09-03 22:26:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and one thing I thought was odd
2014-09-03 22:26:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was how often the couples had a rule that said the extraneous relationships had to be casual
2014-09-03 22:28:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it seems like the point of being in an open relationship is to not prevent your partner from being happy
2014-09-03 22:28:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it seems sort of hypocritical to then say they aren't allowed to potentially fall in love
2014-09-03 22:28:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's the difference between an open relationship and a polyamorous one
2014-09-03 22:29:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]polyamory is the only logically consistent of the two for me
2014-09-03 22:30:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you've never had sex with someone you did not love at one time or another
2014-09-03 22:30:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sex and love do not go hand in hand for everyone 
2014-09-03 22:30:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get that.
2014-09-03 22:31:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm saying the rule stating you aren't ALLOWED to fall in love, essentially, doesn't make any sense to me
2014-09-03 22:31:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess that's fair
2014-09-03 22:32:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But the intent  going into  an interaction with someone can shape how it turns out 
2014-09-03 22:33:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So maybe stating "I don't want you to look for another person to love" changes how someone approaches their casual relationships 
2014-09-03 22:34:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get that too, I'm saying I don't think I could get down with that
2014-09-03 22:36:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can't separate relaxing conventional standards of sexual monogamy from relaxing standards of you you love?
2014-09-03 22:36:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why would the motivation for relaxing one not apply to the other?
2014-09-03 22:37:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]isn't the rationale for open relationships: sex is fun, people should be allowed to have it
2014-09-03 22:37:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with whomever
2014-09-03 22:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you substitute love for sex, it's the exact same thing
2014-09-03 22:37:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and is actually way more appealing to me
2014-09-03 22:38:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I though we were dropping this topic?
2014-09-03 22:39:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah. Hopefully it never comes up for real.
2014-09-03 22:39:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Don't think it'll work.
2014-09-03 22:51:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well hey there
2014-09-03 22:51:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm serious though, can we table any aspect if this discussion theoretical or otherwise
2014-09-03 22:52:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least until we talk about it in person? It does not translate well over texting 
2014-09-03 22:52:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, for sure.
2014-09-03 22:52:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had just read that stuff and had that thought.
2014-09-03 22:53:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know what we'd get out of talking about it in person at this point
2014-09-03 22:53:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm good with never talking about it within the context of us again, honestly
2014-09-03 22:53:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-03 22:53:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just don't see it ending well.
2014-09-03 22:53:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-09-03 23:00:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you still love me?
2014-09-03 23:00:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what if you actually hate me
2014-09-03 23:01:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the pheromones are just tricking you into thinking your intense feelings are love
2014-09-03 23:01:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you more than food apparently 
2014-09-03 23:01:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty hefty
2014-09-03 23:02:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhh the pheromone hypothesis is only how my became attracted to each other do quickly
2014-09-03 23:02:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even despite your hideous beard
2014-09-03 23:02:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-03 23:02:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-03 23:02:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're compatible on a molecular level 
2014-09-03 23:02:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And emotional 
2014-09-03 23:02:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think you've come out with the "hideous" yet
2014-09-03 23:02:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And physical 
2014-09-03 23:02:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And mental 
2014-09-03 23:03:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I know, I was just joking
2014-09-03 23:03:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what was that free hand doing in the pic?
2014-09-03 23:04:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying to masturbate but you keep interrupting 
2014-09-03 23:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-03 23:04:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let me watch?
2014-09-03 23:04:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]/participate?
2014-09-03 23:05:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Okkkkkk
2014-09-03 23:11:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry
2014-09-03 23:12:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's ok. That was my fault.
2014-09-03 23:12:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I shouldn't sent the snap in the 1st place
2014-09-03 23:13:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a tease I couldn't follow up on 
2014-09-03 23:13:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I appreciated the snap... you had already said you would want to try it in person first
2014-09-03 23:13:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't feel bad
2014-09-03 23:13:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry I ruined your mojo
2014-09-03 23:15:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send me a sexy snap? Maybe it's not totally ruined ;)
2014-09-03 23:17:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one sec
2014-09-03 23:19:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sent!
2014-09-03 23:28:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You truly have an amazing dick 
2014-09-03 23:54:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you fall asleep?
2014-09-03 23:56:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nope. Just read a chapter of Lolita. Maybe I'll finish it one of these days.
2014-09-03 23:57:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you even masturbate? Lol
2014-09-03 23:57:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No.
2014-09-03 23:57:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:/
2014-09-03 23:58:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, I'm going to sleep. Because I have to wake up in 6 hours. Goodnight, I love you!
2014-09-03 23:58:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too.
2014-09-04 00:00:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Night
2014-09-04 06:33:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhh
2014-09-04 08:33:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Now I'm the one having relationship problems in my dreams!
2014-09-04 08:52:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh no!
2014-09-04 09:33:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What was it about?
2014-09-04 09:34:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was getting with a redhead
2014-09-04 09:35:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the only other part I remember is sitting with her on my couch
2014-09-04 09:35:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and she was trying to be all girlfriend like and lying on me and shit
2014-09-04 09:35:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and my mom saw and gave me like a skeptical glance
2014-09-04 09:35:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-04 09:42:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So your adverse reaction to polyamory stems from your mother
2014-09-04 09:42:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very interesting
2014-09-04 09:42:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*open relationships
2014-09-04 09:42:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yes
2014-09-04 09:43:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-04 09:44:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not trying to open that discussion up again haha
2014-09-04 09:45:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just trying to be accurate!
2014-09-04 09:45:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know I know
2014-09-04 09:47:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is reading going?
2014-09-04 09:47:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that cat pic was pretty funny
2014-09-04 09:48:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meh
2014-09-04 09:48:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Going to EvProcesses in a few
2014-09-04 09:49:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-09-04 09:55:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man, that statement about me being adverse to polyamory seems to have rubbed me the wrong way... tell me something good!
2014-09-04 09:58:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-09-04 10:00:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm gonna take a break from hangouts until after 5p
2014-09-04 10:01:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good
2014-09-04 11:09:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now I feel all poopy
2014-09-04 11:09:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't mean to come across brusque 
2014-09-04 11:10:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't worry about it. I wasn't offended.
2014-09-04 11:10:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't feel bad. We're good!
2014-09-04 11:11:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We need to get rid of this unnecessary stress that's been plaguing us.
2014-09-04 11:11:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You can focus fully on your schoolwork knowing that I am completely in love with you and happy with you.
2014-09-04 11:12:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you so much.
2014-09-04 11:12:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you too.
2014-09-04 11:13:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it was naive to assume the long distance part of our relationship would always be easy
2014-09-04 11:13:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I prefer "optimistic"    😃 
2014-09-04 11:13:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'll be okay, though. We just ran into a couple of hiccups in this span that I don't think will be the norm.
2014-09-04 11:14:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll assume the past week or so is an outlier.
2014-09-04 11:15:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Perhaps. 
2014-09-04 11:15:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe when we see each other next we can talk about ways to avoid this stuff though, or work it out better
2014-09-04 11:15:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awww, man
2014-09-04 11:16:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-09-04 11:16:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've destroyed your optimism    😞 
2014-09-04 11:18:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No no no it's still there. We're definitely still going to spend the rest of our lives together and travel the world and raise the smartest, most attractive amoralists and then die within minutes of each other holding hands 
2014-09-04 11:18:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-04 11:18:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just trying to make sure we get there
2014-09-04 11:18:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know
2014-09-04 11:18:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-09-04 11:20:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok now I really will take a break until 5
2014-09-04 11:20:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you can send me snaps if you like :)
2014-09-04 11:21:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok    😃  good luck at your speciation meeting. 
2014-09-04 11:21:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you!
2014-09-04 11:21:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So much
2014-09-04 11:21:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm hugging you so hard in my brain right now.
2014-09-04 11:22:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel it!
2014-09-04 15:52:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ahhhhhhhggggggggggggggggg!
2014-09-04 15:54:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He cancelled on me
2014-09-04 15:54:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am so unhPpy 
2014-09-04 15:55:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But also ok with it
2014-09-04 15:57:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man! When did it get moved to?
2014-09-04 16:15:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tomorrow at 4
2014-09-04 16:15:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]aka softball time
2014-09-04 16:15:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Boooo
2014-09-04 16:15:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and my credit card still hasn't gotten here
2014-09-04 16:15:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and Darcy wants to go to Costco tonight and I'm broke!!
2014-09-04 16:17:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]daammnnnnn.
2014-09-04 16:17:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you need another loan?
2014-09-04 16:18:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Noooo
2014-09-04 16:18:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The credit card should come tomorrow
2014-09-04 16:18:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-09-04 16:19:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should be getting a belt tomorrow.
2014-09-04 16:21:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-09-04 16:47:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just found out some terrible news
2014-09-04 16:47:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might lead to the end of our relationship
2014-09-04 16:47:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-09-04 16:47:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Apparently
2014-09-04 16:48:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]my mom and dad are Alabama fans
2014-09-04 16:48:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh shit
2014-09-04 16:48:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Jesus Christ, Katie!
2014-09-04 16:48:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my palms are sweaty
2014-09-04 16:48:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, my mom doesn't really care that much
2014-09-04 16:49:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I guess when we lived in Alabama when I was like 2 for a couple years, they picked Alabama to support
2014-09-04 16:49:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man, that's a bummer for sure!
2014-09-04 16:49:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why didn't they pick Auburn?
2014-09-04 16:50:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're the underdogs.
2014-09-04 16:50:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They wanted to support the winning team?
2014-09-04 16:50:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ahhhhh I'm sorry it was a joke
2014-09-04 16:50:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's like supporting the Heat
2014-09-04 16:50:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😉 
2014-09-04 16:50:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*when they had LeBron
2014-09-04 16:51:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mom says that Dad will be told to keep his "Roll Tides" to himself at Thanksgiving
2014-09-04 16:51:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I always thought he said it ironically!
2014-09-04 16:51:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha noooooo
2014-09-04 16:51:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that will definitely be a strike for my parents
2014-09-04 16:52:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]please don't tell them
2014-09-04 16:52:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't anticipate our parents meeting for a couple years at least
2014-09-04 16:52:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They can be disappointed then
2014-09-04 16:53:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha ok
2014-09-04 16:53:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that is pretty funny, though
2014-09-04 16:54:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but seriously
2014-09-04 16:54:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my palms got sweaty
2014-09-04 16:54:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and my heart started racing
2014-09-04 16:54:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was in fight or flight mode
2014-09-04 16:55:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hahahaha
2014-09-04 16:56:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is this the end?
2014-09-04 16:56:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we'll get through it.
2014-09-04 16:56:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We'll have to work at it, though.
2014-09-04 16:57:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're apparently a Bammer at your core
2014-09-04 16:57:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was 2!
2014-09-04 16:57:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I even knew you lived in Alabama.
2014-09-04 16:58:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What part were you in?
2014-09-04 16:58:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Syracuse Birth-2, Birmingham 2-4, Katy 4-6, England for 7 months, then Katy
2014-09-04 16:59:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I was missing the Birmingham part
2014-09-04 16:59:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how funny
2014-09-04 16:59:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're the third straight girlfriend I've had who has lived in Birmingham
2014-09-04 16:59:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're definitely doomed
2014-09-04 17:00:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's not too unreasonable when you met the previous 2 at a school in Alabama
2014-09-04 17:00:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*unlikely
2014-09-04 17:00:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still funny
2014-09-04 17:04:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you know the Iron Bowl is that Saturday after Thanksgiving, right?
2014-09-04 17:04:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah
2014-09-04 17:04:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we just won't watch it with my dad
2014-09-04 17:05:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm honestly OK with it
2014-09-04 17:05:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]unless you think you could handle some mild trash talk
2014-09-04 17:05:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it wouldn't bother me at all
2014-09-04 17:05:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't hate Alabama fans by default like my Dad
2014-09-04 17:05:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-04 17:06:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's good
2014-09-04 17:07:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]who knows, my dad may even appreciate someone to talk football with him
2014-09-04 17:07:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can definitely do that!
2014-09-04 17:08:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you hit golf balls?
2014-09-04 17:08:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]never golfed in my life
2014-09-04 17:08:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]really? not even gone to a driving range?
2014-09-04 17:09:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope
2014-09-04 17:09:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought we've talked about this a bit?
2014-09-04 17:09:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my dad is apparently pretty good at golf
2014-09-04 17:09:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I knew you didn't play
2014-09-04 17:09:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but he never took me or anything
2014-09-04 17:10:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's right
2014-09-04 17:10:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's too fucking hot ooutside for golf
2014-09-04 17:10:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in Texas?
2014-09-04 17:10:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-09-04 17:10:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess probably not in CA
2014-09-04 17:11:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-04 17:15:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dad says the only Alabama gear he still has is a club head cover
2014-09-04 17:17:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I think we're in the clear
2014-09-04 17:25:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am super sore from Zumba
2014-09-04 17:25:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kinda embarrassing
2014-09-04 17:39:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, I just biked home
2014-09-04 17:39:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I kinda wonder how I'm gonna feel next week after a couple days of rest.
2014-09-04 17:39:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll have done 20 miles of biking this week
2014-09-04 17:39:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and two days of lifting
2014-09-04 17:40:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if it'll affect my stamina in bed?
2014-09-04 17:42:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like you'll have more stamina?
2014-09-04 17:42:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-04 17:42:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I kinda doubt it
2014-09-04 17:43:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the only time I feel like I'm really struggling is when I have to hold myself up for prolonged periods of time
2014-09-04 17:43:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I doubt it'll help with that
2014-09-04 17:44:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't know you ever struggled in bed
2014-09-04 17:45:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would say the times I haven't finished have been largely due to that
2014-09-04 17:45:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well factor number one is that we have just had sex
2014-09-04 17:45:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I need to focus a bit more to cum
2014-09-04 17:46:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and so if I experience some discomfort while holding myself up, it really makes it hard for me
2014-09-04 17:47:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should flip me on top then! Or I can go down on you
2014-09-04 17:47:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I always figured it was just because you were out of juice, so to speak
2014-09-04 17:47:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well the problem with you on top is I'd honestly never cum and probably have a hard time staying hard
2014-09-04 17:47:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've cum with me on top
2014-09-04 17:48:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not in the scenarios I'm describing
2014-09-04 17:48:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it that feeling-less with me on top?
2014-09-04 17:48:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-04 17:49:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not that it doesn't feel good
2014-09-04 17:49:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just that it's not stimulating enough if I'm fighting through a refactory period
2014-09-04 17:49:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-04 17:49:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]refractory*
2014-09-04 17:50:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now I feel like I'm making you have sex sometimes when you don't want to
2014-09-04 17:50:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nooooo
2014-09-04 17:50:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's never the case
2014-09-04 17:50:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I promise
2014-09-04 17:50:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Okkkk. Because you still enjoy those times, even if you don't cum?
2014-09-04 17:51:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the problem is really that the two positions that help me cum best are me on top and me behind you when you're lying down
2014-09-04 17:51:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and those both require me holding myself up
2014-09-04 17:51:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and yes, I definitely enjoy those times!
2014-09-04 17:52:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you sucking me off would probably work, but I think we'd have to pinpoint the things you do that feel really good, like I mentioned before
2014-09-04 17:52:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it's the same sort of thing
2014-09-04 17:52:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]any time of lack of stimulation basically makes it really tough to get back up close to cumming
2014-09-04 17:53:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Makes sense
2014-09-04 17:55:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what % of time that we have sex do you not have an orgasm?
2014-09-04 17:56:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like how many sexual interactions have we had where I didn't orgasm?
2014-09-04 17:56:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-09-04 17:56:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm
2014-09-04 17:57:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How many times do you think we've had sex?
2014-09-04 17:57:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no clue
2014-09-04 17:57:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just looking for a rough %
2014-09-04 17:59:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like 5%
2014-09-04 17:59:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so 1 in 20?
2014-09-04 17:59:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's happened like 5 times 
2014-09-04 18:00:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we've been in the same place for 43 days
2014-09-04 18:00:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we average 3 times a day
2014-09-04 18:00:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think it's still 3?
2014-09-04 18:00:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we've only had sex like 129 times
2014-09-04 18:01:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm, maybe like 2.8
2014-09-04 18:01:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so 5% seems like a reasonable guess
2014-09-04 18:02:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so we're at twice a week for 2014
2014-09-04 18:02:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we weren't dating for 2.5 months
2014-09-04 18:02:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and there's still four months left
2014-09-04 18:02:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not bad!
2014-09-04 18:04:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're averaging almost 5 times a week since we've been dating
2014-09-04 18:04:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]4.8
2014-09-04 18:04:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]over like 6 months you're saying?
2014-09-04 18:05:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We've been together 25 weeks
2014-09-04 18:05:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-09-04 18:06:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we might like having sex with each other
2014-09-04 18:06:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish I could share that stat, because it's pretty funny/impressive
2014-09-04 18:06:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I thought the same thing
2014-09-04 18:06:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm pretty proud of us
2014-09-04 18:06:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We've only been physically with each other 25% of the time
2014-09-04 18:06:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's actually not a terrible percentage
2014-09-04 18:07:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for long distance
2014-09-04 18:07:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but two weeks of it came in one big chunk
2014-09-04 18:07:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'd probably rather have a more even distribution at this point
2014-09-04 18:07:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]although I did love those two weeks
2014-09-04 18:07:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and think it's a big reason I've been having a particularly hard time the past week or so
2014-09-04 18:08:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those 2 weeks were pretty necessary after the summer 
2014-09-04 18:09:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But might've spoiled us a bit for sure
2014-09-04 18:09:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Based on our planned visits, we'll have been together 76 days by January 1
2014-09-04 18:10:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]about 26%
2014-09-04 18:10:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-04 18:10:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But more evenly distributed!
2014-09-04 18:10:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha not really
2014-09-04 18:11:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there will be two huge peaks
2014-09-04 18:11:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in August and December
2014-09-04 18:11:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think we did a pretty good job
2014-09-04 18:11:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for basically doing this on the fly
2014-09-04 18:12:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I meant the next few months are more evenly distributed 
2014-09-04 18:12:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah for sure
2014-09-04 18:20:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need to get a Snapchat hack
2014-09-04 18:20:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My screenshot skills have been lacking lately
2014-09-04 18:26:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, it honestly makes Snapchat way more enjoyable for me
2014-09-04 18:26:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can just look at the pic and decide after the fact whether or not I want to keep it
2014-09-04 18:26:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I can save videos
2014-09-04 18:32:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If we could send video over hangouts that'd be nice
2014-09-04 18:35:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]NFL starts tonight.
2014-09-04 18:35:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yessssss.
2014-09-04 18:35:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woooo
2014-09-04 18:36:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wanna wrap my legs around you
2014-09-04 18:36:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aww, I'd love that so much.
2014-09-04 18:37:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder how we would've handled six weeks apart like we originally thought was gonna happen early on.
2014-09-04 18:37:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know
2014-09-04 18:38:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The universe was rooting for us.
2014-09-04 18:38:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm glad we didn't have to find out
2014-09-04 18:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Same.
2014-09-04 18:40:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You were SUPER optimistic about that haha
2014-09-04 18:41:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean I fully admitted it would've sucked, but I still think we would've gotten through it
2014-09-04 18:41:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]August just might've involved a little more adjustment/reconnecting time 
2014-09-04 18:42:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, you're right.
2014-09-04 18:42:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we would know never to try that long again
2014-09-04 18:43:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Our longest is a little over a month?
2014-09-04 18:44:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]May 18 to June 18?
2014-09-04 18:45:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah that must be, right?
2014-09-04 18:47:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you. I'm so glad you love me too!
2014-09-04 18:55:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mom was aghast that I borrowed money from you
2014-09-04 18:56:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha yeah?
2014-09-04 18:56:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What'd she say?
2014-09-04 18:56:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That I can always come to her when I need money and blah blah blah
2014-09-04 18:57:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She asked what you were doing after school (again) and I mentioned we might move in together
2014-09-04 18:58:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what'd she think about that?
2014-09-04 18:58:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's ecstatic 
2014-09-04 18:58:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah??
2014-09-04 18:58:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's awesome!
2014-09-04 18:59:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's so weird, where she used to be all "girl you don't need a boyfriend, focus on school" now she's like really pushing me to settle down with someone
2014-09-04 18:59:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I think she can tell you make me very happy
2014-09-04 18:59:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that is interesting.
2014-09-04 19:05:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She also always had this thing about how weddings are a waste of money and she would pay me $10000 to elope 
2014-09-04 19:05:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And sent me this link on Sunday
2014-09-04 19:05:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ha!
2014-09-04 19:06:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, maybe she's just really into our romance?
2014-09-04 19:07:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe
2014-09-04 19:08:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$10k is a lot of cash
2014-09-04 19:08:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Weddings cost like 50k plus
2014-09-04 19:08:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WTF
2014-09-04 19:08:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no way my brother spent that
2014-09-04 19:09:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do people just take out loans?
2014-09-04 19:10:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]most couples spend less than $10k
2014-09-04 19:10:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]According to  http://www.costofwedding.com/
2014-09-04 19:11:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Average is 25!
2014-09-04 19:11:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's average though
2014-09-04 19:11:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if they're using "most" correctly
2014-09-04 19:11:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess most could be ambiguous
2014-09-04 19:12:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the average could be getting pulled up
2014-09-04 19:12:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want the median
2014-09-04 19:12:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]median is $18k
2014-09-04 19:12:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still a lot of money
2014-09-04 19:12:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but between two families
2014-09-04 19:12:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not bad
2014-09-04 19:14:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.xogroupinc.com/press-releases-home/2014-press-releases/2014-03-27-real-weddings-study-average-cost-of-wedding.aspx
2014-09-04 19:14:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right that's average, though
2014-09-04 19:14:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.slate.com/articles/life/weddings/2013/06/average_wedding_cost_published_numbers_on_the_price_of_a_wedding_are_totally.html
2014-09-04 19:15:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the median is like $10k less
2014-09-04 19:15:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so if you actually spend $28k
2014-09-04 19:15:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're probably in the top like 75th percentile or something
2014-09-04 19:15:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd like to see the distribution to know exactly
2014-09-04 19:16:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-09-04 19:17:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want like a 5 minute ceremony 
2014-09-04 19:17:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And a 3 day party
2014-09-04 19:17:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-04 19:17:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be fun
2014-09-04 19:19:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what would you even want out of a ceremony that short?
2014-09-04 19:19:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just to be able to walk up an aisle in a dress?
2014-09-04 19:21:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't even want to do that
2014-09-04 19:21:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All those people focusing on me does not honestly sound fun
2014-09-04 19:21:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can see that.
2014-09-04 19:22:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]soo just someone saying "I know pronounce you husband and wife"?
2014-09-04 19:23:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess
2014-09-04 19:23:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some cool music
2014-09-04 19:24:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A good friend of ours as the clerk
2014-09-04 19:25:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What is "cool music"?
2014-09-04 19:26:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know!
2014-09-04 19:26:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not a church hymn
2014-09-04 19:30:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-09-04 19:30:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just don't have any idea of what you're going for
2014-09-04 19:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess that's a little ways off
2014-09-04 19:31:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I guess I don't know either
2014-09-04 19:32:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'll figure it out in a couple of months when I propose to you
2014-09-04 19:32:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]j/k
2014-09-04 19:33:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ARE YOU GOING TO PROPOSE AT DISNEY OMMMMMMGGGGGG
2014-09-04 19:33:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-04 19:34:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did I ruin it?
2014-09-04 19:34:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mayyyyybeeee
2014-09-04 19:35:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck
2014-09-04 20:22:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ironically I'm watching Ep 2 of season 3 of sherlocks 
2014-09-04 20:22:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The wedding episode
2014-09-04 20:22:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, keeping with the theme!
2014-09-04 20:24:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've cried like 4 times 
2014-09-04 20:25:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha awww
2014-09-04 20:25:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Benedict Cumberbatch is so good
2014-09-04 20:26:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt
2014-09-04 20:26:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love that whole cast
2014-09-04 20:27:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to?
2014-09-04 20:27:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]watching football
2014-09-04 20:27:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]thinking about my girlfriend
2014-09-04 20:27:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]reading about convoluted neural networks modelling sentences
2014-09-04 20:29:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love that
2014-09-04 20:29:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How you encompass all those aspects
2014-09-04 20:30:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Loving, crazy smart, and down to chill out
2014-09-04 20:30:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw shucks
2014-09-04 20:30:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'd say I love the exact same things about you
2014-09-04 20:31:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why aren't you here cuddling with meeeeeee
2014-09-04 20:31:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Couch cuddling
2014-09-04 20:32:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha one of the things that really had me falling hard for you early on
2014-09-04 20:40:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My couch cuddling skills?
2014-09-04 20:40:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-09-04 20:41:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more how you sat basically on top of me
2014-09-04 20:41:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not on top of me
2014-09-04 20:43:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-09-04 20:43:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I had sat on you, you wouldn't have fallen for me?
2014-09-04 20:43:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope
2014-09-04 20:44:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-04 20:44:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it really is a completely different vibe
2014-09-04 20:44:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought (still think) the way you sit super close to me is really sweet and affectionate
2014-09-04 20:44:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sitting on top of me is more seductive I guess
2014-09-04 20:44:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or goofy
2014-09-04 20:45:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]depending how it's done
2014-09-04 20:46:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'm glad you vibe with my cuddle vibe
2014-09-04 20:47:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ha me too
2014-09-04 20:47:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's crazy how you this super important part of my life now
2014-09-04 20:47:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you weren't really anything 5.5 months ago
2014-09-04 20:49:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is crazy 
2014-09-04 21:01:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to cum in yo pussy
2014-09-04 21:04:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to cum on yo sick

2014-09-04 21:17:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Were you really going to propose to me this christmas?
2014-09-04 21:18:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-04 21:20:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you bummed?
2014-09-04 21:20:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha no
2014-09-04 21:21:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That would've been a little bit too soon
2014-09-04 21:21:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-09-04 21:22:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would've still said yes
2014-09-04 21:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, I had a feeling    😉 
2014-09-04 21:22:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'd hate to be estranged from my fiancé for another 4 months after the engagement 
2014-09-04 21:23:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that'd be a drag
2014-09-04 21:23:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd like to have a job for a bit
2014-09-04 21:25:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to be proposed to in front of a large number of people 
2014-09-04 21:25:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or my family
2014-09-04 21:25:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is a large number of people
2014-09-04 21:25:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess does that exclude public spaces
2014-09-04 21:25:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is more what I'm asking
2014-09-04 21:26:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-09-04 21:26:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-04 21:26:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not a mall
2014-09-04 21:26:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]DAMMIT
2014-09-04 21:27:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:/
2014-09-04 21:28:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should let me know what kinda ring you want
2014-09-04 21:28:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right now?
2014-09-04 21:28:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sure
2014-09-04 21:29:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like there'll be no element of surprise if I try to figure out what you want when I'm gonna propose
2014-09-04 21:30:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't given any thought to a ring
2014-09-04 21:31:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you want there to be a ring when I propose I guess?
2014-09-04 21:32:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well without a ring, I guess what makes the proposal special?
2014-09-04 21:33:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-09-04 21:33:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess me formally asking you to marry me?
2014-09-04 21:33:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't really asked you yet.
2014-09-04 21:33:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just tell you I'm gonna.
2014-09-04 21:34:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you know my answer already
2014-09-04 21:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-09-04 21:34:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know then
2014-09-04 21:35:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would feel special
2014-09-04 21:35:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What if my ring gets caught in a door and my finger comes off?
2014-09-04 21:35:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and romantic
2014-09-04 21:35:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-04 21:35:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we talked about that
2014-09-04 21:35:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don'tk now
2014-09-04 21:35:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe rings aren't our bag?
2014-09-04 21:35:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You ruined wedding rings for me!
2014-09-04 21:36:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw, man
2014-09-04 21:36:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ruined wedding rings
2014-09-04 21:36:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ruined proposals
2014-09-04 21:36:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why even get married at this point?
2014-09-04 21:36:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because it makes taxes easier
2014-09-04 21:37:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess
2014-09-04 21:37:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because we get to announce to the world our decision to spend the rest of our lives together
2014-09-04 21:37:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-09-04 21:38:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sooo are we just gonna one day decide it's time to get married?
2014-09-04 21:39:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will that ruin your sense of romanticism?
2014-09-04 21:40:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no just that romantic moment
2014-09-04 21:40:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess it's not a big deal to you?
2014-09-04 21:40:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No it is
2014-09-04 21:41:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we can make our own romantic moment?
2014-09-04 21:41:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-09-04 21:42:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like a day where we plan surprises for each other and exchange little romantic gifts and officially become engaged? 
2014-09-04 21:43:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do we decide on the day?
2014-09-04 21:45:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, it's a silly idea
2014-09-04 21:45:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not a silly idea!
2014-09-04 21:45:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to know how you feel about all of it.
2014-09-04 21:46:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I personally would enjoy proposing to you I'm pretty sure
2014-09-04 21:46:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if that doesn't sound fun or right to you
2014-09-04 21:46:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can definitely do something else
2014-09-04 21:47:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to take that away from you though because I'm trying to be modern and shit
2014-09-04 21:47:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's OK
2014-09-04 21:47:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can do the day thing
2014-09-04 21:47:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you'll be proposing to me in a way!
2014-09-04 21:49:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'd still be proposing to me
2014-09-04 21:49:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the person who sets the date for this proposal day would be the person "proposing" essentially, though
2014-09-04 21:50:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the rest would basically be an elaborate date
2014-09-04 21:50:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can't have a discussion together to decide when we want to become engaged? 
2014-09-04 21:50:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that discussion would be the proposal
2014-09-04 21:51:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is what I'm saying
2014-09-04 21:51:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so whoever brought that up
2014-09-04 21:51:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would be the one "proposing"
2014-09-04 21:51:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]essentially
2014-09-04 21:52:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we already both know that we want to marry each other! It's not a secret 
2014-09-04 21:52:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the case for most couples
2014-09-04 21:52:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm down with you soft-proposing to me
2014-09-04 21:52:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what we'll do
2014-09-04 21:53:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can set the date
2014-09-04 21:53:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nah
2014-09-04 21:54:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'll be more than an elaborate date
2014-09-04 21:55:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because then you'll tell me all the reasons you want to marry me and stare deeply in my eyes and get on one knee just like a normal person proposal
2014-09-04 21:55:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then you'll do it to me?
2014-09-04 21:56:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I don't have to
2014-09-04 21:56:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean, I have no idea how this is supposed to work
2014-09-04 21:56:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm legitimately asking
2014-09-04 21:57:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I thought it could be a little more organic
2014-09-04 21:58:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how so?
2014-09-04 21:58:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're talking our proposal to death right now lol
2014-09-04 21:59:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]proposal day
2014-09-04 21:59:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'm curious
2014-09-04 21:59:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I have nothing to worry about at this point, though?
2014-09-04 21:59:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't have to plan a date or anything
2014-09-04 22:00:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'll soft-propose to me and then we'll go from there
2014-09-04 22:00:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No no no
2014-09-04 22:01:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why does there have to be this big emphasis on  who  proposes
2014-09-04 22:01:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like what is your point here?
2014-09-04 22:01:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm saying
2014-09-04 22:01:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it can't be symmetrical
2014-09-04 22:01:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]us getting engaged
2014-09-04 22:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is essentially going to be popped by the person who brings up the discussion for the engagement day
2014-09-04 22:02:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not a big deal
2014-09-04 22:03:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]someone is not necessarily going to be expecting it
2014-09-04 22:03:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even if we both know it's coming
2014-09-04 22:03:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]only person can make the decision to say "OK, we're going to do this now"
2014-09-04 22:03:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But the whole point if getting married is becoming a team , a "we" 
2014-09-04 22:04:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can have a discussion and decide together
2014-09-04 22:04:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how will that discussion get brought up?
2014-09-04 22:04:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We talk about marriage every other week anyways
2014-09-04 22:04:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's all very abstract
2014-09-04 22:05:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why does it matter who brings it up?
2014-09-04 22:05:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and in the future
2014-09-04 22:05:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it doesn't!
2014-09-04 22:05:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because you're going to bring it up
2014-09-04 22:05:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why can't you bring it up?
2014-09-04 22:06:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because why wouldn't I just propose to you in that case?
2014-09-04 22:06:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then you should do that
2014-09-04 22:06:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no
2014-09-04 22:07:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why does the "element of surprise" matter so much
2014-09-04 22:07:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That the other person isn't expecting it
2014-09-04 22:07:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it doesn't
2014-09-04 22:08:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We don't even have to call it a proposal
2014-09-04 22:08:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can call it an engagement 
2014-09-04 22:08:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-04 22:08:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we decide together when we want to become engaged
2014-09-04 22:09:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-09-04 22:09:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I'm talking past you
2014-09-04 22:09:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or something
2014-09-04 22:09:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we aren't magically going to start this conversation at the same time
2014-09-04 22:09:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you acknowledge that?
2014-09-04 22:17:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're never going to get married
2014-09-04 22:17:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-09-04 22:17:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I fucked everything up 
2014-09-04 22:18:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still want to marry you
2014-09-04 22:19:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well then I look forward to your proposal at an unknown time and place 
2014-09-04 22:19:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]duuuude
2014-09-04 22:19:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-04 22:20:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what I want!
2014-09-04 22:20:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whenever you're ready to get married you can let me know
2014-09-04 22:20:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we'll have an engagement day
2014-09-04 22:20:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'll make you happy, it'll make me happy, we'll both cry
2014-09-04 22:21:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't have to placate me
2014-09-04 22:21:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't have to placate me
2014-09-04 22:22:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not a concession, though, if it's not something you want
2014-09-04 22:23:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we should do what feels right to you
2014-09-04 22:24:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Stop saying shit like that, we should do what makes both of us happy
2014-09-04 22:24:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't need to marry you
2014-09-04 22:24:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I told you that early on
2014-09-04 23:42:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-09-04 23:43:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you and I plan on loving you for the rest of my life... that's all that matters to me. Everything else is just details.
2014-09-04 23:47:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, I'm pretty much the same way that's why I feel so indecisive about the whole thing. Anything with you would be special and one step closer to the rest of our lives 
2014-09-04 23:47:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm glad it's settled :)
2014-09-04 23:48:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's settled in that I'm allowed to propose to you?
2014-09-04 23:48:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes!
2014-09-04 23:48:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-09-04 23:48:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That I want you to propose to me
2014-09-04 23:48:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok    😃 
2014-09-04 23:48:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we'll both enjoy it
2014-09-04 23:49:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you never did answer my original question
2014-09-04 23:49:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that started this whole thing
2014-09-04 23:49:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do I want a ring? And if so what kind?
2014-09-04 23:49:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-09-04 23:49:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or what kind of anythin
2014-09-04 23:49:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]g
2014-09-04 23:49:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that you might want
2014-09-04 23:50:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't make that decision right now
2014-09-04 23:50:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's fine
2014-09-04 23:50:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd have to go ring shopping
2014-09-04 23:50:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you're thinking a ring, though?
2014-09-04 23:51:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know, I'd have to look at them! 
2014-09-04 23:51:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha ok
2014-09-04 23:51:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is a lot of pressure 
2014-09-04 23:51:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aren't you supposed to intuitively know what I want?
2014-09-04 23:51:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if you pick the wrong thing, I decline the proposal?
2014-09-04 23:52:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-09-04 23:52:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would be down with trying to pick one out
2014-09-04 23:53:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I do think I need certain guidelines
2014-09-04 23:53:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we're not going to have wedding rings, correct?
2014-09-04 23:53:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or maybe I could just wing it?
2014-09-04 23:53:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd need to know your ring size, though.
2014-09-04 23:54:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well, we could have them
2014-09-04 23:54:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not crazy about the idea of wearing one.
2014-09-04 23:54:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But maybe I could come around on that
2014-09-04 23:54:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck man, every other ring I've owned has cost less than $20 and been a one size fits all
2014-09-04 23:54:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't even know how to find out my ring size
2014-09-04 23:55:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could go to a jewelry store
2014-09-04 23:55:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you didn't have class ring salespeople come to your high school?
2014-09-04 23:55:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah but I didn't want one
2014-09-04 23:55:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't get one either
2014-09-04 23:56:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess I don't remember my ring size
2014-09-04 23:56:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they had like these little plastic things you could stick your finger in
2014-09-04 23:56:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm totally ok with no wedding rings, as long as we get something symbolic of our eternal loveeeee
2014-09-04 23:57:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like tattoos
2014-09-04 23:57:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-04 23:57:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ring tattoos!
2014-09-04 23:57:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I mentioned that before
2014-09-04 23:58:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think either a ring or a necklace
2014-09-04 23:58:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for wedding stuff
2014-09-04 23:58:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For engagement 
2014-09-04 23:58:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or engagement
2014-09-04 23:58:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-04 23:58:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Leaning towards necklace
2014-09-04 23:59:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because I can wear it in the lab and it won't annoy me while I type and it won't cut my finger off
2014-09-04 23:59:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-04 23:59:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel kinda bad about how paranoid I've made you about rings now
2014-09-05 00:00:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I rarely wear rings because they annoy me anyways
2014-09-05 00:00:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I noticed that
2014-09-05 00:00:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you didn't make me paranoid, you just pointed me towards the articles that did
2014-09-05 00:00:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess so
2014-09-05 00:01:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I have short, stubby fingers
2014-09-05 00:01:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That don't improve with rings
2014-09-05 00:01:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha interesting
2014-09-05 00:01:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never heard that argument
2014-09-05 00:01:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've got small hands
2014-09-05 00:01:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]small slender hands
2014-09-05 00:02:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're not that slender
2014-09-05 00:02:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you have mannish hands
2014-09-05 00:02:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're kinda hairy
2014-09-05 00:02:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha

2014-09-05 00:04:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They fit pretty well there too

2014-09-05 00:13:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love the way you grab my ass sometimes when we're in bed
2014-09-05 00:15:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Reach down and almosttt touch my pussy, then grab a handful and pull yourself closer
2014-09-05 00:15:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, that's a lot of fun
2014-09-05 00:15:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can tell it really turns you on
2014-09-05 00:16:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and touching you and squeezing you like that really turns me on
2014-09-05 00:16:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's part of the reason it turns me on so much
2014-09-05 00:16:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I always know you'll be really wet once I do finally get to your pussy
2014-09-05 00:17:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it turns me on?
2014-09-05 00:17:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-05 00:18:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When I can feel your cock pushing against me

2014-09-05 00:18:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like how you sort of offer your neck to me
2014-09-05 00:18:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when you know I'm going for it
2014-09-05 00:18:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh I love it
2014-09-05 00:19:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love that I can make you feel so good.
2014-09-05 00:19:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It makes it so much fun for me.
2014-09-05 00:19:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And it turns me on so much.
2014-09-05 00:19:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Getting you writhing up against my dick.
2014-09-05 00:20:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Reaching down and grabbing my penis because you want it so bad.
2014-09-05 00:20:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've got me writhing right now
2014-09-05 00:21:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wish I could be there experiencing it.
2014-09-05 00:22:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would definitely have to eat you out for a bit.

2014-09-05 00:25:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sliding the tip in between my tits

2014-09-05 00:57:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My phone died!
2014-09-05 00:58:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll practice your orgasm noise and get back to you
2014-09-05 00:58:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had a feeling.
2014-09-05 00:58:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK. I really don't even realize I do it.
2014-09-05 00:59:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You like it, though?
2014-09-05 00:59:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love it
2014-09-05 00:59:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool :)
2014-09-05 00:59:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought I told you that your face/noises when you cum are part of my masturbating 
2014-09-05 01:00:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Stimulus 
2014-09-05 01:00:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I knew you said noises, but I didn't realize it was the noises I make when I cum
2014-09-05 01:01:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's awesome, though. I love how much you enjoy me cumming.
2014-09-05 01:02:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love how much you seem to enjoy cumming in me
2014-09-05 01:03:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do love it. Pushing myself deep inside you while cumming is crazy satisfying.
2014-09-05 01:05:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're gonna get me riled up again
2014-09-05 01:06:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm going to go to sleep now
2014-09-05 01:06:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-09-05 01:06:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's definitely do more naked videos in the future though
2014-09-05 01:07:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You were a natural...  don't know what you were nervous about!
2014-09-05 01:08:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've done it a couple of times, but it always feels awkward to get going 
2014-09-05 01:08:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I can see that.
2014-09-05 01:08:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I feel like it's a weird or unflattering angle 
2014-09-05 01:09:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I think I'd be good with face and titties honestly
2014-09-05 01:10:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The angle wasn't unflattering, though.
2014-09-05 01:12:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah thats what I figured
2014-09-05 01:12:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pussys don't translate as well in pixels
2014-09-05 01:13:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I suppose.
2014-09-05 01:13:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My dick looked okay?
2014-09-05 01:14:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah
2014-09-05 01:15:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good.
2014-09-05 01:16:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I hope you have lots of dreams of my cumming inside you and on you from all different angles.
2014-09-05 01:16:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should cum on my ass sometime
2014-09-05 01:16:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah?
2014-09-05 01:17:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'd be pretty sexy.
2014-09-05 01:17:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like when you're behind me, pull out instead
2014-09-05 01:17:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-09-05 01:18:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'd be fun.
2014-09-05 01:19:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anyways, I hope you also have dreams filled with my orgasms at the tips of your fingers
2014-09-05 01:19:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How would you feel about jerking me off into your mouth?
2014-09-05 01:20:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like not a blow job?
2014-09-05 01:21:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well it could be a blowjob. But to finish have like your mouth open and my dick just outside of it.
2014-09-05 01:21:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This would be a more you on your knees thing.
2014-09-05 01:22:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never done that before, but am definitely down to try. We should do on my knees on like a carpeted floor
2014-09-05 01:22:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or just not the bed
2014-09-05 01:22:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is it difficult?
2014-09-05 01:23:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You sink into the bed more than me so I have to bend over more, and I don't have as much leverage I guess
2014-09-05 01:23:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So yeah it's definitely be easier on solid floor
2014-09-05 01:24:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Sounds good to me.
2014-09-05 01:25:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In front of a mirror?
2014-09-05 01:25:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like blowing you in front of the mirror haha
2014-09-05 01:25:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely.
2014-09-05 01:26:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Turns you on watching yourself suck my dick?
2014-09-05 01:26:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-05 01:26:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I am a lucky man.
2014-09-05 01:26:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I get a full body view of you
2014-09-05 01:27:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha

2014-09-05 10:48:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like being naughty sometimes
2014-09-05 10:49:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely like having sex in inappropriate places
2014-09-05 10:49:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-05 10:49:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where have you had sex?
2014-09-05 10:52:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]An airplane, the stacks in my school library, a Bj on the roof of one of the dorms
2014-09-05 10:53:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]holy shit
2014-09-05 10:53:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're in the mile high club?
2014-09-05 10:53:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bathrooms during a party
2014-09-05 10:53:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]holy shit
2014-09-05 10:53:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-05 10:53:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you weren't lying
2014-09-05 10:53:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn dude
2014-09-05 10:53:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you were such a party girl
2014-09-05 10:53:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-05 10:54:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean they were all with significant others
2014-09-05 10:54:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you have sex in the library just to say you did?
2014-09-05 10:54:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or was it spontaneous?
2014-09-05 10:54:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just to say we did
2014-09-05 10:54:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-09-05 10:54:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you had sex in the airplane bathroom?
2014-09-05 10:55:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There was some significant under a blanket rubbing beforehand and then a very quick one
2014-09-05 10:55:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in the bathroom, though?
2014-09-05 10:56:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah. I kinda think now maybe the stewardesses knew 
2014-09-05 10:56:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh were you referring to the library
2014-09-05 10:56:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No the airplane 
2014-09-05 10:56:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-09-05 10:56:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one person just went and the other followed in a few minutes?
2014-09-05 10:57:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how old were you when you did this?
2014-09-05 10:57:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]18
2014-09-05 10:57:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-09-05 10:57:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, Elin was on that trip and she has no idea
2014-09-05 10:57:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Due to very weird dynamics going on at the time lol 
2014-09-05 10:57:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-09-05 10:58:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We kind of weren't friends at the time, and it was with my "technically" ex boyfriend 
2014-09-05 10:58:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though we were essentially back together for that trip
2014-09-05 10:58:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gotta get that sex in
2014-09-05 10:59:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]teenagers are ripe for sex in risky places
2014-09-05 10:59:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how did the library one work?
2014-09-05 11:01:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There are like 5 floors where absolutely no one goes
2014-09-05 11:01:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With lots of nooks
2014-09-05 11:01:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's sort of like a "thing" to do
2014-09-05 11:02:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess standing?
2014-09-05 11:02:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was on a desk
2014-09-05 11:02:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lying down?
2014-09-05 11:02:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh and I've had sex in our campus art museum!
2014-09-05 11:02:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]UChicago?
2014-09-05 11:02:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or Miami?
2014-09-05 11:02:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In a room filled with Jesus art
2014-09-05 11:02:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miami
2014-09-05 11:03:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no shit
2014-09-05 11:03:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you were lying on a desk just kinda out in the open?
2014-09-05 11:03:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and how did the art museum work?
2014-09-05 11:03:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There were shelves of books everywhere
2014-09-05 11:04:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I was sitting up with my legs wrapped around him
2014-09-05 11:05:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The art museum had a drinking thing the first Thursday of the month with cocktails and music
2014-09-05 11:05:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we found a dark room that was definitely supposed to be locked and it had a giant table in the middle
2014-09-05 11:06:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So you on the table I guess?
2014-09-05 11:06:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-05 11:06:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice.
2014-09-05 11:06:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wow.
2014-09-05 11:07:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You definitely did college right.
2014-09-05 11:07:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know if "party girl" is the right term 
2014-09-05 11:07:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For this case
2014-09-05 11:07:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sex fiend.
2014-09-05 11:07:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Perhaps
2014-09-05 11:08:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely didn't have an orgasm any if those times
2014-09-05 11:08:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except the library
2014-09-05 11:08:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I think I was more fiending for the risk 
2014-09-05 11:09:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's so hard for me to reconcile you wanting to settle down with someone. Haha
2014-09-05 11:10:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to settle down with a boring someone
2014-09-05 11:10:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to settle down with you!
2014-09-05 11:10:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We haven't done anything close to that!
2014-09-05 11:10:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The excitement of sex has never come from being with a new person
2014-09-05 11:11:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In all of those cases I was with that person for at least 6 months if not much linger
2014-09-05 11:11:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*longer
2014-09-05 11:11:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We've only had sex 120 times
2014-09-05 11:11:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't expect one of those to be on a plane 
2014-09-05 11:12:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-09-05 11:12:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean I'll never be able to top that stuff
2014-09-05 11:12:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]real talk
2014-09-05 11:13:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm fine with that
2014-09-05 11:13:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've already "topped" that stuff
2014-09-05 11:13:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In terms of my personal enjoyment
2014-09-05 11:13:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-09-05 11:15:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You keep assuming that my college lifestyle is indicative of never wanting to settle down, even though I've told you like a million times at this point how much I 1) prefer being in a stable relationship and 2) really love being in one with you
2014-09-05 11:16:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Relative to the majority of my friends, I didn't even hook up with that many ppl in college
2014-09-05 11:18:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess there's not really all that much evidence to suggest you want a long term relationship
2014-09-05 11:19:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and your history suggests relationships of < 1 year right?
2014-09-05 11:19:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]besides high school?
2014-09-05 11:19:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was in one for 2.5 years, and 2 for almost a year
2014-09-05 11:20:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One of which I was dumped very spectacularly and moped about it for 2 years
2014-09-05 11:20:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you were 23, your stats weren't that much different
2014-09-05 11:21:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you've had sex with like 14 people in the past five years or something, right?
2014-09-05 11:21:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not saying I don't believe you.
2014-09-05 11:22:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just trying to get you to understand why it might seem like a sudden change for me.
2014-09-05 11:22:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't have your luck in finding people who wanted to stay with me for 2+ years
2014-09-05 11:24:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What part of "I was super unhappy about my live life before you" do you not understand?
2014-09-05 11:24:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*love
2014-09-05 11:25:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I was actually off and on depressed 
2014-09-05 11:26:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm really tired of defending myself about this to you
2014-09-05 11:26:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you either listen to me or you don't 
2014-09-05 11:27:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I believe that you want to be with me... it just surprises me sometimes.
2014-09-05 11:27:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it shouldn't
2014-09-05 11:27:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's hard for me to disconnect your actions from how you felt
2014-09-05 11:28:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or understand how you could be doing things that didn't make you happy I guess
2014-09-05 11:28:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]see I don't even know if that's accurate
2014-09-05 11:29:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's not far from the truth
2014-09-05 11:30:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK, well I have to go to a meeting.
2014-09-05 11:30:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry I made you feel like you needed to defend yourself.
2014-09-05 11:30:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I believe you want to be with me.
2014-09-05 11:30:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-09-05 12:05:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Discussions like these make me feel even guiltier about things in my past I already don't feel great about. Like you have some "moral" high ground in this relationship because all of your previous relationships were serious
2014-09-05 12:06:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well you shouldn't feel that way.
2014-09-05 12:06:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I absolutely do not think I have a moral high ground on you.
2014-09-05 12:07:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But your dedication to this relationship can't be questioned 
2014-09-05 12:08:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because you've wanted to stay together forever with every other person you've dated
2014-09-05 12:08:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't question your dedication
2014-09-05 12:08:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might've early on
2014-09-05 12:08:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I know you love me and want to be with me now
2014-09-05 12:09:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even if that sometimes surprises me
2014-09-05 12:09:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]although like I said, it shouldn't
2014-09-05 12:09:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You just did multiple times this morning 
2014-09-05 12:09:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that wasn't my intent
2014-09-05 12:09:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't even questioning you in that message
2014-09-05 12:10:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was giving a reason why I might doubt it
2014-09-05 12:10:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You were pushing my stats in my face 
2014-09-05 12:10:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like "here are all the reasons you shouldn't want to be with me"
2014-09-05 12:11:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Explain"
2014-09-05 12:11:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'm sorry
2014-09-05 12:11:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should've just told me to fuck off
2014-09-05 12:14:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's just fucked up that my relationship history at all is a reason to doubt it.
2014-09-05 12:15:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really think that's fucked up, on principle, but it is fucked up in my case
2014-09-05 12:16:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just tell me to fuck off if you feel like I'm questioning you
2014-09-05 12:16:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've made it clear you love me and want to be with me
2014-09-05 12:16:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I believe you.
2014-09-05 12:16:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If I'm making you feel like I'm doubting that
2014-09-05 12:16:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just tell me to fuck off
2014-09-05 12:16:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I deserve it
2014-09-05 12:16:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-09-05 12:22:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You never opened my last video snap from yesterday 
2014-09-05 12:23:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I never got it?
2014-09-05 12:23:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]rewatches video of titty rubbing
2014-09-05 12:24:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-09-05 12:25:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the video definitely sent?
2014-09-05 12:25:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not showing up as unwatched anymore  
2014-09-05 12:26:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I dunno, maybe glitchy snapchap
2014-09-05 12:26:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was it the titty one?
2014-09-05 12:26:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It probably involved titties
2014-09-05 12:26:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I sent you 2 tittie ones
2014-09-05 12:27:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but, but, but
2014-09-05 12:27:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I only have one???!
2014-09-05 12:27:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😵 
2014-09-05 12:27:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You got some live action titty rubbing last night
2014-09-05 12:27:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So greedy
2014-09-05 12:28:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you seen yourself?!
2014-09-05 12:29:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Rubbing my own tits? Yeah I look down at it from time to time. 
2014-09-05 12:29:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant in general
2014-09-05 12:29:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you can understand where my greed comes from then
2014-09-05 12:30:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get more and more attracted to you every day
2014-09-05 12:30:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Interesting
2014-09-05 12:30:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like my peak attractedness to you hit in like July
2014-09-05 12:31:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And has yet to come back down 
2014-09-05 12:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah?
2014-09-05 12:31:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty interesting too.
2014-09-05 12:32:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There was some day when you were going or coming home from work were I was just blown away by how sexy you look
2014-09-05 12:33:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-09-05 12:34:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I gotta get to class and then I gotta finish up my homework afterwards so I'll talk to you later, love of my life.
2014-09-05 12:35:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry I was an asshole.
2014-09-05 12:42:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's ok, happens to the best of us.
2014-09-05 12:42:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you, have a great afternoon
2014-09-05 16:21:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Got the credit card, want me to book your oct 10 flight?
2014-09-05 16:22:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sure!
2014-09-05 16:23:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What dates?
2014-09-05 16:23:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Times? 
2014-09-05 16:23:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My algorithms professor didn't email me back
2014-09-05 16:23:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]about when our first midterm would be
2014-09-05 16:23:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Could you ask him in class?
2014-09-05 16:23:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but let's go ahead and say Wednesday, if that's okay with you?
2014-09-05 16:24:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well there are three exams in the class
2014-09-05 16:24:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you'd say one every five weeks
2014-09-05 16:24:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]of class
2014-09-05 16:24:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]+/- 1
2014-09-05 16:24:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I though you said there were only 2
2014-09-05 16:25:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this class has three
2014-09-05 16:25:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Bioinformatics has two
2014-09-05 16:25:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he gave me the date for the midterm
2014-09-05 16:25:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's October 8th
2014-09-05 16:25:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so we're good
2014-09-05 16:25:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the week of the 13th is the 8th week of class
2014-09-05 16:25:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I feel like we're unlikely to have an exam that week
2014-09-05 16:25:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it'd be too late for the first
2014-09-05 16:26:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and too far from the last one for the second
2014-09-05 16:26:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'll go ahead and assume it's more likely to be held on a Wednesday
2014-09-05 16:26:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well can't you walk up to him after class and ask
2014-09-05 16:26:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if we have to change it
2014-09-05 16:26:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll pay you back
2014-09-05 16:26:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-05 16:26:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll ask him next class
2014-09-05 16:27:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there ain't no cheap flights on Friday
2014-09-05 16:28:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What about Saturday to wed?
2014-09-05 16:29:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Saturday's not much better
2014-09-05 16:30:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found one for 236 total
2014-09-05 16:30:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Saturday to wed
2014-09-05 16:31:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]times?
2014-09-05 16:32:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that would work!
2014-09-05 16:33:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're gonna see each other a lot in that three week span if it all works out
2014-09-05 16:34:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]11/18 days
2014-09-05 16:34:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]there are 21 days in 3 weeks
2014-09-05 16:34:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]11/19
2014-09-05 16:35:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]starting Oct 11th to Oct 29th
2014-09-05 16:35:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll be here for your birthday!
2014-09-05 16:35:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah!
2014-09-05 16:35:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what year were you born?
2014-09-05 16:35:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]10/12/87?
2014-09-05 16:35:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeppp
2014-09-05 16:35:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what's your rapid rewards account?
2014-09-05 16:36:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I have one
2014-09-05 16:36:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]whattttt
2014-09-05 16:36:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha why?
2014-09-05 16:38:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]gotta get those points if you're going to be the one flying so much
2014-09-05 16:38:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you do with the point?
2014-09-05 16:38:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just created an account
2014-09-05 16:38:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you get free flights!!!!!!
2014-09-05 16:38:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]20336287834
2014-09-05 16:39:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just with rapid rewards?
2014-09-05 16:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how long does it take?
2014-09-05 16:39:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hmmm
2014-09-05 16:41:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got one after 5 flights
2014-09-05 16:41:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no shit
2014-09-05 16:41:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well yeah I'll definitely do that
2014-09-05 16:42:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]my flight cost 10,000 points roundtrip
2014-09-05 16:42:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I still have 5,000 points left
2014-09-05 16:42:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It doesn't look like I've actually flown Southwest in a while, so I don't htink I've been missing out.
2014-09-05 16:42:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-09-05 16:42:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from rapid rewards?
2014-09-05 16:42:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that seems like
2014-09-05 16:42:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]way too good
2014-09-05 16:42:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]five flights for one
2014-09-05 16:42:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean a couple of those were from LA
2014-09-05 16:43:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]they give you points based on the price
2014-09-05 16:43:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]of the flight
2014-09-05 16:43:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so you get there faster with more expensive flights
2014-09-05 16:43:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's what I figured. Still seems like a good deal to me
2014-09-05 16:44:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you fly a lot
2014-09-05 16:45:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]which right now we do
2014-09-05 16:45:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]exactly
2014-09-05 16:46:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might not have any finals either
2014-09-05 16:46:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I might bus up to you when I'm out of class.
2014-09-05 16:47:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how much does a bus ticket to chicago cost?
2014-09-05 16:48:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like $15
2014-09-05 16:48:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's for November, which is as far ahead as I can look
2014-09-05 16:48:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woah
2014-09-05 16:48:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then again
2014-09-05 16:48:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like a one way flight is $78
2014-09-05 16:49:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I could basically work for a few hours during what would've been that 20 hour bus ride
2014-09-05 16:49:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and break even
2014-09-05 16:49:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think they're having a sale right now, so I don't know if that price will still be there by the time you know for sure you don't have any finals
2014-09-05 16:50:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this was on Google Flights
2014-09-05 16:50:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'd be flexible
2014-09-05 16:51:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess this is getting a little ahead of ourselves
2014-09-05 16:51:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just excited at that prospect of seeing you a lot over the next few months
2014-09-05 16:52:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha perhaps. More relevant-are you going to bus to Houston on Tuesday night or wed morning before thanksgiving?
2014-09-05 16:52:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whenever you want tme to
2014-09-05 16:53:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm gonna fly in Tuesday
2014-09-05 16:53:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So Tuesday?
2014-09-05 16:53:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool, look to see if the bus stops in Katy
2014-09-05 16:54:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mom said it might
2014-09-05 16:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Megabus doesn't, but I can look into other buses I suppose
2014-09-05 16:55:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can pick you up from Houston, it's not a problem
2014-09-05 16:55:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK, I can't even purchase that ticket for a couple of weeks still.
2014-09-05 16:56:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh ok
2014-09-05 16:56:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'm getting mine now
2014-09-05 16:56:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]While it's cheap
2014-09-05 16:56:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good
2014-09-05 16:56:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when should I leave Katy?
2014-09-05 16:57:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sunday
2014-09-05 16:57:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-09-05 16:58:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know how to use this belt I bought, lol
2014-09-05 17:00:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I figured it out
2014-09-05 17:06:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No softball :///
2014-09-05 17:06:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bummer

2014-09-05 17:06:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-05 17:06:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was low key
2014-09-05 17:06:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's cool
2014-09-05 17:07:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I always over prepare for that shit
2014-09-05 17:07:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably a good thing
2014-09-05 17:08:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm gonna Zumba at 5:30 since I'm not getting my Friday "exercise" 
2014-09-05 17:09:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds good
2014-09-05 17:09:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]O
2014-09-05 17:09:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whoops
2014-09-05 17:09:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm getting all this cardio these days
2014-09-05 17:10:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I biked 20 miles this week, and it's gonna be 25 miles on full weeks
2014-09-05 17:12:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your chances of heart disease just dropped by 30%
2014-09-05 17:13:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be nice!
2014-09-05 17:13:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd still rather not bike.
2014-09-05 17:13:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-05 17:13:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]humans and are lack of ability to fully appreciate things that will happen in the future
2014-09-05 17:13:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ick
2014-09-05 17:13:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]our
2014-09-05 17:14:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna blame that one on me man-crushing on Jack White
2014-09-05 17:14:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Blame the typo?
2014-09-05 17:14:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-05 17:16:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=685613888128340&fref=nf
2014-09-05 17:17:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-09-05 17:18:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your future parenting technique?
2014-09-05 17:18:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I hope so
2014-09-05 17:18:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-09-05 17:18:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I don't have any finals
2014-09-05 17:19:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would see you for a month straight    😲 
2014-09-05 17:26:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I forgot to buy vinegar, so I didn't get to have pasta salad today :(
2014-09-05 18:34:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nooo
2014-09-05 18:35:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You better buy it soon, don't let all those veggies go to waste
2014-09-05 18:36:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'm gonna go tomorrow
2014-09-05 18:37:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying to decide if Supriya's bossiness (that borders on rudeness sometimes) is cultural or just her personality type
2014-09-05 18:37:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]could definitely be cultural
2014-09-05 18:38:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the way Indian students talk to professors at UTD always makes me uncomfortable
2014-09-05 18:41:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this little dog is so annoying
2014-09-05 18:54:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's probably a combination of cultural and me personally not liking being told what to do
2014-09-05 18:54:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will I get to visit your place ever?
2014-09-05 18:54:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or no?
2014-09-05 18:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-05 18:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you want
2014-09-05 18:56:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ehhh we'll see
2014-09-05 18:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I definitely don't think I'll ever feel "at home" here.
2014-09-05 18:57:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-05 18:57:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe a little nooky in your bed can help with that? 
2014-09-05 18:57:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha man I'd feel nervous I think!
2014-09-05 18:58:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I've figured it out
2014-09-05 18:58:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's like the dude is a child still
2014-09-05 18:58:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or 18
2014-09-05 18:58:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like he hasn't matured?
2014-09-05 18:58:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he inherited this business he works on
2014-09-05 18:58:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he works from home
2014-09-05 18:59:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know.
2014-09-05 18:59:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's strange.
2014-09-05 18:59:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kinda want to meet him 
2014-09-05 18:59:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just out of curiosity
2014-09-05 18:59:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm sure you could!
2014-09-05 18:59:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the only time he isn't here is when he goes to class, runs, or I guess goes to the grocery store
2014-09-05 19:00:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's never for more than like a couple hours at a time
2014-09-05 19:00:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think you could really pick up on the whole vibe just by meeting him
2014-09-05 19:01:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How is he like a child?
2014-09-05 19:01:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He sounds like he has a lot of rules
2014-09-05 19:01:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's sort of exactly it
2014-09-05 19:02:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like you know how certain kids are really rule based?
2014-09-05 19:02:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and struggle with any sort of greyness or ambiguity?
2014-09-05 19:03:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know a lot of middle aged adults who are very similar
2014-09-05 19:03:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I guess that's this guy
2014-09-05 19:03:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like an asshole talking about him
2014-09-05 19:04:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because he offered to drive me to school on MW when our classes overlap
2014-09-05 19:04:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, who else are you going to vent a little too 
2014-09-05 19:04:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he's nice to me in general
2014-09-05 19:04:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]true
2014-09-05 19:04:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's just such an odd living arrangement
2014-09-05 19:04:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you warned me!
2014-09-05 19:07:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you doing anything tonight?
2014-09-05 19:08:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've been very good about not saying I told you so
2014-09-05 19:09:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm hanging out with Darcy, Jim, Liz, and her husband in a bit 
2014-09-05 19:10:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-09-05 19:11:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So 5th wheeling again
2014-09-05 19:12:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you should be a pro by this point
2014-09-05 19:12:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I feel the same way about most CS topics you and other Darwinians feel about most biology topics
2014-09-05 19:14:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's encouraging!
2014-09-05 19:14:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]/disappointing
2014-09-05 19:15:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why??
2014-09-05 19:15:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It means you love what you're doing
2014-09-05 19:15:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]true, but it also means I think I would've actually enjoyed doing a PhD had I chosen the right field
2014-09-05 19:17:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You might get to go back 
2014-09-05 19:42:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So do we have any rules with Masters of Sex?
2014-09-05 19:44:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can watch it 
2014-09-05 19:44:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just let me know
2014-09-05 19:45:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-09-05 21:01:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And don't binge watch tooooo much 
2014-09-05 21:04:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just played some Dead Space
2014-09-05 21:07:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You like it?
2014-09-05 21:07:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. It's scary!
2014-09-05 21:07:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]shooting the limbs is taking me some time to get used to
2014-09-05 21:07:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-09-05 21:07:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kinda like it
2014-09-05 21:08:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That they make you switch it up
2014-09-05 21:08:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it's an interesting mechanic
2014-09-05 21:08:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And later you can use the severed  limbs to hurt them!
2014-09-05 21:08:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]spoilers, girl!
2014-09-05 21:09:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not spoiling the plot
2014-09-05 21:09:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's still a spoiler
2014-09-05 21:09:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now I won't be surprised when that gets introduced
2014-09-05 21:10:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry
2014-09-05 21:11:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm the worst

2014-09-05 23:09:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not sure. Maybe.
2014-09-06 02:24:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My phone died while I was out
2014-09-06 02:25:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I assume you're asleep, but I love you and miss you! 
2014-09-06 02:27:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a really good night, even though I was 5th and at some points 7th wheeling it. Darcy and I get along really well and it's kind of exciting to finally have a roommate who I'm actually friends with
2014-09-06 02:28:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's talk sometime tomorrow. Goodnight my live
2014-09-06 02:28:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*love

2014-09-06 08:55:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Morning 
2014-09-06 08:55:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah
2014-09-06 08:55:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Come give me kisses
2014-09-06 08:56:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, I wish!
2014-09-06 08:58:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My period started yesterday. So I'm feeling pretty bleck
2014-09-06 09:00:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. That has to be such a pain in the ass for women.
2014-09-06 09:00:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not great, that's for sure
2014-09-06 09:01:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was reminded by Masters of Sex yesterday that ovulation is induced in rabbits by mounting.
2014-09-06 09:02:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How many episodes did you watch?
2014-09-06 09:02:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Two
2014-09-06 09:02:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How many are there per season?
2014-09-06 09:03:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the second season is currently airing
2014-09-06 09:03:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]12 episodes
2014-09-06 09:03:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and there are 4 yet to air for season 2
2014-09-06 09:04:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well don't watch too many more without me!
2014-09-06 09:04:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK. So you want to watch them when we're physically together?
2014-09-06 09:04:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes 
2014-09-06 09:05:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And now I have to catch uo!
2014-09-06 09:06:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I can make it so I don't get my period during your visits except for winter break
2014-09-06 09:06:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then you'll have to rub my tummy and listen to me whine :)
2014-09-06 09:07:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Deal    😃 
2014-09-06 09:11:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Who was the third couple last night?
2014-09-06 09:11:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Peter and his girlfriend
2014-09-06 09:11:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-09-06 09:11:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mo and Roberto met us at falcon though
2014-09-06 09:12:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice.
2014-09-06 09:12:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had the best idea for a Halloween theme
2014-09-06 09:12:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Puppets!
2014-09-06 09:13:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]...
2014-09-06 09:13:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like Sesame Street, muppets, Jim Henson anything
2014-09-06 09:13:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Isn't that basically a Jim Henson party?
2014-09-06 09:14:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-09-06 09:14:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like it's too niche for Halloween
2014-09-06 09:14:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could have a Muppets party some other time of the year
2014-09-06 09:15:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not that niche!
2014-09-06 09:15:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's super niche!
2014-09-06 09:15:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If you went to that party... you'd have no idea it was Halloween.
2014-09-06 09:15:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, puppet harry potter
2014-09-06 09:16:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Jim Henson
2014-09-06 09:16:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Jim Henson
2014-09-06 09:16:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly 
2014-09-06 09:16:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But more options
2014-09-06 09:16:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's too limiting for Halloween.
2014-09-06 09:17:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what real Halloween is for 
2014-09-06 09:17:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Chuckie!
2014-09-06 09:18:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-06 09:18:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]go ahead and propose it
2014-09-06 09:18:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Team America 
2014-09-06 09:18:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pinocchio, obviously

2014-09-06 09:19:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hadn't thought of that one
2014-09-06 09:20:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bananas in Pajamas
2014-09-06 09:21:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bear in the Big Blue House

2014-09-06 09:27:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]GameDay probably never went to Miami, huh?
2014-09-06 09:28:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not that I recall 
2014-09-06 09:29:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Florida am has a pretty sick marching band if I'm thinking of the right team
2014-09-06 09:29:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]historically black school?
2014-09-06 09:29:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Carl actually went there for a semester I think
2014-09-06 09:30:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he definitely went there
2014-09-06 09:30:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whether or not it was for a semester I don't know
2014-09-06 09:30:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Huh
2014-09-06 09:32:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It got to 66 deg last night
2014-09-06 09:32:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Felt amazing 
2014-09-06 09:33:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I saw it's starting to get cool
2014-09-06 09:33:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm actually under a blanket now!
2014-09-06 09:33:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just means winter is coming
2014-09-06 09:33:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haah

2014-09-06 09:34:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Make sure you hydrate before biking!
2014-09-06 09:34:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I've been drinking a lot of water
2014-09-06 09:35:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe if Red Hat hires me to work remote I can move to Raleigh for Jan/Feb
2014-09-06 09:36:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol so whiny 
2014-09-06 09:36:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It still gets cold
2014-09-06 09:37:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not Chicago Cold
2014-09-06 11:30:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I fell back asleep lol
2014-09-06 11:31:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And dreamed we were having the most exquisite feeling sex
2014-09-06 11:31:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah? Like more exquisite than real life?
2014-09-06 11:32:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it probably felt just as exquisite 
2014-09-06 11:32:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh OK
2014-09-06 11:32:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it was enough so that I woke up wet
2014-09-06 11:32:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]!!!
2014-09-06 11:32:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you
2014-09-06 11:33:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty sexy
2014-09-06 11:33:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what position(s) were we in?
2014-09-06 11:33:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We started out on a hardwood floor, and you were touching me in a the right places
2014-09-06 11:34:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And when you entered me for the first time it felt like instant orgasm 
2014-09-06 11:34:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then you asked me where I wanted you to fuck me and I said "against the oven"
2014-09-06 11:35:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it was this really strange position that I don't think is actually physically possible
2014-09-06 11:35:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-09-06 11:35:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Everything was in slow motion 
2014-09-06 11:36:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what was the position?
2014-09-06 11:37:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and "against the oven" is so random
2014-09-06 11:37:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have a secret desire to be fucked up against an oven?
2014-09-06 11:37:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think so
2014-09-06 11:38:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how would you describe the position, though?
2014-09-06 11:40:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You were standing with your back to the oven and I was in front of you with my hands on the ground. My legs were up in the air and hooked on the handle behind you 
2014-09-06 11:40:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was like a weird wheel barrow
2014-09-06 11:40:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-06 11:41:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what an elaborate position!
2014-09-06 11:41:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like that would be a workout for you
2014-09-06 11:52:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And a high risk of a faceplant
2014-09-06 11:56:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah it's definitely not physically possible 
2014-09-06 11:56:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it sounds possible.
2014-09-06 11:57:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just not particularly enjoyable for you.
2014-09-06 11:57:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well maybe not
2014-09-06 11:57:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the angle of your pussy might not jive with the angle of my dick
2014-09-06 11:58:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We'd have to start with me inside of you and try to get to that position
2014-09-06 12:04:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know if real life Katie wants to try it
2014-09-06 12:04:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word, I didn't think so.
2014-09-06 12:04:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Felt good in the dream, though?
2014-09-06 12:07:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah 
2014-09-06 12:07:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Going to mello yellow for the first time 
2014-09-06 12:07:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's interesting how your brain would come up with that
2014-09-06 12:08:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-09-06 13:15:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't look into the details of my dreams too much 
2014-09-06 13:16:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some weird shit goes on in there
2014-09-06 13:16:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's all I meant.
2014-09-06 13:16:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]From like a neurological perspective.
2014-09-06 13:16:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What made those synapses fire.
2014-09-06 13:17:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well we were talking about having sex in weird places
2014-09-06 13:18:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And maybe the oven part was some very creative take on that?
2014-09-06 13:18:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm thinking the oven is related to something else
2014-09-06 13:18:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the two ideas got mashed up
2014-09-06 13:20:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably 
2014-09-06 13:20:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or it could be "random draw from surfaces in the kitchen"
2014-09-06 13:20:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to today?
2014-09-06 13:21:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]might hang out with some Auburn people
2014-09-06 13:21:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who I don't really know
2014-09-06 13:21:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that should be whom
2014-09-06 13:23:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like randos from the alumni group?
2014-09-06 13:25:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah. I had hung out with this girl and her husband once a while back. I can't remember if she was friends with both Dar and Hannah or just Dar.
2014-09-06 13:25:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I only hung out with them the one time time with Dar and Hannah.
2014-09-06 13:25:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I feel like that was a while ago.
2014-09-06 13:25:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But she was at the Auburn club last week.
2014-09-06 13:26:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I guess some other Auburn people she knows are hanging out today, so she invited me along, which I thought was nice!
2014-09-06 13:28:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That is nice. So for the game tonight?
2014-09-06 13:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we're gonna get some pool action in beforehand
2014-09-06 13:29:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I'm pretty excited about
2014-09-06 13:33:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A pool party??
2014-09-06 13:33:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm jealous
2014-09-06 13:42:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wanna video a little before you go?
2014-09-06 13:42:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sure
2014-09-06 13:45:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why'd you hang up?
2014-09-06 13:45:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're not showing up.
2014-09-06 13:46:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Try again.
2014-09-06 14:15:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can take your shirt off, but make sure you wear sunscreen!
2014-09-06 14:16:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh yeah!
2014-09-06 14:30:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude Amazon Prime Pantry
2014-09-06 14:41:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What is that?
2014-09-06 14:42:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Amazon now sells food and pantry products. You fill up a box up to 45 lbs and they deliver it to your door for $5
2014-09-06 14:42:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the food is so cheap!
2014-09-06 14:46:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No shit. I should look into that.
2014-09-06 14:47:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]45 lbs. is a lot of food too.
2014-09-06 14:48:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can you do frozen/cold stuff?
2014-09-06 14:48:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-09-06 14:48:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But they have mad cheap lucky charms
2014-09-06 14:50:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-09-06 15:51:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want some pizza and an IPA
2014-09-06 17:22:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are they not providing either of those?
2014-09-06 17:28:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We had some Coors by the pool and we're about to get some food to grill.
2014-09-06 17:31:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just pulled my scab off drying myself off.
2014-09-06 17:34:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha that sounds great! You're too picky
2014-09-06 17:35:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh I'm not complaining. That's just what I wanted in that moment.
2014-09-06 17:37:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I respect that
2014-09-06 17:37:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Need me to kiss your booboo?
2014-09-06 17:38:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yes, please. Kisses on the mouth too. I miss you!
2014-09-06 17:44:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Remember that day we spent by your pool getting tipsy and throwing the pool toy? Then we had great sex and took a 2 hour nap afterwards?
2014-09-06 17:45:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah. The good old' days.
2014-09-06 17:45:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love hanging out with you.
2014-09-06 17:45:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*ol'
2014-09-06 18:01:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bought presents for youu
2014-09-06 18:02:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol that's a lot of Mountain Dew!
2014-09-06 18:03:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I bought 48 oz of thick cut applewood smoked bacon
2014-09-06 18:03:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you can't have any of that
2014-09-06 18:03:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-09-06 18:04:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's a lot of bacon.
2014-09-06 18:04:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I'm sure you could tear through it.
2014-09-06 18:04:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you had seen me in costco you would've laughed.
2014-09-06 18:04:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Although the lack of sex might diminish your appetite.
2014-09-06 18:04:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All the deals!
2014-09-06 18:04:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha I'm sure.
2014-09-06 18:05:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm I thought sex was an appetite suppressant, didn't we read that somewhere?
2014-09-06 18:05:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also there were a ton of free food samples 
2014-09-06 18:05:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably. But it's Pavlovian at this point.
2014-09-06 18:06:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Am I gonna have to reign you in on the deals when we live together?
2014-09-06 18:07:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should not get a costco account, let's just say that 
2014-09-06 18:08:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘
2014-09-06 18:09:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you making lots of new friends? 
2014-09-06 18:19:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm actually just hanging out with Kate, Aaron (her husband), and get friend Mo from out of town.
2014-09-06 18:19:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I already knew those two.
2014-09-06 18:20:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it's good. We're watching the game now.
2014-09-06 18:20:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice, well enjoy. War Eagle!
2014-09-06 18:22:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww melting my heart. War Eagle!
2014-09-06 20:12:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh, I took the dreaded 2 hour late afternoon nap 
2014-09-06 20:15:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha feel weird?
2014-09-06 20:15:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, I'll just never be a me to sleep tonight
2014-09-06 20:17:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Too bad we can't take advantage of that ;)
2014-09-06 20:18:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very much
2014-09-06 20:19:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We take so many naps when we're together! Do you think it's a product of having as much sex as possible?
2014-09-06 20:20:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely for me. I never nap.
2014-09-06 20:20:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The number of naps I've taken after having sex with you is probably approaching the number of naps I've taken on my own.
2014-09-06 20:23:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably also related to me feeling really comfortable around you.
2014-09-06 20:23:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maaaan I miss you.
2014-09-06 20:23:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much... you know that?
2014-09-06 20:27:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a slight idea
2014-09-06 20:33:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What movie should I watch?
2014-09-06 20:45:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are your options?
2014-09-06 20:45:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We've chosen shark ado
2014-09-06 20:46:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*sharknado
2014-09-06 20:47:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word.
2014-09-06 20:57:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you going home after the game?
2014-09-06 20:57:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not sure. Might feel things out a bit.
2014-09-06 22:14:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where do I watch masters of sex?
2014-09-07 00:53:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm about to fall asleep, hope you're having fun! I love you
2014-09-07 01:07:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm on my way home if you can manage a few more minutes, but it's OK if you're tired!
2014-09-07 01:09:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can wait!
2014-09-07 01:11:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-09-07 01:15:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We're like 15 minutes away. I did Lyft and we were heading the wrong way :(
2014-09-07 01:15:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Booo
2014-09-07 01:15:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you not give them the address?
2014-09-07 01:17:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did. I guess it didn't interpret it properly?
2014-09-07 01:17:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This is a free ride, though. So it's all good.
2014-09-07 01:19:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice!
2014-09-07 01:19:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why is it free?
2014-09-07 01:20:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My first ride.
2014-09-07 01:20:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh. I don't remember if I had that deal
2014-09-07 01:22:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hurrrrrrrryyyyyy
2014-09-07 01:29:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In the door!
2014-09-07 01:31:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna type chat with you
2014-09-07 01:32:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good. Was just playing some card games.
2014-09-07 01:32:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We watched football!
2014-09-07 01:32:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But we did play cards for a while.
2014-09-07 01:32:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We played Presidents and Assholes for a bit and then Spades
2014-09-07 01:32:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We played Presidents and Assholes for a while actually
2014-09-07 01:33:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're so beautiful!
2014-09-07 01:34:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What'd you make?
2014-09-07 01:34:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's OK
2014-09-07 01:34:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so
2014-09-07 01:35:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We might hang out with this couple while you're here
2014-09-07 01:35:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There were four of us
2014-09-07 01:36:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it just got popular because of the name?
2014-09-07 01:38:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have to watch it?
2014-09-07 01:38:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why?
2014-09-07 01:39:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I was gonna cancel it.
2014-09-07 01:39:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But then I needed to get my belt.
2014-09-07 01:40:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And then said I could have the student rate.
2014-09-07 01:40:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know how now!
2014-09-07 01:40:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I sent you that snap!
2014-09-07 01:40:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No!
2014-09-07 01:40:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's a military belt.
2014-09-07 01:40:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not expensive
2014-09-07 01:40:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's not like shitty

2014-09-07 01:48:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for it to be a shitty thing to do
2014-09-07 01:48:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we do?

2014-09-07 01:48:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or something spoiled
2014-09-07 01:49:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aaron was showing me his entertainment system setup and he asked for a show
2014-09-07 01:49:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I said Masters of Sex
2014-09-07 01:49:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he played the last episode of the first season
2014-09-07 01:49:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I saw like a few seconds of spoiler
2014-09-07 01:49:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]s
2014-09-07 01:49:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he didn't realize he was playing the last episode
2014-09-07 01:49:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he meant to play the first
2014-09-07 01:50:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not really a spoiler
2014-09-07 01:50:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it's related to the Wiki
2014-09-07 01:51:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sleepy?

2014-09-07 01:59:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I agree. But damn if it doesn't make me feel like the luckiest man alive.

2014-09-07 02:04:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad. I love it when you're happy.
2014-09-07 02:05:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like seeing you happy too
2014-09-07 02:05:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know you do.
2014-09-07 02:06:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I really appreciate how much you care about my well-being.
2014-09-07 02:06:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't think I nag? You can tell me if I am
2014-09-07 02:06:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Absolutely not.
2014-09-07 02:07:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😃
2014-09-07 02:07:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you, Katie.
2014-09-07 02:07:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just really love you.
2014-09-07 02:09:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you I love you I love you
2014-09-07 02:10:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok now I really will try to go to sleep. You just get me so buzzed!
2014-09-07 02:11:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha aw.
2014-09-07 02:11:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I can let you go :(
2014-09-07 02:12:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll find you in my dreams
2014-09-07 02:12:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Having sex in physically impossible positions 
2014-09-07 02:12:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll meet you there.
2014-09-07 02:12:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha of course.
2014-09-07 02:13:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Katie's brain, make us have sex in space.
2014-09-07 02:13:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yessssss
2014-09-07 02:13:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]On the surface of the sun.
2014-09-07 02:13:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's a song about that
2014-09-07 02:14:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want us to be plasma as we're having sex and melt into each other.
2014-09-07 02:14:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's the song?
2014-09-07 02:14:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EpbjEttizy8&sns=em
2014-09-07 02:14:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I never thought plasma could be romantic 
2014-09-07 02:15:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-09-07 02:16:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight, love of my life
2014-09-07 02:17:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet dreams, beautiful. I love you with all my heart.
2014-09-07 02:17:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]+ mind, body, and soul
2014-09-07 02:18:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
2014-09-07 09:43:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WTF is this Yoodot thing?
2014-09-07 09:56:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never heard of it
2014-09-07 09:57:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK. You liked it on Facebook. I thought it looked kinda sketch.
2014-09-07 09:58:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh dear
2014-09-07 09:58:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely didn't mean to like it
2014-09-07 09:59:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It seems kinda spammy/malwarey so you might not have.
2014-09-07 10:09:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Knowing me I probably clicked on something dumb
2014-09-07 11:10:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you think Lyft drivers are paid to promote apps?
2014-09-07 11:10:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or like that's a job requirement?
2014-09-07 11:11:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What app were they promoting?
2014-09-07 11:12:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Milk Music
2014-09-07 11:12:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they weren't really blatantly promoting it
2014-09-07 11:12:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the guy asked if I wanted to listen to music
2014-09-07 11:13:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I said I'm down with whatever
2014-09-07 11:13:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he says I've got this music app called Milk and quickly explained the mechanic
2014-09-07 11:13:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I was just reminded of how that lady driver we had sort of came out of nowhere with that night sky app
2014-09-07 11:14:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm wondering if that's a revenue stream for Lyft
2014-09-07 11:14:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's pretty clever, if so.
2014-09-07 11:18:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One of my drivers did talk about Wave, but it's a map driving apps 
2014-09-07 11:18:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So that made more sense
2014-09-07 11:19:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you been on a Lyft where they didn't talk about an app?
2014-09-07 11:21:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ummm I don't know
2014-09-07 11:23:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That wouldn't surprise me though 
2014-09-07 11:35:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would be hard to enforce I guess
2014-09-07 11:36:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Apps may also just be a way of communicating and making small talk
2014-09-07 11:36:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which is why it would be really clever
2014-09-07 11:36:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like, I know you have a smart phone since you used lyft so we have that common ground
2014-09-07 11:37:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I guess it would be hard to enforce
2014-09-07 11:37:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm, yeah I don't know
2014-09-07 11:38:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just feel like three different apps seems like an odd coincidence
2014-09-07 11:39:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cam's not playing this week    😞 
2014-09-07 11:40:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]?
2014-09-07 11:40:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he's got a rib injury
2014-09-07 11:40:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cam Newton
2014-09-07 11:41:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] So sorry 
2014-09-07 11:41:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-09-07 11:42:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#DatSass
2014-09-07 11:42:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since when are you a panthers fan?
2014-09-07 11:43:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2010
2014-09-07 11:43:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not a Panthers fan
2014-09-07 11:43:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm a Cam Newton fan
2014-09-07 11:43:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ah gotcha 
2014-09-07 16:09:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]5 hours of lab work, not bad for a Sunday
2014-09-07 16:10:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not bad at all!
2014-09-07 16:11:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's the homework?
2014-09-07 16:11:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ha
2014-09-07 16:12:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haven't found the motivation yet
2014-09-07 16:12:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What've you been up to all day?
2014-09-07 16:13:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]watching football and spending too much time on Facebook/Reddit
2014-09-07 16:14:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What football games were on today?
2014-09-07 16:14:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's the first week of the NFL
2014-09-07 16:14:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so all of them pretty much
2014-09-07 16:14:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cowboys are getting spanked at the moment
2014-09-07 16:15:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-09-07 16:15:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what'd you do at the lab?
2014-09-07 16:18:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Organized samples, filled in my spreadsheet with collection data, and started 24 samples in a tissue lysis enzyme so they'll be ready to extract tomorrow
2014-09-07 16:19:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice! Sounds like a good day.
2014-09-07 16:20:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I forgot to pack lunch/snack though so I'm hangryyyy
2014-09-07 16:20:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well get you something to eat
2014-09-07 16:22:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dat's where I'm going
2014-09-07 16:36:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you look at amazon pantry yet?
2014-09-07 16:36:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a little bit
2014-09-07 16:37:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the lack of cold/frozen stuff makes it not super beneficial for me right now
2014-09-07 16:38:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you could order some stuff so you only have to bike back with the cold stuff
2014-09-07 16:40:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or like cleaning supplies, if the dude wants you to contribute to those
2014-09-07 16:40:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he has a maid
2014-09-07 16:41:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah
2014-09-07 16:41:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I'll do it.
2014-09-07 16:41:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not really in a groove yet.
2014-09-07 16:41:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]As far as eating goes.
2014-09-07 16:41:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I might be burnt out on PB&J for lunch too.
2014-09-07 16:42:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which is unfortunate.
2014-09-07 16:43:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Peanut butter, pickle, and potato chip sandwich!
2014-09-07 16:43:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pickle?
2014-09-07 16:44:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't know me at all    😞 
2014-09-07 16:44:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck
2014-09-07 16:44:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a 50% chance
2014-09-07 16:44:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why don't you get some deli meat and cheese?
2014-09-07 16:45:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'm thinking I'll do that.
2014-09-07 16:45:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might start doing a late lunch on TR
2014-09-07 16:45:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]some Chick-fil-A
2014-09-07 16:45:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yummm
2014-09-07 16:45:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]after I work out
2014-09-07 16:45:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]get that protein
2014-09-07 16:46:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This would be super easy
2014-09-07 16:47:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you
2014-09-07 16:48:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha why? 
2014-09-07 16:48:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In this instance I mean
2014-09-07 16:49:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you just really care about my eating habits
2014-09-07 16:49:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-07 16:51:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because I love you!
2014-09-07 16:51:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know! It makes me feel loved, honestly.
2014-09-07 16:52:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're trying to take care of me even when we're apart
2014-09-07 16:55:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gotta express all this pent up love for you  somehow
2014-09-07 16:55:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you like the snap I sent?
2014-09-07 16:55:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-07 16:56:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]such a goofball
2014-09-07 16:56:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I forgot, you don't like seafood! My bad, honey
2014-09-07 16:56:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]groans
2014-09-07 16:57:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-09-07 16:57:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm so funny
2014-09-07 16:57:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you definitely think so
2014-09-07 16:57:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I make you chuckle on a pretty frequent basis 
2014-09-07 16:58:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know. I like it    😃 
2014-09-07 16:59:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I've never really even thought about whether I'm funny or not
2014-09-07 16:59:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that probably means I'm not, huh?
2014-09-07 16:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You make me laugh 
2014-09-07 17:00:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But maybe not with overt humor?
2014-09-07 17:01:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'm trying to think what I do that makes you laugh now...
2014-09-07 17:01:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess my humor tends towards absurdity
2014-09-07 17:02:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Next time you make me laugh I'll take note of the circumstances
2014-09-07 17:02:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds good
2014-09-07 17:02:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmk, I'm going to practice my tuba a bit(!!!) because I'm going to audition for the wind ensemble
2014-09-07 17:03:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oooh fun!
2014-09-07 17:05:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]November 16 would be the concert 
2014-09-07 17:05:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]visit?
2014-09-07 17:05:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe
2014-09-07 17:06:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's during that shitty 4 week time, but honestly I don't want to go 4 weeks
2014-09-07 17:06:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't mind paying for your flight even if I'll see you again in a week and a half
2014-09-07 17:07:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, OK. I'll get half at the least, if not the whole flight.
2014-09-07 17:08:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should have my 50k miles from SWA by then so I can actually just gift you the miles and it'll be free
2014-09-07 17:08:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be nice!
2014-09-07 17:09:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hangouts has a  🎷  and a  🎺 , but no tuba    😞       
2014-09-07 17:10:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Typical
2014-09-07 19:15:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You better wear that Auburn hat to softball!
2014-09-07 19:15:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Actually, you might look goofy in ballcaps, huh?
2014-09-07 19:15:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I looked super fucking goofy when I had long hair
2014-09-07 19:15:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it all poofs out of the bottom
2014-09-07 19:16:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!!
2014-09-07 19:16:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well now I'm self conscious before even trying it on
2014-09-07 19:16:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-07 19:16:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]snaaaappppp
2014-09-07 19:24:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like it might be too big, but you don't look goofy!
2014-09-07 19:28:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😍 😍 😍   
2014-09-07 19:30:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'll need one more without a shirt on to really be able to tell
2014-09-07 19:38:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-09-07 19:38:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hair up or hair down?
2014-09-07 19:39:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooh I don't know! Let's go with up.
2014-09-07 19:54:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well?
2014-09-07 19:55:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Didn't get a notification... let me look.
2014-09-07 19:59:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That good, huh?
2014-09-07 19:59:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-09-07 19:59:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might've started thinking about the things I wanted to do to you
2014-09-07 20:00:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like what?
2014-09-07 20:02:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like walk up to you really fast and kiss you really passionately
2014-09-07 20:02:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and start sucking your tits and rubbing your pussy through your jeans
2014-09-07 20:02:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]while we're both still standing
2014-09-07 20:03:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then kiss down your stomach and pull down your shorts
2014-09-07 20:03:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and push you up against the wall
2014-09-07 20:03:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and start licking your pussy
2014-09-07 20:03:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and grabbing fistfuls of your ass while my face is in your crotch
2014-09-07 20:04:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and once you're really wet
2014-09-07 20:04:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]picking you up while you're still leaning against the wall and slide you on my dick
2014-09-07 20:05:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and fuck you really hard against the wall
2014-09-07 20:05:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then turn you around and lie you on the bed
2014-09-07 20:06:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and go in slow and deep
2014-09-07 20:06:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Face down or on my back?
2014-09-07 20:06:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]face down
2014-09-07 20:06:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'd be going really deep
2014-09-07 20:06:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]feeling your ass against my thighs
2014-09-07 20:07:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'd be kissing the back of your neck
2014-09-07 20:07:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'd reach one hand under you and squeeze your tit
2014-09-07 20:07:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you'd reach your hand down to your pussy
2014-09-07 20:07:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'd start going harder
2014-09-07 20:07:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you'd be moaning louder
2014-09-07 20:08:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and right when you climax I'd go really deep and cum inside you
2014-09-07 20:09:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you're feeling me cum as you're cumming
2014-09-07 20:09:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can we please fuck exactly like when I visit?
2014-09-07 20:09:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-07 20:09:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah!
2014-09-07 20:10:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No one I've dated has really been strong enough to pick me up and fuck me against a wall
2014-09-07 20:10:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you definitely could
2014-09-07 20:11:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we should do it then    😃 
2014-09-07 20:11:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you obviously like the idea?
2014-09-07 20:11:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very much so
2014-09-07 20:12:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just that description got me wet
2014-09-07 20:12:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yummm
2014-09-07 20:12:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like you like it when I muscle you a bit
2014-09-07 20:13:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybeeee
2014-09-07 20:13:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-07 20:14:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A good way to spice things up every once in a whole 
2014-09-07 20:15:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely works for me
2014-09-07 20:15:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I probably have a bit of a dom streak
2014-09-07 20:16:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah?
2014-09-07 20:17:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think a lot of people do to some extent, and sex can be sort of a healthy way to express it
2014-09-07 20:18:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah. Do you have one too?
2014-09-07 20:23:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like to be "in charge" sometimes, I've also wondered if that's not part of the reason I enjoy going down on you. Sometimes it does feel like a "submissive" act, but it also makes me feel very powerful
2014-09-07 20:24:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think the idea of being tied up excites me a little bit more than doing the tying, though 
2014-09-07 20:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I definitely feel like you're in charge when you're on top.
2014-09-07 20:25:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you seem to enjoy it
2014-09-07 20:25:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the blow job thing is actually pretty interesting
2014-09-07 20:25:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it can go both ways
2014-09-07 20:25:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah that's what I'm saying, it's context dependent
2014-09-07 20:26:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess me lying down makes it seem more like you're the dominant one
2014-09-07 20:26:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whereas me standing makes it seem like I'm the dominant one
2014-09-07 20:26:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess it doesn't even necessarily have to be the case then either
2014-09-07 20:27:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I definitely feel like I'm worshipping/serving you when I eat you out
2014-09-07 20:27:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm pretty into that
2014-09-07 20:29:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's funny, because when I cum it's almost a helpless feeling. Like I'm putty 
2014-09-07 20:29:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In your  hands so to speak lol
2014-09-07 20:30:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that even sort of plays into what I'm saying, though
2014-09-07 20:31:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I guess it's different
2014-09-07 20:31:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-09-07 20:31:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And so when I go down on you, what does it feel like?
2014-09-07 20:32:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]kind of like you're worshipping me, lol
2014-09-07 20:32:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when I'm standing for sure
2014-09-07 20:32:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah that makes sense
2014-09-07 20:33:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or like that time at the lake when you pushed my head down, that was definitely dominating
2014-09-07 20:33:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I liked it
2014-09-07 20:34:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mmm you're sexy
2014-09-07 20:35:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-09-07 20:36:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'll be interesting to see how things develop with us
2014-09-07 20:37:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sexually
2014-09-07 20:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's the most mysterious aspect of our relationship still
2014-09-07 20:38:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really?!
2014-09-07 20:38:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-09-07 20:38:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't think so?
2014-09-07 20:38:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't mean to put a !
2014-09-07 20:39:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it would be interesting to see how 40 yr old us have sex with each other, because I assume it'll be different than now if only in quantity
2014-09-07 20:40:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I don't know if anything qualitative will change drastically for a while
2014-09-07 20:41:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Every once in a while a new minor element works its way in
2014-09-07 20:42:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess I don't know. That's sort of what I mean about "mysterious"
2014-09-07 20:42:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I just found out you like having sex in inappropriate places.
2014-09-07 20:43:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I think we've been relatively tame as far as our sex goes so far.
2014-09-07 20:43:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I don't think either of us have any complaints.
2014-09-07 20:44:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe mysterious isn't the right word. While our relationship is pretty abnormally accelerated in most other areas, that's one where we're still learning about each other
2014-09-07 20:44:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At a fairly standard pace
2014-09-07 20:45:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess I just mean the most potential for surprise
2014-09-07 20:45:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is there something you wish we did sometimes that we don't?
2014-09-07 20:45:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I haven't thought about it!
2014-09-07 20:46:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is there something for you?
2014-09-07 20:46:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well now I really want to have sex against a wall lol
2014-09-07 20:46:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I think that'll be fun
2014-09-07 20:48:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm
2014-09-07 20:49:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess sometimes a finger in the back door can feel really good and really naughty at the same time. But if that's not your thing that's totally ok
2014-09-07 20:50:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could do that. I've never done it before, though.
2014-09-07 20:50:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure how I'd know when to do it.
2014-09-07 20:55:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe if I feel like it I'll ask you? I guess maybe sometimes when you're going down on me
2014-09-07 20:56:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, but it's not something you'd want surprised on right?
2014-09-07 20:56:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not that I'd ram my finger in your ass
2014-09-07 20:56:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I've thought about it when I was behind you
2014-09-07 20:56:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah?
2014-09-07 20:56:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-07 20:56:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That would be sexy
2014-09-07 20:59:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you put your hand down there so I can tell that's what you want to do, if I want it I'll definitely ask for it
2014-09-07 21:00:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I put my hand there and you give the go ahead?
2014-09-07 21:00:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-07 21:00:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-09-07 21:01:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like rub your finger over it. Even that can feel good
2014-09-07 21:01:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool.
2014-09-07 21:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're definitely the first girl I've been with who was into ass play, so that'll be new for me.
2014-09-07 21:02:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if you're not into it, then it wouldn't be enjoyable for me if you did it
2014-09-07 21:03:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nooo, I definitely want to do it if if it makes you feel good
2014-09-07 21:03:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how did you find out you were into it?
2014-09-07 21:03:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just decided to try it?
2014-09-07 21:05:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone did it when we were both drunk without asking, and I liked it
2014-09-07 21:05:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-09-07 21:06:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, I had anal sex a couple times before I lost my virginity.
2014-09-07 21:06:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Soooo yeah 
2014-09-07 21:06:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh really?
2014-09-07 21:07:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm surprised you were one of those girls
2014-09-07 21:07:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how old were you when you had anal for the first time then?
2014-09-07 21:07:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which girls?
2014-09-07 21:07:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that do anal before vaginal
2014-09-07 21:08:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't really consider that being a virgin anymore in any real sense of the word
2014-09-07 21:08:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True, but you can't get pregnant from anal
2014-09-07 21:08:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-07 21:08:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I was very effectively scared to death about getting pregnant
2014-09-07 21:08:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was 16
2014-09-07 21:09:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha seems so young
2014-09-07 21:09:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you are on the adventurous end of the spectrum sexually I'd say
2014-09-07 21:09:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably 
2014-09-07 21:10:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably as in 99% certain
2014-09-07 21:10:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-07 21:10:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't laugh at my sexual history, please
2014-09-07 21:11:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was the unwanted facial a drunken thing too?
2014-09-07 21:11:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or unasked for I should say
2014-09-07 21:11:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-09-07 21:12:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And a different guy
2014-09-07 21:12:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why didn't you like it?
2014-09-07 21:12:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because I got jizz in my eye and that really fucking hurts
2014-09-07 21:13:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]were you giving him head or what?
2014-09-07 21:14:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He was on top and pulled out and grabbed my head and pushed it down there
2014-09-07 21:15:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]these guys are ballsy
2014-09-07 21:15:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well who knows
2014-09-07 21:15:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I was hooking up with a bunch of girls maybe I'd do that too
2014-09-07 21:16:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The one who did that had been with 6 girls including myself at that point
2014-09-07 21:16:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think he just knew what he liked
2014-09-07 21:16:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just wouldn't have ever cum on your face or stuck my fingers in your ass the first time we had sex
2014-09-07 21:16:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-07 21:17:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it wasn't your first time with them
2014-09-07 21:17:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]without asking you
2014-09-07 21:20:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's the way some people explore sex with their significant others. When they become comfortable around each other they try stuff they like and hope the other person likes it too 
2014-09-07 21:21:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. Maybe I should just go for stuff more often.
2014-09-07 21:22:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess
2014-09-07 21:22:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the only thing I'd go for is cumming on your face, though
2014-09-07 21:22:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I already know you're not into it
2014-09-07 21:23:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you did it I wouldn't be unhappy with you
2014-09-07 21:23:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah, I'm good.
2014-09-07 21:25:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a fantasy of yours and I would get pleasure out of helping you fulfill that fantasy
2014-09-07 21:25:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll pop the second girl in our threesome
2014-09-07 21:25:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-07 21:28:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would it have the same effect if I was giving you a blow job and gave myself a facial?
2014-09-07 21:28:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-09-07 21:28:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I finished you off on my face
2014-09-07 21:29:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah. I'd prefer that.
2014-09-07 21:29:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I'm honestly good.
2014-09-07 21:29:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Knowing you're not into it is a turn off.
2014-09-07 21:32:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]People's tastes can change
2014-09-07 21:32:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I suppose so.
2014-09-07 21:55:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've done anal before though, right? Was that your idea or a girlfriends?
2014-09-07 21:56:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Only a couple of times.
2014-09-07 21:57:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Autumn suggested it. I actually think I just went for it with Hannah.
2014-09-07 21:59:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Word
2014-09-07 21:59:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We were both drunk, though. Maybe we don't have enough drunk sex?
2014-09-07 22:00:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our sex life is totally great
2014-09-07 22:00:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wasn't trying to insinuate it's not or that we're not adventurous enough
2014-09-07 22:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just joking. I don't think we'll ever be as adventurous as your past self, so I'm not really worried about it.
2014-09-07 22:02:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhhhhhhhhjjhggg
2014-09-07 22:03:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Stop it with the "ghost of Katie's past sex life"
2014-09-07 22:05:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sorry. Just acknowledging it and saying I'm not worried about it.
2014-09-07 22:06:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you see any of my photos on Google +
2014-09-07 22:06:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]?
2014-09-07 22:07:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The ones I posted.
2014-09-07 22:08:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So all the Google Backup ones, only I can see
2014-09-07 22:08:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless I hit Share?
2014-09-07 22:08:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-09-07 22:08:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So no one can see the ones of your dick except me?
2014-09-07 22:08:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-09-07 22:08:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Right.
2014-09-07 22:11:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want a sleepy Michael on my chest right now
2014-09-07 22:12:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Making my arm fall asleep 
2014-09-07 22:13:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha aw. That's a pretty sweet picture.
2014-09-07 22:36:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why don't we ever take pictures together?
2014-09-07 22:37:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-09-07 22:37:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We just have no pictures together. 
2014-09-07 22:38:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because no one we're around takes pictures.
2014-09-07 22:38:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And you don't seem to like getting your picture taken.
2014-09-07 22:39:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh
2014-09-07 22:41:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might've stalked your google+ photos a little bit  😕
2014-09-07 22:41:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've got a shit ton on there at this point.
2014-09-07 22:42:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still need tagged on a lot of the Black Cat albums
2014-09-07 22:42:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*tagged in
2014-09-07 22:43:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to go to sleep soon
2014-09-07 22:45:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you
2014-09-07 22:45:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]miss you too
2014-09-07 22:45:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]check out my 14 year old swag
2014-09-07 22:45:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://plus.google.com/photos/106790423608470264650/albums/5959921432153989057/5959921834476157202?authkey=CKie7IKUkf3hGA&pid=5959921834476157202&oid=106790423608470264650
2014-09-07 22:45:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or
2014-09-07 22:45:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]15
2014-09-07 22:45:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]almost 16
2014-09-07 22:46:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Was that the style? Or could you just not find a jacket that fit?
2014-09-07 22:46:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-09-07 22:47:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no I had no idea how clothes were supposed to fit
2014-09-07 22:47:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still swag
2014-09-07 22:47:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely swag
2014-09-07 22:58:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll chill out a little bit about the photo shy thing. I want to have some nice records of our relationship other than snaps
2014-09-07 22:58:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt we'll ever have the record either of us have had in the past
2014-09-07 22:59:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we lack parents and undergrad friends trying to show how much fun they're having
2014-09-07 22:59:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that was pretty cynical
2014-09-07 22:59:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unnessecesarily so
2014-09-07 23:00:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you've taken a ton of pictures yourself during previous relationships
2014-09-07 23:00:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that true?
2014-09-07 23:00:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Kelly -> parents around
2014-09-07 23:01:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think there are a lot of me and Hannah
2014-09-07 23:02:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There are like 200+ of you and autumn. And still plenty of ones from events the last few years
2014-09-07 23:02:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But if you're over doing that, it's cool
2014-09-07 23:02:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you look at those pics
2014-09-07 23:03:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they are from a relatively small number of events
2014-09-07 23:03:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and there were friends/family around to take them
2014-09-07 23:03:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I guess there are a few sessions of "selfies"
2014-09-07 23:03:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but Autumn was into that
2014-09-07 23:04:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or occasionally was into that
2014-09-07 23:05:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's whatever
2014-09-07 23:06:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah it is
2014-09-07 23:08:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you missed out on sexually wild Katie and I miss out on nonjaded Michael lol
2014-09-07 23:09:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aka our college selves
2014-09-07 23:14:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe college Katie and college Michael would've been perfect for each other
2014-09-07 23:14:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-07 23:15:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I prefer current/future Katie and Michael being perfect for each other
2014-09-07 23:15:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I don't like you writing off aspects of our relationship before they even happen
2014-09-07 23:16:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The best years are yet to come!
2014-09-07 23:16:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-09-07 23:16:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what am I writing off?
2014-09-07 23:17:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How adventurous our sex life will be and the likelihood of being around people having a good time and wanting to document it
2014-09-07 23:18:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-09-07 23:18:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was around grad students for two years
2014-09-07 23:18:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I took all the pictures
2014-09-07 23:18:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well are you going to stop taking pictures now?
2014-09-07 23:18:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even most of the pictures that exist of the Darwinians this year I took
2014-09-07 23:18:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-07 23:18:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-07 23:18:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but we're not going to be in them
2014-09-07 23:18:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you might
2014-09-07 23:19:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and all I'm saying about the adventurous stuff is we're never going to be having sex in an airplane or in a library
2014-09-07 23:19:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or in an art museum
2014-09-07 23:19:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and even if we did
2014-09-07 23:19:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it wouldn't be the same because you've done it before
2014-09-07 23:19:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not complaining
2014-09-07 23:20:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ahhhh there it is. 
2014-09-07 23:20:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah?
2014-09-07 23:20:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel very similarly about going to Disney with you, and moving in together, and even a little bit about one day getting married
2014-09-07 23:21:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]exactly
2014-09-07 23:21:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we need to shift our perspectives 
2014-09-07 23:22:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-09-07 23:23:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our shared experiences together are inherently unique, because we've never done them with each other before 
2014-09-07 23:24:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're still special, right?
2014-09-07 23:24:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, for sure
2014-09-07 23:25:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want sex with you to be the same as sex I've had with anyone else prior
2014-09-07 23:25:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because that obviously didn't work out in the long run
2014-09-07 23:27:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok... that wasn't really because of the sex, though, right?
2014-09-07 23:27:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't know where you're going with this.
2014-09-07 23:27:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're "wouldn't be the same" line
2014-09-07 23:28:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whatever, I'm trying to pep talk and failing miserably
2014-09-07 23:28:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're saying if we had sex in a museum it would be special because it's us?
2014-09-07 23:28:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure
2014-09-07 23:29:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've had sex in a natural history museum, and yet you still want to in the field museum 
2014-09-07 23:29:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-09-07 23:29:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are the odds of that actually happening
2014-09-07 23:29:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There you go, writing things off
2014-09-07 23:30:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not writing things off
2014-09-07 23:30:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think what we have is lacking or not special
2014-09-07 23:30:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm saying
2014-09-07 23:30:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we as two adults
2014-09-07 23:30:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Young adults
2014-09-07 23:30:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are unlikely to engage in the same types of risky sex you or I had as undergrads
2014-09-07 23:30:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and even if we did, it wouldn't really be the same rush as the first time
2014-09-07 23:30:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because that's how those things work
2014-09-07 23:31:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So let's not move in together after all, because only I'd be feeling the rush from buying furniture together and choosing and apt and blah blah blah
2014-09-07 23:32:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not really the same thing
2014-09-07 23:32:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]imagine we're at a party
2014-09-07 23:32:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we live together
2014-09-07 23:32:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you really gonna fuck me in the bathroom
2014-09-07 23:32:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-09-07 23:32:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why not?
2014-09-07 23:32:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know.
2014-09-07 23:33:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless you totally don't want to
2014-09-07 23:33:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So you'd have sex with me in a bathroom at a Darwinian party.
2014-09-07 23:34:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe not a tame one with 10 people and bananograms, but if it was a little rowdy and we were feeling frisky, sure
2014-09-07 23:35:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-09-07 23:37:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It hurt that you supported my fears about moving in together and Disney, cause those are things I'm genuinely concerned about 
2014-09-07 23:37:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm hoping you were just trying to make a point?
2014-09-07 23:37:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean supported your fears?
2014-09-07 23:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the experience isn't going to be the same for us
2014-09-07 23:39:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because you've never done those things before
2014-09-07 23:40:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah that sucks
2014-09-07 23:40:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]being "married" will still be new for me
2014-09-07 23:40:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it was really only on paper
2014-09-07 23:40:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nothing about our lives changed
2014-09-07 23:41:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Great, so I'll be living in someone's shadow until we get married for real
2014-09-07 23:41:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why do you think that?
2014-09-07 23:43:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whatever, I can't articulate it over text
2014-09-07 23:43:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm being dramatic tonight about stupid shit, I'm going to bed
2014-09-07 23:43:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight
2014-09-07 23:45:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we seem to struggle talking about our pasts
2014-09-07 23:45:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and both of our pasts are constantly in the face of the other person I feel like
2014-09-07 23:46:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]through social media
2014-09-07 23:47:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I don't like the way you talk about my past as predictive of how our future will be.
2014-09-07 23:48:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I struggle with a little insecurity about your previous serious relationships 
2014-09-07 23:49:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm insecure about your past
2014-09-07 23:50:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You shouldn't be. 
2014-09-07 23:52:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I can't help it.
2014-09-07 23:52:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I swear I'm not lying when I say that you have brought me sexual pleasure and excitement that nothing previous can even scratch
2014-09-07 23:53:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's just so ridiculous that you worry about it
2014-09-07 23:54:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Having sex in a bathroom would be WAY better if I actually had an orgasm. Or was madly in love with my partner. 
2014-09-07 23:55:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]weren't you pretty in love with the one dude, though?
2014-09-07 23:55:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-09-07 23:55:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was 19, I didn't know what love was
2014-09-07 23:56:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe once everything surfaces I'll quit having these episodes
2014-09-07 23:56:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or I guess we could just not talk about it
2014-09-07 23:56:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I feel like that's not ideal
2014-09-07 23:56:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Talk about that relationship?
2014-09-07 23:57:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is that what you're insecure about?
2014-09-07 23:57:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]past relationships
2014-09-07 23:57:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should have that talk in person then. Doing it over Skype and through texting clearly doesn't leave an impression
2014-09-07 23:58:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even really know what that talk would be
2014-09-07 23:59:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can just keep things going how they are
2014-09-07 23:59:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I just need to be cognizant of the fact my jealousy is misguided
2014-09-07 23:59:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when these things come up
2014-09-08 00:00:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll talk about it sometime soon, you shouldn't have any reason to feel jealousy
2014-09-08 00:01:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I still need some reassurance myself
2014-09-08 00:01:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]reassurance about waht?
2014-09-08 08:48:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm also jealous of the fact you've done a lot more in your life and have had the chance to sort of be wild
2014-09-08 08:49:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good morning to you too
2014-09-08 08:49:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, didn't realize you'd be up
2014-09-08 08:50:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying to get on work hour schedule 
2014-09-08 08:50:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh that's good
2014-09-08 08:51:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I don't know how to respond to this kind of jealousy in a way that'll make you feel better
2014-09-08 08:51:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, there's nothing you can really do about it
2014-09-08 08:51:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's my own fault
2014-09-08 08:52:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe "fault" isn't the right word
2014-09-08 08:53:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's the life I've been dealt
2014-09-08 08:55:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Does it not help to be excited about all the things we'll do together?
2014-09-08 08:57:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess not really. I'm excited about those things, but I feel like I never had the chance to be completely irresponsible and make bad decisions.
2014-09-08 08:57:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or I never chose to if I did have the chance because I'd be trained to take things seriously my whole life.
2014-09-08 09:00:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish I could make you feel better, but it kind of sounds like you're enjoying this pity party so I'll leave you Tobit
2014-09-08 09:00:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]* to it
2014-09-08 16:09:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was maybe a little too snappy of a response
2014-09-08 16:09:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry
2014-09-08 17:19:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all good. I wasn't worried about it.
2014-09-08 17:27:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Feeling better about things?
2014-09-08 17:39:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha for now.
2014-09-08 17:44:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's good I guess
2014-09-08 18:44:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Monday night football tonight?
2014-09-08 18:45:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'm watching it now
2014-09-08 18:45:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess there are two games on tonight
2014-09-08 18:46:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to this evenig
2014-09-08 18:46:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just went for a run
2014-09-08 18:47:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Haley is having a ladies wine night in her new apt
2014-09-08 18:47:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-09-08 18:48:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to make guacamole 
2014-09-08 18:49:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's swell of ya
2014-09-08 18:49:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What can I say 
2014-09-08 23:20:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey honey 
2014-09-08 23:21:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey. What's up?
2014-09-08 23:21:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got back from Haley's 
2014-09-08 23:21:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's up with you?
2014-09-08 23:22:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not much. Was reading some Lolita.
2014-09-08 23:22:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was Haley's?
2014-09-08 23:24:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was fun!
2014-09-08 23:24:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She made homemade tortilla chips and salsa
2014-09-08 23:26:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Molly, Misha, Haley and I hung out
2014-09-08 23:27:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's cool.
2014-09-08 23:31:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I guess I'll leave you to your reading 
2014-09-08 23:32:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!
2014-09-08 23:32:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Love you too.
2014-09-08 23:35:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are we ok?
2014-09-08 23:53:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-09-08 23:55:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-09-08 23:57:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Night
2014-09-09 10:56:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you just call me?
2014-09-09 10:58:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah but I remembered you were working
2014-09-09 10:58:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK. Yeah, I'll be done at noon if you want me to call you then.
2014-09-09 10:58:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah don't worry about it
2014-09-09 10:59:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what were you calling about?
2014-09-09 10:59:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just to talk
2014-09-09 11:00:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK. Well are you gonna be busy at noon?
2014-09-09 11:05:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can take a break, but if you need to bike to school or whatever it's not a big deal
2014-09-09 11:05:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I usually leave at 12:30
2014-09-09 11:05:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually might have some downtime right now
2014-09-09 11:05:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need to download some files that might take a while
2014-09-09 11:07:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can call me whenever before 4
2014-09-09 11:07:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-09 11:20:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let me try again
2014-09-09 12:28:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm getting a ton of ads for engagement rings now
2014-09-09 12:29:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would be interesting if those percolated to me somehow too
2014-09-09 12:29:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I went to a couple websites, so I think it's from that and not from our chats.
2014-09-09 12:30:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, but if Google knows we're in a relationship it might show me some wedding dresses or something
2014-09-09 12:31:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ooh that would be interesting.
2014-09-09 12:44:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll try to stay off those websites for a bit so as not to contaminate the experiment :)
2014-09-09 12:55:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you rather propose with a ring? 
2014-09-09 12:56:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No. I was looking at bracelets on the websites I was on.
2014-09-09 12:56:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like the idea of a bracelet, actually.
2014-09-09 12:57:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm wondering if there are insurance policies on these things, though.
2014-09-09 12:57:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha usually there are
2014-09-09 12:58:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-09-09 12:58:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You could also just find a very similar bracelet on a nonengagement site
2014-09-09 12:58:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely got me excited looking at them :D
2014-09-09 12:59:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, true.
2014-09-09 12:59:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😄
2014-09-09 13:00:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was looking for conflict-free stuff the site I was on seemed the best, and that's the one I'm getting ads for.
2014-09-09 13:01:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Diamonds!!!!!!!!! <><><><>
2014-09-09 13:01:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha just kidding
2014-09-09 13:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What was that symbol?
2014-09-09 13:02:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a diamond 
2014-09-09 13:02:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]<>
2014-09-09 13:02:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oooh haha
2014-09-09 13:02:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But yeah diamonds! If you're down with that.
2014-09-09 13:03:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe, I don't know!
2014-09-09 13:04:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not quite ready for that decision yet lol 
2014-09-09 13:04:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha OK. Well I can't afford them at this point, anyway.
2014-09-09 13:05:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I should've figured you might not be into that.
2014-09-09 13:05:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really haven't thought about it
2014-09-09 13:05:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We were talking about not having a proposal after all.
2014-09-09 13:06:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not one of those girls who planned their dream wedding out when they were a kid 
2014-09-09 13:06:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah I can tell.
2014-09-09 13:07:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which is a little surprising I guess because you seem pretty romantic, but I guess not necessarily in all the traditional ways.
2014-09-09 13:18:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've looked at wedding dresses a bit before haha
2014-09-09 13:18:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But planning a wedding sounds overwhelming
2014-09-09 13:19:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely like the idea of a proposal
2014-09-09 13:19:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just never expected to be in a relationship so open that we already have our life together planned out 
2014-09-09 13:20:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, our relationship is pretty nontraditional 
2014-09-09 13:21:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, but where are you going with that?
2014-09-09 13:22:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And you think it's our openness that has allowed us to talk about our future?
2014-09-09 13:24:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just explaining why the concept of a traditional proposal initially seemed weird for our case
2014-09-09 13:24:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you already know my answer 
2014-09-09 13:24:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because we talk about it all the time lol
2014-09-09 13:25:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, I guess knowing the answer doesn't really seem that nontraditional to me.
2014-09-09 13:26:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd say it's a pretty stupid, even immature, decision to propose not having discussed your future with the person.
2014-09-09 13:26:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I know
2014-09-09 13:26:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe it was the fact that you brought up the proposal details for discussion 
2014-09-09 13:27:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's not really traditional
2014-09-09 13:27:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like if you want a ring?
2014-09-09 13:31:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm I guess you joked about proposing in a few months and then I started giving things I don't want in a proposal
2014-09-09 13:31:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you said" you should let me know what kinda ring you want"
2014-09-09 13:32:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I guess I'm sort of understanding more where you were coming from now.
2014-09-09 13:32:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that started a cascade of me realizing I have no idea what I want in a proposal
2014-09-09 13:33:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to propose to you, but I want it to be something we'll both enjoy.
2014-09-09 13:33:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It will!
2014-09-09 13:33:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So talking about that makes sense.
2014-09-09 13:33:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still want it to be a little bit of a surprise, though :)
2014-09-09 13:34:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do too
2014-09-09 13:34:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So let's stop talking about it :)
2014-09-09 13:35:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One day when I'm ready I'll look into possible jewelry options I'd like and discreetly send them to you
2014-09-09 13:35:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good :)
2014-09-09 13:35:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much!
2014-09-09 13:35:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No more talking about proposals!
2014-09-09 13:36:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No matter how excited we are about it 
2014-09-09 13:36:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Very excited over here in Richardson.
2014-09-09 13:36:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]1 more thing though, you should ask both my mom and dad for their blessing beforehand
2014-09-09 13:38:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. I'm glad you said that. I was originally planning on it, but then I wasn't sure how you'd feel about that, being the empowered female you are ;)
2014-09-09 13:38:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My parents are old fashioned and would appreciate it
2014-09-09 13:39:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Should I ask your parents for their blessing?  😜   
2014-09-09 13:40:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha if you want!
2014-09-09 13:40:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"I'd like to ask for your blessing to be proposed to by your son"
2014-09-09 13:40:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-09-09 13:45:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Last thing from me. Don't pay attention to the cost. I highly doubt your tastes will lead you to anything that would be outside of my acceptable price range.
2014-09-09 13:45:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you saying I have cheap tastes????
2014-09-09 13:45:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know that'll be hard for you, but promise me you won't.
2014-09-09 13:46:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not at all. I'm saying you don't have gaudy tastes.
2014-09-09 13:46:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Man you know me too well
2014-09-09 13:47:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think having the biggest rock on the block is important to you, but maybe I'm wrong ;)
2014-09-09 13:47:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't ask for expensive things
2014-09-09 13:47:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know, just try really hard in this case to not worry about it.
2014-09-09 13:48:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's gonna be a symbol of our love for the rest of our lives.
2014-09-09 13:48:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want it to be perfect for you.
2014-09-09 13:50:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too much pressure!
2014-09-09 13:50:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you have a job I'll start exploring
2014-09-09 13:51:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also I'm dubious of my mom keeping cool about it for an extended period of time, so ask her like a couple days before the proposal
2014-09-09 13:52:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If the flower thing is any indication
2014-09-09 13:53:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK. I'll keep that in mind.
2014-09-09 13:56:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now no more!
2014-09-09 13:57:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Deal :)
2014-09-09 16:06:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I finished a blog post
2014-09-09 16:06:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At this rate, I may be done talking about my project by Christmas!
2014-09-09 16:07:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool. I'll check it out tonight. I definitely like what you're doing with it.
2014-09-09 16:08:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks honey
2014-09-09 16:19:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Holy shit lectures consisting of talking through an algorithm are terrible.
2014-09-09 16:20:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Really wish this guy used online resources more. Would definitely not be showing up.
2014-09-09 16:28:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How come you don't ever post pics of me for #mcm? :(

2014-09-09 19:20:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because that stupid video won't be cleared
2014-09-09 19:21:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It doesn't show up on mind anymore
2014-09-09 19:22:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not there if you swipe to the chat and scroll up?
2014-09-09 19:25:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll file the report
2014-09-09 19:25:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have a 4S right?
2014-09-09 19:28:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.bloomberg.com/image/i5kUtaPYUPf8.jpg
2014-09-09 19:28:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty interesting trend
2014-09-09 19:28:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder where it will stabilize?
2014-09-09 19:44:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I cannot find any other stats for other countries.
2014-09-09 19:45:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They all have marriage rate.
2014-09-09 19:45:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The number of people per 1000 that get married per year.
2014-09-09 19:45:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's not what I want!
2014-09-09 19:45:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to know how many single people are in Sweden.
2014-09-09 19:45:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or France.
2014-09-09 22:05:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry my phone died at 7:22
2014-09-09 22:05:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When I swipe over I can't see any snap history except the most recent 
2014-09-09 22:06:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wait a second, one of the boys Theon burned was the paralyzed kid?
2014-09-09 22:06:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think the issue is with YOUR phone 
2014-09-09 22:06:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-09 22:06:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's a bug on my phone
2014-09-09 22:06:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have a 4S right?
2014-09-09 22:06:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-09 22:06:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What episode of GoT are you on?
2014-09-09 22:07:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]8
2014-09-09 22:07:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't realize it was those kids at the end of the last episode
2014-09-09 22:07:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I wasn't paying close enough attention.
2014-09-09 22:07:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I kinda struggle with that with this show.
2014-09-09 22:08:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's so fucked up
2014-09-09 22:08:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and so hard to believe based on what we know about him to this point.
2014-09-09 22:08:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Clearly
2014-09-09 22:09:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Episode 8 should explain who was killed and why
2014-09-09 22:09:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-09-09 22:09:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you have a 4S, woman?
2014-09-09 22:09:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes!
2014-09-09 22:09:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've already said yes but you're asking too many simultaneous questions
2014-09-09 22:09:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why do you use kinetics
2014-09-10 01:01:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://dfw.cbslocal.com/top-lists/best-bars-for-cornhole-in-dfw/
2014-09-10 01:18:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was quick!
2014-09-10 01:18:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-10 01:18:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't even get to say I missed you
2014-09-10 01:20:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What??
2014-09-10 01:21:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You closed the window take quick haha
2014-09-10 01:21:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We said "I love you" and "I miss you" 100 times during that convo lol
2014-09-10 01:21:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's OK.
2014-09-10 01:21:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much.
2014-09-10 01:21:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really, really miss you.
2014-09-10 01:22:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't wait to hold you again.
2014-09-10 01:22:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And kiss your lips.
2014-09-10 01:23:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And hold your hand.
2014-09-10 01:23:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And hold my hand while holding me and kissing my lips!
2014-09-10 01:23:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like how you like holding my hand during sex, by the way. I don't know if I've ever mentioned that.
2014-09-10 01:24:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It makes me feel even more connected to you
2014-09-10 01:25:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And sometimes I need something to hold on to when I start to cum haha
2014-09-10 01:26:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well both of those work for me.
2014-09-10 01:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Mmm can't wait to make you cum either.
2014-09-10 01:27:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not soon enough 
2014-09-10 01:27:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You are so worth all of this long distance bs
2014-09-10 01:27:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In every way
2014-09-10 01:28:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D so are you my love.
2014-09-10 01:29:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know I'm a downer sometimes, but I really do believe we have something really special/magical between us.
2014-09-10 01:30:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😄
2014-09-10 01:30:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We really do!
2014-09-10 01:30:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You provide my life with so much happiness and meaning.
2014-09-10 01:30:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's amazing.
2014-09-10 01:31:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And moments of just pure bliss.
2014-09-10 01:31:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Even from just simple things.
2014-09-10 01:32:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want it to be that way for the rest of our lives
2014-09-10 01:32:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too. I think it can be if we want it to.
2014-09-10 01:33:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you so much
2014-09-10 01:34:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know. It's hard for me to believe sometimes.
2014-09-10 01:35:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're a pretty amazing guy.
2014-09-10 01:35:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]God I want to make love to you!
2014-09-10 01:35:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A little over a week.
2014-09-10 01:36:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That would be pretty swell right now
2014-09-10 01:36:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The way you love me makes it feel like you were designed just for me
2014-09-10 01:37:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's perfection 
2014-09-10 01:37:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel the same way. Like I feel just overwhelmed with feelings of love for you right now.
2014-09-10 01:38:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But when we're together I feel like I can just constantly be giving you my love and it feels awesome.
2014-09-10 01:39:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And it's just an amazing positive feedback loop.
2014-09-10 01:40:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a good way to put it. Being together gives a very natural outlet for our intense feelings for each other
2014-09-10 01:40:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. And we're both very receptive to being shown love, so it works out perfectly.
2014-09-10 01:41:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So many times you probably see me cuddling a pillow over video because I have to cuddle  something
2014-09-10 01:41:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If not you
2014-09-10 01:41:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah.
2014-09-10 01:41:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's so hard signing off from video.
2014-09-10 01:42:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're so beautiful, and your eyes really communicate your feelings for me.
2014-09-10 01:43:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Even early on in the relationship the way you looked at me was really powerful and emotional.
2014-09-10 01:43:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aw that was just the pheromones 
2014-09-10 01:44:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha probably.
2014-09-10 01:44:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm fading fast
2014-09-10 01:44:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I would stay up another 4 hours to talk to you if I could
2014-09-10 01:44:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. Goodnight!
2014-09-10 01:45:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet dreams, dearest
2014-09-10 09:48:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why do you think your social media presence diminished?
2014-09-10 10:35:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I rarely take pictures 
2014-09-10 10:35:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And when I do it takes forever to put them up
2014-09-10 10:36:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you used to post status updates fairly frequently, though
2014-09-10 10:36:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and what about tumblr?
2014-09-10 10:37:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like why aren't you posting about getting stoned or having sex
2014-09-10 10:38:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Because I'm not 21 anymore, I dunno. All the accounts I followed on tumblr stopped posting as much, and I just got bored with it as an outlet
2014-09-10 10:38:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It feels even more superficial than Facebook
2014-09-10 10:39:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the impulse to post those things just went away?
2014-09-10 10:39:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-10 10:39:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To post anything on tumblr
2014-09-10 10:40:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It requires a lot of scrolling through other peoples pictures (that all basically look the same after a while), and ain't nobody got time for that now 
2014-09-10 10:41:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the impulse is still there
2014-09-10 10:41:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tumblr just isn't the place to do it?
2014-09-10 10:42:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, I didn't say that
2014-09-10 10:43:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'm getting bored with social media. I don't care if everyone else knows I'm having a great time, I know I'm having a great time 
2014-09-10 10:43:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still use Instagram the same frequency 
2014-09-10 10:44:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also being in grad school, I might be a little more self conscious about the stuff I post. 
2014-09-10 10:44:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-09-10 10:45:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that seems like a pretty big change
2014-09-10 10:45:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you delete your Facebook for a whole?
2014-09-10 10:46:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*while
2014-09-10 10:46:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]deactivated it
2014-09-10 10:46:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]several times
2014-09-10 10:46:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why?
2014-09-10 10:47:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you post fairly frequently now
2014-09-10 10:47:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it's more than I used to.
2014-09-10 10:50:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well it's more than when it was deactivated I guess
2014-09-10 10:51:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK?
2014-09-10 10:51:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you getting at?
2014-09-10 10:51:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know what you're getting at
2014-09-10 10:51:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was saying that's a big change in your personality
2014-09-10 10:51:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from posting everything you're doing
2014-09-10 10:52:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and talking about how much you're getting laid
2014-09-10 10:52:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and doing drugs
2014-09-10 10:52:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and having a good time
2014-09-10 10:52:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to an anonymous or non audience
2014-09-10 10:52:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to virtually zero presence
2014-09-10 10:52:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or very low
2014-09-10 10:53:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did a post about doing drugs when I went to Miami 
2014-09-10 10:53:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on what/
2014-09-10 10:54:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Doses and mimosas 
2014-09-10 10:54:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A song
2014-09-10 10:54:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]About doing acid and drinking mimosas
2014-09-10 10:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-09-10 10:55:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're so interrogational sometimes in the morning 
2014-09-10 10:56:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also I posted like 3 things referring to sex over a 2 year period on there 
2014-09-10 10:56:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's hardly a lot
2014-09-10 10:56:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-10 10:56:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can drop it
2014-09-10 11:05:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone went through my Facebook history after we 1st met.... :)
2014-09-10 11:07:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the post was like four down when you friended me.
2014-09-10 11:07:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*that
2014-09-10 11:08:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was more like why did this chick just friend me on Facebook.
2014-09-10 11:20:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why did you friend me on Facebook?
2014-09-10 11:26:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you were cute and wanted to stalk your pictures to figure out what you looked like without a beard
2014-09-10 11:26:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We had a couple of interesting conversations
2014-09-10 11:27:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Something like that
2014-09-10 11:28:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-09-10 11:37:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#pheromones
2014-09-10 11:37:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In response to my recent fb post?
2014-09-10 11:38:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no, you Facebook friending me
2014-09-10 11:38:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I drew you in with my man scent
2014-09-10 11:38:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had you hooked already and you didn't even know it
2014-09-10 11:38:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hadn't even got that close to you at that point
2014-09-10 11:39:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except in a pool, which probably negates the power of pheromones
2014-09-10 11:39:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha was that before we had sat next to each other at the restaurant?
2014-09-10 11:39:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](oh yeah you don't remember)
2014-09-10 11:39:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-09-10 11:40:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What day did I friend you?
2014-09-10 11:40:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well we can't check now because you unfriended me
2014-09-10 11:40:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really? It doesn't show a friending history?
2014-09-10 11:42:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we met Saturday?
2014-09-10 11:42:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so probably friended that day?
2014-09-10 11:42:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let me see
2014-09-10 11:42:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you liked one of my posts early on
2014-09-10 11:42:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I friended you after the hot tub
2014-09-10 11:43:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe Sunday?
2014-09-10 11:43:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe
2014-09-10 11:43:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you totally objectified me
2014-09-10 11:44:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did not
2014-09-10 11:44:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We talked about stuff in the hot tub 
2014-09-10 11:44:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like music we like or something 
2014-09-10 11:44:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I think you brought up you had majored in music
2014-09-10 11:44:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I was struck
2014-09-10 11:45:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]January 6th
2014-09-10 11:45:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it does show up on Facebook
2014-09-10 11:45:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.facebook.com/michael.a.alcorn/posts/10101863173626981:0
2014-09-10 11:45:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just liked it, lol
2014-09-10 11:46:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dork
2014-09-10 11:48:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my mom can definitely see that post by the way
2014-09-10 11:48:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not that I care
2014-09-10 11:48:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just a heads up
2014-09-10 11:48:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should say all of my friends can see it
2014-09-10 11:48:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but again
2014-09-10 11:48:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't care
2014-09-10 11:48:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I set it so that only my friends can see it
2014-09-10 11:49:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless you decided to put it on your wall
2014-09-10 11:49:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-09-10 11:49:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't have a filter on
2014-09-10 11:49:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made it so your grandma can't see it on my page
2014-09-10 11:50:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-09-10 11:50:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she can't see it on my page either
2014-09-10 11:50:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but my mom can?
2014-09-10 11:50:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my sister can't either
2014-09-10 11:50:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought your mom would like it?
2014-09-10 11:50:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not friends with your sister
2014-09-10 11:50:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oooh I see
2014-09-10 11:50:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Should I set it so your mom can't see it either????
2014-09-10 11:50:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no it's fine
2014-09-10 11:51:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the sex talk out in the open probably isn't her favorite thing
2014-09-10 11:51:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]being a Catholic
2014-09-10 11:51:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm not offended by it
2014-09-10 11:52:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I took her off
2014-09-10 11:52:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You made me paranoid
2014-09-10 11:52:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-10 11:52:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so did you select the people it was shared with?
2014-09-10 11:53:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Friends except.... Option
2014-09-10 11:53:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-09-10 11:53:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and moms and grandmas are the except?
2014-09-10 11:53:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And a couple random teachers
2014-09-10 11:53:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I left my mom on there
2014-09-10 11:54:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think she'd care that much except be confused by what a markov model is
2014-09-10 11:54:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah, it seems like she's more down with that stuff
2014-09-10 11:54:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was going to post that a while ago but censored myself due to sex
2014-09-10 11:54:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never talked about sex with my mom or dad in any capacity
2014-09-10 11:54:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-10 11:54:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually noticed the screenshot said 23m
2014-09-10 11:55:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you took it at the time I said it
2014-09-10 12:13:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You never had "the talk" with them?
2014-09-10 12:14:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope
2014-09-10 12:14:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You obviously did?
2014-09-10 12:15:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like we've talked about this
2014-09-10 12:15:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably
2014-09-10 12:15:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And how my talks were very much "please don't do it"
2014-09-10 12:16:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess I knew that part of it
2014-09-10 12:18:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but as soon as you went to college that changed
2014-09-10 12:20:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-10 13:03:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Man today has been a lazy day
2014-09-10 13:04:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's not so bad
2014-09-10 13:04:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://github.com/airalcorn2/Sexy-Time-Markov-Model
2014-09-10 13:04:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should test this for me
2014-09-10 13:06:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you should change "pussy eating" to something slightly less vulgar
2014-09-10 13:06:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-10 13:07:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll use all technical terms
2014-09-10 13:07:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, better idea
2014-09-10 13:08:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I better delete this repo then
2014-09-10 13:08:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll create another one
2014-09-10 13:08:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh but I have had an orgasm while giving you a blow job!
2014-09-10 13:08:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I thought about that
2014-09-10 13:08:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You were fingering me, but still
2014-09-10 13:08:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it was because I was fingering you simultaneously
2014-09-10 13:08:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-10 13:09:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was a pretty sexy moment
2014-09-10 13:09:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have to admit
2014-09-10 13:10:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well we haven't considered hand action in here at all , so I think that should still count as a low probability for me to have an orgasm while giving you a blow job
2014-09-10 13:11:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]these aren't supposed to represent "us" remember
2014-09-10 13:11:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-10 13:11:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmph
2014-09-10 13:11:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'll add a little prob
2014-09-10 13:14:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhhhhh I want to have sex with you right now
2014-09-10 13:14:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would be very nice
2014-09-10 13:15:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to push your head down really deep on my cock
2014-09-10 13:15:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This line of thought will not lead me to become anymore productive lol 
2014-09-10 13:16:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw I'm sorry
2014-09-10 13:16:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I would really like a hard quickie bent over the couch 
2014-09-10 13:17:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mmm yummy
2014-09-10 13:17:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]get you one of those times between class
2014-09-10 13:17:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't even take your clothes off
2014-09-10 13:17:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmm hmm
2014-09-10 13:17:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just pull your pants down, bend you over, and start fucking you
2014-09-10 13:18:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a few hard spanks
2014-09-10 13:18:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Damn it!
2014-09-10 13:19:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now my pussy is all wet and I just got to campus 
2014-09-10 13:20:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mmm
2014-09-10 13:20:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wish I could be there to fuck you in your office
2014-09-10 13:20:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with you straddling me in your chair
2014-09-10 13:21:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can make that happen during one of your visits
2014-09-10 13:22:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be fun    😃 
2014-09-10 13:23:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://github.com/airalcorn2/Sexy-Time-Markov-Model
2014-09-10 13:23:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You should see if you can run it following my instructions.
2014-09-10 13:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I am achinggg for your pussy now
2014-09-10 13:49:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Had to set something up in the lab, but I'll check it now
2014-09-10 13:50:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my pussy is very much aching for you to fill it up
2014-09-10 14:08:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It works!
2014-09-10 14:08:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha awesome
2014-09-10 14:08:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]is time in seconds?
2014-09-10 14:08:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-09-10 14:09:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]aw you can format it to look cleaner than that
2014-09-10 14:09:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how should I format it?
2014-09-10 14:10:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]to give the answer in minutes and secconds
2014-09-10 14:10:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the files should have instructions for what they are
2014-09-10 14:11:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like "Transition Probabilities" might not make intuitive sense to everyone
2014-09-10 14:11:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok, so output the times in minutes and second
2014-09-10 14:11:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and add descriptions of the files to the README?
2014-09-10 14:11:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I like the snarky "You know... if you're into being fair"
2014-09-10 14:12:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes
2014-09-10 14:13:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What about a 3some?
2014-09-10 14:13:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]this could be relatively easily changed for 3 partners
2014-09-10 14:14:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-10 14:14:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]although I guess I could make the code more generic
2014-09-10 14:14:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to allow for any number of partners
2014-09-10 14:14:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm, are orgasms additive?
2014-09-10 14:14:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-09-10 14:15:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like each position has an orgasm per second probability, right?
2014-09-10 14:16:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's a rate
2014-09-10 14:16:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yes
2014-09-10 14:17:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hmmm
2014-09-10 14:17:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and so you accrue "partial orgasms" throughout each position
2014-09-10 14:17:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-10 14:18:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what is happening if you look at the output
2014-09-10 14:18:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know I'm looking at the output
2014-09-10 14:18:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but my original question was, is this biologically realistic?
2014-09-10 14:18:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do orgasms accrue like that?
2014-09-10 14:18:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-10 14:18:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but certain things bring you to orgasm faster than others
2014-09-10 14:19:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe it should be probability of having an orgasm in each position as a function of how long you've been having sex
2014-09-10 14:19:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]with parameters for typical time to orgasm for each partner
2014-09-10 14:20:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or like a distriution of times
2014-09-10 14:20:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*distribution
2014-09-10 14:21:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that makes sense
2014-09-10 14:21:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd have to think of how to represent that
2014-09-10 14:21:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so each partner has a probability distribution of having an orgasm
2014-09-10 14:21:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-09-10 14:21:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-09-10 14:21:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]using "time" as a parameter doesn't really make sense
2014-09-10 14:22:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'd want "arousal"
2014-09-10 14:22:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you would want
2014-09-10 14:23:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess
2014-09-10 14:23:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"arousal"
2014-09-10 14:23:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and "time spent in current position"
2014-09-10 14:23:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's basically what I'm trying to simulate
2014-09-10 14:23:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with orgasms per second
2014-09-10 14:23:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's why I did it the way I did
2014-09-10 14:23:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so a position that makes you cum faster
2014-09-10 14:23:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]will make your orgasms closer to one
2014-09-10 14:24:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and so even if you switch to a position that isn't as arousing
2014-09-10 14:24:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can still cum quickly
2014-09-10 14:24:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you had been in a more arousing position for a while
2014-09-10 14:24:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]thhat's not how it works for me most of the time though
2014-09-10 14:24:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your arousal doesn't build?
2014-09-10 14:25:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess, but not as a function of different positions
2014-09-10 14:25:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]different positions don't make you cum faster?
2014-09-10 14:25:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's how long I've been stimulated, and then certain positions almost always make me cum
2014-09-10 14:26:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes, but if we were doing doggy style and I'm really close to cumming and you switched me over to something else I wouldn't automatically finish
2014-09-10 14:26:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the actual orgasm is more a function of what position I'm in at the time
2014-09-10 14:26:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and how long I've been stimulated
2014-09-10 14:26:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you wouldn't be closer to finishing
2014-09-10 14:27:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if we switched positions
2014-09-10 14:27:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like it would take the same amount of time in missionary
2014-09-10 14:27:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if we went ten minutes in missionary
2014-09-10 14:27:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as opposed to eight in doggy style
2014-09-10 14:27:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in which you get close to orgasm
2014-09-10 14:27:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and two in missionary
2014-09-10 14:27:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no I guess not
2014-09-10 14:27:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you guess not to what
2014-09-10 14:28:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I don't know what you'e asking actually
2014-09-10 14:28:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're having sex
2014-09-10 14:28:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm behind you
2014-09-10 14:28:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you get close to cumming
2014-09-10 14:28:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]back up
2014-09-10 14:28:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm behind you for eight minutes
2014-09-10 14:28:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you get close to cumming
2014-09-10 14:28:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I roll you over
2014-09-10 14:29:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we go til you finish
2014-09-10 14:29:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's scenario a
2014-09-10 14:29:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]scenario b
2014-09-10 14:29:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we have sex in missionary until you cum
2014-09-10 14:29:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would you require the same amount of time in missionary to cum
2014-09-10 14:30:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]10 minutes total vs 10 minutes in missionary?
2014-09-10 14:30:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe?
2014-09-10 14:31:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you would take ten more minutes in missionary
2014-09-10 14:31:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]after we had sex for eight minutes in doggy style
2014-09-10 14:31:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no
2014-09-10 14:31:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's why is a function of how long total you've been having sex as well!
2014-09-10 14:32:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]not how long I'm stimulated in each position
2014-09-10 14:32:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but how long I've been stimulated across all positions we've done
2014-09-10 14:32:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't understand why you think the way it is now is not a good approximation of that
2014-09-10 14:32:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]exactly
2014-09-10 14:32:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so, in the model
2014-09-10 14:32:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the simulator starts out in doggy style
2014-09-10 14:32:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'll add up your orgasms/second
2014-09-10 14:33:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and when we switch to another position
2014-09-10 14:33:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]1) orgasm rates are a lot harder to estimate than probability of orgasm in each position
2014-09-10 14:33:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it has that number still
2014-09-10 14:33:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like you just pulled these rates out of your ass
2014-09-10 14:33:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how would you estimate probability, hon
2014-09-10 14:33:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probability of having an orgasm given the amount of time spent in the position
2014-09-10 14:33:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I count how many orgasms I've had in each position
2014-09-10 14:34:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]divided by the number of times I've had sex
2014-09-10 14:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that does not account for arousal
2014-09-10 14:34:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which you just verified makes a difference
2014-09-10 14:34:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so basically
2014-09-10 14:34:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're saying
2014-09-10 14:34:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the model
2014-09-10 14:34:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you didn't cum in doggy style
2014-09-10 14:34:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we switched to missionary
2014-09-10 14:34:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would essentially reset
2014-09-10 14:35:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or you want to treat all sex before the current position as equivalent
2014-09-10 14:35:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you could be giving me head for ten minutes
2014-09-10 14:35:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and instantly cum
2014-09-10 14:35:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok
2014-09-10 14:36:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]arousal can increase for each person in a rate
2014-09-10 14:36:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the distribution you want is p(orgasm | position, time spent in position, time having sex up to this position)
2014-09-10 14:36:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]for each position
2014-09-10 14:37:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but maybe an "if arousal is >= func(prob of orgasm in new position, time spent having sex)"
2014-09-10 14:37:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]then partner has an orgasm
2014-09-10 14:38:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd have to think about the function
2014-09-10 14:38:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but then, you end up with integers for orgasms per person and some left over arousal factor
2014-09-10 14:38:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you need time in position as well
2014-09-10 14:39:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what you want right?
2014-09-10 14:39:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]integer number of orgasms?
2014-09-10 14:39:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That way, people who are totally not aroused by blow jobs don't increase in arousal
2014-09-10 14:39:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but people who are, can
2014-09-10 14:40:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so I give you a blow job for 10 minutes, I'm turned on, you go down on me for a minute and I cum
2014-09-10 14:40:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we each get 1 orgasm
2014-09-10 14:40:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I'm probably not going to cum while going don on you
2014-09-10 14:40:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-09-10 14:41:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]arousal is determined by time in each position
2014-09-10 14:41:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sorry hangouts isn't updating your comments in real time
2014-09-10 14:42:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh bummer
2014-09-10 14:44:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I guess we need an arousal function
2014-09-10 14:44:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and what can arousal range from?
2014-09-10 14:45:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and once you have this arousal number
2014-09-10 14:45:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that is additive I guess?
2014-09-10 14:45:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-10 14:45:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So arousal is just like your orgasms/sec
2014-09-10 14:45:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except not really
2014-09-10 14:45:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we just need an arousal threshold
2014-09-10 14:46:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe just 1.0 can be the threshold
2014-09-10 14:46:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-10 14:46:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and if arousal is > 1
2014-09-10 14:46:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]orgasm is possible
2014-09-10 14:46:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess?
2014-09-10 14:46:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm
2014-09-10 14:47:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can arousal reset to a certain level after an orgasm
2014-09-10 14:47:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-10 14:47:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd have to go back to zero for dudes
2014-09-10 14:47:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like for me, it resets to .7 because I can cum again soon.
2014-09-10 14:47:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-10 14:47:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or even negative
2014-09-10 14:48:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or maybe .2 if someone has a fast turn around
2014-09-10 14:48:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right it's tunable
2014-09-10 14:48:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If arousal equals 1, then you have an orgasm no matter what position you're in 
2014-09-10 14:49:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-09-10 14:49:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that basically just gets back to the way I have it
2014-09-10 14:49:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But if you have a high probability of cumming in a certain position, you need less of an arousal to cum
2014-09-10 14:50:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yours does not give discrete orgasm numbers per person
2014-09-10 14:50:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I could just take the floor
2014-09-10 14:51:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No this gives more realistic information! And it allows the user to put in values they can more easily estimate
2014-09-10 14:51:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't understand how it's easier to estimate
2014-09-10 14:51:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like, what positions arouse me more and what positions make me cum easier 
2014-09-10 14:51:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We have no idea our orgasm rate per second 
2014-09-10 14:51:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it doesn't exist
2014-09-10 14:52:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's a proxy
2014-09-10 14:52:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly
2014-09-10 14:52:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I bet people can guess which position the cum in what percent of the time
2014-09-10 14:52:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you know your probability distribution for different positions, arousal, and time spent in positoin?
2014-09-10 14:53:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even better
2014-09-10 14:53:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you know how to represent this "arousal" number accurately
2014-09-10 14:53:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-09-10 14:53:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should provide me with some data
2014-09-10 14:54:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha k I will
2014-09-10 14:54:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or I'll just take some time and write it myself the way I want it
2014-09-10 16:46:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]OK!
2014-09-10 16:47:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I couldn't figure out one part
2014-09-10 16:49:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I didn't include anything with the probability of orgasm based ourely on position
2014-09-10 16:49:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]because that's comes to play in the arousal rate
2014-09-10 16:50:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I think this is a little bit more realistic as far as the "Reset" level between orgasms
2014-09-10 16:51:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not very different from yours
2014-09-10 17:05:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah it's not. The only difference is the arousal max, which I'm not sure makes a difference.
2014-09-10 17:05:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the resets!
2014-09-10 17:05:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The orgasm probability was the tricky part.
2014-09-10 17:06:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The resets are essentially accounted for in mine.
2014-09-10 17:06:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not really except for you
2014-09-10 17:06:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because arousal is additive in my model.
2014-09-10 17:07:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The arousal max allows someone to get pleasure from a position but not likely to cum no matter how long you stay in it 
2014-09-10 17:07:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's more realistic
2014-09-10 17:08:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Right, but if you never reach that max it doesn't matter.
2014-09-10 17:08:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, how aroused do you get from eating me out?
2014-09-10 17:08:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On a scale of 1 to 10?
2014-09-10 17:09:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What does that scale represent lol
2014-09-10 17:09:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]10 being an orgasm, 1 being totally flaccid and thinking about sports
2014-09-10 17:09:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What is an erection that isn't being physically stimulated?
2014-09-10 17:10:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess that's up to you
2014-09-10 17:10:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't answer that for you lol
2014-09-10 17:11:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There are like four states then, not ten.
2014-09-10 17:11:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Flaccid, erect, being stimulated, and cumming.
2014-09-10 17:12:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're making out with someone for like 30 minutes and there's a lot if tit and ass grabbing
2014-09-10 17:12:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you going to be more turned on than if you just got a boner from looking at a sexy picture?
2014-09-10 17:13:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess. There's no penis stimulation?
2014-09-10 17:14:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No. For me, I would definitely be closer to orgasm from that even in I wasn't directly being stimulated 
2014-09-10 17:14:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-09-10 17:15:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But what if you reach your 0.1 arousal from eating me out in like a minute
2014-09-10 17:15:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the rest is just you raising my arousal
2014-09-10 17:15:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's fine.
2014-09-10 17:16:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why would something have a high arousal rate and a low max?
2014-09-10 17:16:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The arousing element is just doing it in the first place
2014-09-10 17:17:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It asymptotes almost mediately
2014-09-10 17:17:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't get more pleasure the longer you eat me out. Or do you?
2014-09-10 17:17:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like it when you cum.
2014-09-10 17:18:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. Your model has a lot more uncertainty.
2014-09-10 17:18:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]More complexity.
2014-09-10 17:19:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My model only has one parameter to estimate... "arousalRate"
2014-09-10 17:21:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This allows for more generalization to couples who are very one sided in how they enjoy different positions
2014-09-10 17:22:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone enjoys doggy style, but has never cum from it, whereas the partner always cums from it
2014-09-10 17:22:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like gay men couples
2014-09-10 17:23:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But there's still arousal in the receiving end
2014-09-10 17:36:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but how do you quantify what you're describing?
2014-09-10 17:37:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]everything in my model could be quantified
2014-09-10 17:37:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You should try my updated version.
2014-09-10 17:37:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We make a descriptive scale from 0 to 10 of level of arousal I guess
2014-09-10 17:38:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and use self-reporting?
2014-09-10 17:38:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-10 17:38:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh noooooo
2014-09-10 17:38:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-09-10 17:38:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-09-10 17:38:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Making fun of you
2014-09-10 17:38:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz I'm not down with that?
2014-09-10 17:39:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-10 17:39:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty sure my model would be more accurate.
2014-09-10 17:40:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's only one way to find out
2014-09-10 17:40:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]human sex experiments
2014-09-10 17:40:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly
2014-09-10 17:41:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]self-reporting basically introduces a whole extra element of uncertainty, though
2014-09-10 17:41:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as two 7s are not going to be equivalent
2014-09-10 17:41:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and max arousal will be impossible to get accurate numbers for
2014-09-10 17:41:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What is the goal of this model?
2014-09-10 17:42:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]simulate sex
2014-09-10 17:43:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well could you use a comparison of the two models to estimate arousal max or reset?
2014-09-10 17:45:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like reset is pretty variable
2014-09-10 17:48:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]did you change orgasms to be integers?
2014-09-10 17:48:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just took the floor like I said I could
2014-09-10 17:49:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think sex lasts longer on average in the model than it does in real life
2014-09-10 17:49:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think it does a pretty good job otherwise
2014-09-10 17:50:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and our transition probabilities are not realistic to us
2014-09-10 17:50:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah?
2014-09-10 17:50:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we don't change positions that much everytime
2014-09-10 17:50:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]not even half the time
2014-09-10 17:50:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we usually only do one?
2014-09-10 17:51:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like 30%+ of the time we do
2014-09-10 17:52:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the median is probably two in the current model
2014-09-10 17:52:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which isn't a bad estimate
2014-09-10 17:52:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh
2014-09-10 17:52:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]did you just guess that?
2014-09-10 17:52:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-10 17:52:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just running a bunch of simulations
2014-09-10 17:53:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like two posp up the most
2014-09-10 17:53:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's scientific
2014-09-10 17:53:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-09-10 17:53:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could automate the process if you want me to
2014-09-10 17:54:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]7 simulations
2014-09-10 17:54:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]# positions
2014-09-10 17:54:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1, 4, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1, 4
2014-09-10 17:55:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still think there should be a reset
2014-09-10 17:55:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]because when I have an orgasm I don't just go back to 0 arousal
2014-09-10 17:55:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it takes less time and less stimulation
2014-09-10 17:55:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]to get to the 2nd and 3rd ect
2014-09-10 17:58:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean how much worse is my additive thing?
2014-09-10 17:58:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so in my simulation
2014-09-10 17:59:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it assigns an amount of sex
2014-09-10 17:59:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]an amount of time
2014-09-10 17:59:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to a position
2014-09-10 17:59:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then it adds that number to the arousal
2014-09-10 17:59:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or # orgasms
2014-09-10 17:59:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you can just think of it as
2014-09-10 17:59:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you orgasmed
2014-09-10 17:59:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at the integer
2014-09-10 18:00:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the extra bit
2014-09-10 18:00:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is your "reset"
2014-09-10 18:00:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in that instance
2014-09-10 18:00:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and since reset is probably pretty variable
2014-09-10 18:00:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the different "resets" being simulated in this model will capture the randomness of reality
2014-09-10 18:02:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How many orgasms does it usually give me?
2014-09-10 18:02:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for that same stretch mentioned above
2014-09-10 18:02:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1, 2, 1, 3, 1, 3, 1, 1
2014-09-10 18:03:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should look at 100
2014-09-10 18:03:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Make me some histograms!
2014-09-10 18:03:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-10 18:03:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-10 18:11:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-10 18:11:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]got an 11 position one
2014-09-10 18:11:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty silly 
2014-09-10 18:12:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]averages
2014-09-10 18:12:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]11 minutes
2014-09-10 18:12:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2.77 positions
2014-09-10 18:12:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have 1.86 orgasms
2014-09-10 18:12:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have 1.2
2014-09-10 18:12:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not bad
2014-09-10 18:13:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]median number of positoins
2014-09-10 18:13:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2
2014-09-10 18:13:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]orgasms for you
2014-09-10 18:13:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2
2014-09-10 18:13:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me
2014-09-10 18:13:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1
2014-09-10 18:14:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How do you have 2 orgasms in some cases
2014-09-10 18:14:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]quick recovery
2014-09-10 18:14:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you had it cut off when you went over 1
2014-09-10 18:14:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do
2014-09-10 18:14:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if I was at like 0.9
2014-09-10 18:14:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then we go into missionary for 8 minutes
2014-09-10 18:14:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll get two
2014-09-10 18:15:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I only had one orgasm on the 11 position one
2014-09-10 18:15:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you had three
2014-09-10 18:15:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-10 18:15:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need to find that one
2014-09-10 18:15:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you just keep eating me out?
2014-09-10 18:16:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude here's a case where the limit would help
2014-09-10 18:16:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even if that limit is 1 for everything
2014-09-10 18:16:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-10 18:16:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know what it is
2014-09-10 18:16:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I sample from a normal distribution
2014-09-10 18:16:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with a certain mean and standard deviation
2014-09-10 18:17:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it looks like I occasionally get negative times
2014-09-10 18:17:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we spent -210 seconds in missinoary
2014-09-10 18:17:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]-37.73 in missionary
2014-09-10 18:17:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]-133.41 in missionary
2014-09-10 18:17:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and those also drive down my orgasm count
2014-09-10 18:18:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so instead of going from 0.0 to 1.0
2014-09-10 18:18:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm having sex with you on MDMA
2014-09-10 18:18:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-09-10 18:18:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the Standard deviation is way too big it looks like
2014-09-10 18:19:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-10 18:19:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]two standard deviations and you're negative
2014-09-10 18:21:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's fixed
2014-09-10 18:25:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to go for a run
2014-09-10 18:26:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-10 18:26:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't believe I wasted my afternoon talking to you about this lol
2014-09-10 18:26:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's kind of funny
2014-09-10 18:26:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]harsh
2014-09-10 18:30:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't mean it to be
2014-09-10 18:30:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just didn't get any work done
2014-09-10 19:37:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It wasn't a waste of an afternoon
2014-09-10 19:37:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might've been a little pissy that you didn't like any of my modifications lol
2014-09-10 19:39:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not that I didn't like them
2014-09-10 19:39:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're great in theory
2014-09-10 19:39:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's all I was saying
2014-09-10 19:40:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they would be really difficult to quantify
2014-09-10 19:40:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it doesn't matter
2014-09-10 19:40:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because the model isn't gonna be used
2014-09-10 19:40:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we're not gonna get accurate numbers for any of the parameters
2014-09-10 19:41:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought we agreed one day when we lived together we'd film ourselves having sex for a month?
2014-09-10 19:41:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-10 19:41:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can still do that
2014-09-10 19:41:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then we can test the model on real data
2014-09-10 19:41:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but we wouldn't get the orgasmsPerSecond parameter
2014-09-10 19:42:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'd need like a lot of "trials" to get those numbers
2014-09-10 19:42:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just filming ourselves having sex would be good for the initial probs and transition probs
2014-09-10 19:42:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but wouldn't give us anything meaningful for the orgasmRate
2014-09-10 19:43:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would give us time parameters too I suppose
2014-09-10 19:43:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yeah
2014-09-10 19:43:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the arousalRate or whatever
2014-09-10 19:43:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]orgasmsPerSecond
2014-09-10 19:43:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we would need to have sex in one position
2014-09-10 19:43:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]several times
2014-09-10 19:43:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and time how long it took us to orgasm
2014-09-10 19:43:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes!
2014-09-10 19:43:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then take the average of that I suppose
2014-09-10 19:44:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you want to do that?
2014-09-10 19:44:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well that would be a way to quantify that parameter
2014-09-10 19:44:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or how about this
2014-09-10 19:44:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that would mean we have a lot of "boring" sex
2014-09-10 19:44:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We do the position for up to 15 minutes
2014-09-10 19:45:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]15 minutes?
2014-09-10 19:45:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how long do you think we usually last
2014-09-10 19:45:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-10 19:45:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if you don't cum, you give a "score" for how stimulated you are
2014-09-10 19:45:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That way, if you never cum from a position in 15 min, then we know the maximum arousal
2014-09-10 19:46:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll cum in any position
2014-09-10 19:46:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if we haven't already had sex that day
2014-09-10 19:46:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Including eating me out
2014-09-10 19:46:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I think we should be using as our baseline
2014-09-10 19:46:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well no
2014-09-10 19:46:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if that's the only one
2014-09-10 19:46:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then why have it?
2014-09-10 19:47:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Its the same for when I go down on you
2014-09-10 19:48:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What if we could graph changing levels of arousal during the simulated sex
2014-09-10 19:48:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like per second?
2014-09-10 19:48:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It shouldn't be a flat line for when I go down on you
2014-09-10 19:48:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-10 19:49:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well exactly, it's not a flat line
2014-09-10 19:49:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but there's a max you're saying
2014-09-10 19:49:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess tell me how you'd quantify all this stuff
2014-09-10 19:49:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we've gotta bunch of videos of us having sex
2014-09-10 19:49:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just did
2014-09-10 19:49:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're naked
2014-09-10 19:50:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]watching them
2014-09-10 19:50:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with our hands on the other persons privates
2014-09-10 19:50:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what numbers am I recording with my free hand
2014-09-10 19:50:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-09-10 19:50:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can't analyze the videos until after the trials
2014-09-10 19:51:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't have an idea of what you'd be looking for?
2014-09-10 19:51:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or you just want all self-reporting
2014-09-10 19:51:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for max arousal
2014-09-10 19:51:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I guess arousal rate
2014-09-10 19:51:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We record time in each position, the order of positions
2014-09-10 19:51:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is different from orgasmsPerSecond
2014-09-10 19:51:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is my thing
2014-09-10 19:51:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And when each person has an orgasm
2014-09-10 19:52:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The arousal rate comes from the individual position trials
2014-09-10 19:52:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and how are you defining arousal rate then
2014-09-10 19:52:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Orgasm per second as you already memtioned
2014-09-10 19:53:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's different from arousal rate, though
2014-09-10 19:53:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if you don't cum, you give a rating for level of arousal
2014-09-10 19:53:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-10 19:53:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the rate is calculated a that level divided by the time
2014-09-10 19:53:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you.
2014-09-10 19:54:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think we're getting our ideas across right now.
2014-09-10 19:54:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or I'm having trouble comprehending your plan.
2014-09-10 19:54:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah i feel like I've said the same thing to you a couple times now
2014-09-10 19:55:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I understand your idea
2014-09-10 19:55:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you think there's an average max arousal
2014-09-10 19:55:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for different positions
2014-09-10 19:55:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where arousal of 1.0 equals orgasm
2014-09-10 19:56:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and while we're simulating sex
2014-09-10 19:56:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes, and most positions will equal one
2014-09-10 19:56:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the arousal rate should be allowed to increase until it reaches that point
2014-09-10 19:56:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-10 19:56:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]soo
2014-09-10 19:56:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the only real difference is for head and pussy eating
2014-09-10 19:56:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or you want some sort of reset attribute too?
2014-09-10 19:57:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you don't cum that often with me on top
2014-09-10 19:58:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok maybe we don't make a max, but if I finish a 10 minute blow job with at 3 level arousal
2014-09-10 19:58:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then the arousal rate will be .3/600
2014-09-10 19:59:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Instead of 0
2014-09-10 19:59:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-10 19:59:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that makes sense
2014-09-10 19:59:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]isn't that what I have already, though?
2014-09-10 20:00:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need to change my pussy eating from zero
2014-09-10 20:00:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but aren't those equivalent?
2014-09-10 20:00:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well now we know a way to quantify it from our data collection
2014-09-10 20:00:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, but we don't even really need to collect data for that
2014-09-10 20:01:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it's subjective
2014-09-10 20:01:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you could make a mental note of it as it's happening
2014-09-10 20:01:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-09-10 20:01:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's still tricky, though
2014-09-10 20:02:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because what if you give me head for 15 minutes?
2014-09-10 20:02:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or 5 minutes?
2014-09-10 20:02:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you're arousal is the same
2014-09-10 20:02:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a lot of variance
2014-09-10 20:02:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well then that agrees with my idea of a max!!!
2014-09-10 20:03:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If we do the trials, and I never go above a 5 for arousal
2014-09-10 20:03:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm
2014-09-10 20:04:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we can make a function for arousal that includes variance
2014-09-10 20:05:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-10 20:05:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm liking the sound of that
2014-09-10 20:05:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]arousal = f(time, position)
2014-09-10 20:05:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well no
2014-09-10 20:05:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And maybe if I give you a blowjob fir 15 minutes I get bored and start decreasing in arousal.....
2014-09-10 20:05:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because that's just back to the subjectivity
2014-09-10 20:06:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh there has to be some subjectivity if we want to actually model sex
2014-09-10 20:06:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-10 20:06:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If we just want orgasm output, we can stick with your oversimplified model
2014-09-10 20:07:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or else we stick monitors to our genitalia and get quantitative measures of arousal
2014-09-10 20:07:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that'd be ideal
2014-09-10 20:07:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's really just oral we need to figure out
2014-09-10 20:07:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm trying to think of a way
2014-09-10 20:07:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]of like
2014-09-10 20:08:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you suck me off
2014-09-10 20:08:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I finish
2014-09-10 20:08:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then we quickly do something to you
2014-09-10 20:08:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like use a vibrator
2014-09-10 20:08:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and see how long it takes
2014-09-10 20:08:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha 
2014-09-10 20:08:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and use that as a proxy
2014-09-10 20:08:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Actually thats not a terrible idea
2014-09-10 20:08:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then I eat you out
2014-09-10 20:09:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you suck me off after or whatever we want to use for that standard
2014-09-10 20:09:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it wouldn't directly translate
2014-09-10 20:09:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'd need to transform it somehow
2014-09-10 20:09:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How fast does it usually take for you ti jerk yourself off?
2014-09-10 20:10:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess I can finish pretty fast watching porn
2014-09-10 20:10:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not really trying to get myself off in these trials, though
2014-09-10 20:11:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think the speed you cum is a factor of how turned on you are when you start?
2014-09-10 20:11:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]jerking off?
2014-09-10 20:11:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-10 20:11:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm I don't know
2014-09-10 20:11:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt it
2014-09-10 20:11:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really start turned on I guess
2014-09-10 20:11:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I pretty much know what feels good
2014-09-10 20:12:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually have to pace myself
2014-09-10 20:12:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-10 20:12:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well what sex act do you think level of arousal influences time to cum?
2014-09-10 20:12:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In particular
2014-09-10 20:13:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one more time
2014-09-10 20:13:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh
2014-09-10 20:13:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-10 20:13:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]umm
2014-09-10 20:13:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess any of them?
2014-09-10 20:13:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like when we're having sex?
2014-09-10 20:13:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just trying ti figure out a standard
2014-09-10 20:14:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It doesn't matter
2014-09-10 20:14:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-10 20:15:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'll get the BJ thing figured out and use that
2014-09-10 20:15:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:/
2014-09-10 20:15:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ughhh
2014-09-10 20:15:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't be self-conscious about it
2014-09-10 20:16:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I can't help it!
2014-09-10 20:17:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm telling you there are times that I can tell if you kept doing exactly what you were doing it would make me cum in like 30 seconds
2014-09-10 20:17:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't want that to happen every time you give me head, obviously
2014-09-10 20:17:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if we could pin that down
2014-09-10 20:18:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then you could sort of explore other things but know what to come back to essentially
2014-09-10 20:18:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know I know
2014-09-10 20:19:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like that was all really poorly handled on my part
2014-09-10 20:19:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm still struggling with how to talk to you about it
2014-09-10 20:22:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No no no
2014-09-10 20:22:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The way you just put it is fine
2014-09-10 20:22:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-10 20:22:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is the one aspect of our relationship that makes me really uneasy
2014-09-10 20:22:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]/uncomfortable
2014-09-10 20:22:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well the first way you brought it us was a little whack
2014-09-10 20:23:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*up
2014-09-10 20:23:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I don't want you to feel uneasy talking about it!
2014-09-10 20:24:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just know it bums you out and it's frustrating that we're trying to figure it out and struggling
2014-09-10 20:24:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when everything else clicks so easily
2014-09-10 20:25:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it that bad that you have to label it as struggling?
2014-09-10 20:26:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's something we're going to talk about and do a little sexy lesson in person and it's going to be fine
2014-09-10 20:26:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-10 20:27:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But maybe don't make it as "something we need to figure out and are struggling with". That's not helping with the pressure lol
2014-09-10 20:28:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's no pressure
2014-09-10 20:28:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we need to just do it
2014-09-10 20:28:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and talk
2014-09-10 20:28:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and have fun while we're doing it
2014-09-10 20:28:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you tell me what you think I'm feeling
2014-09-10 20:28:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-10 20:28:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and how you like what you're doing
2014-09-10 20:28:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and just make jokes
2014-09-10 20:29:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and feel good
2014-09-10 20:29:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and love each other
2014-09-10 20:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and no pressure
2014-09-10 20:29:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha got it
2014-09-10 20:29:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No pressure
2014-09-10 20:30:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Giggle while you're dick is in my mouth
2014-09-10 20:30:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-09-10 20:30:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be pretty sexy
2014-09-10 20:31:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-09-10 20:31:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too
2014-09-10 20:32:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's save the sex trials for a much later date though
2014-09-10 20:32:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]agreed
2014-09-10 20:32:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to flip you over whenever I want
2014-09-10 20:32:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I want you getting on top of me whenever you want
2014-09-10 20:33:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yesss
2014-09-10 20:33:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might be a good way to keep our weekly average up when we drift out of the honeymoon phase
2014-09-10 20:34:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-09-10 20:34:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*if we drift
2014-09-10 20:34:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's our weekly average right now?
2014-09-10 20:34:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like 2?
2014-09-10 20:34:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]5
2014-09-10 20:34:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for real
2014-09-10 20:34:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For the length of our relationship
2014-09-10 20:35:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-10 20:35:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we did talk about taht
2014-09-10 20:35:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's really impressive
2014-09-10 20:35:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is
2014-09-10 20:35:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might've bragged a little about it at wine night 
2014-09-10 20:35:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]!!!
2014-09-10 20:35:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha the topic came up through someone else!
2014-09-10 20:36:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ooh man
2014-09-10 20:36:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was it just a number?
2014-09-10 20:36:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone had told Haley they prefer to have sex 2 times a day
2014-09-10 20:37:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which Haley though was ridiculous and a lie
2014-09-10 20:37:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as opposed to what
2014-09-10 20:37:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As opposed to any less than that I guess. So I gave her our stats
2014-09-10 20:37:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Saying it's totally possible 
2014-09-10 20:37:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haaa
2014-09-10 20:37:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you mention the multiple sixers?
2014-09-10 20:38:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I didn't!
2014-09-10 20:38:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll have to tell her next time I see her
2014-09-10 20:38:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh man... that's where the real bragging is
2014-09-10 20:38:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's the most orgasms you've had in a 24 hour stretch?
2014-09-10 20:38:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you not like me talking about our sex life to friends?
2014-09-10 20:38:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh no
2014-09-10 20:39:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't mind
2014-09-10 20:39:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just curious how much your friends know about me
2014-09-10 20:39:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm I don't know, I'd guess like 9?
2014-09-10 20:39:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with me?
2014-09-10 20:39:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of course. I can give myself like 4 in a 90 minute master bating sesh
2014-09-10 20:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no shit
2014-09-10 20:40:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah but any vibrator stimulation after that and it kind of hurts  
2014-09-10 20:40:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like my clit gets sore 
2014-09-10 20:40:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can imagine
2014-09-10 20:41:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe 8 in 24 hours is my max
2014-09-10 20:41:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you have a time in mind?
2014-09-10 20:42:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The time we hit 6 at your Raleigh apt 
2014-09-10 20:42:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When like 3 of those were really close together 
2014-09-10 20:42:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-10 20:43:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't wait
2014-09-10 20:43:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know I love you for a million and one things
2014-09-10 20:43:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But goddamn do I love the orgasms you give me
2014-09-10 20:44:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-09-10 20:44:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love giving them to you
2014-09-10 20:44:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love watching you cum
2014-09-10 20:44:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and hearing you
2014-09-10 20:45:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the way you squeeze me
2014-09-10 20:45:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I love the way you make me cum, obviously
2014-09-10 20:45:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love how into it you are
2014-09-10 20:45:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you always really focus on my face
2014-09-10 20:45:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when I'm about to cum
2014-09-10 20:45:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you cum?
2014-09-10 20:46:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-10 20:46:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's such a rush experiencing you cumming inside of me
2014-09-10 20:46:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-10 20:46:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's really sexy
2014-09-10 20:47:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]everything about your body language and face is like encouraging me... like you can't wait for it to happen
2014-09-10 20:47:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's super sexy how much you want it
2014-09-10 20:48:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want it nowwww
2014-09-10 20:48:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me toooo
2014-09-10 20:48:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man
2014-09-10 20:49:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]finishing inside you and just collapsing on you afterwards is such a good feeling
2014-09-10 20:49:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I love how you always get sad when I eventually come out of you
2014-09-10 20:49:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like how you stay for a bit, and cuddle afterwards still inside of me
2014-09-10 20:49:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love it actually
2014-09-10 20:50:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃  I can tell 
2014-09-10 20:52:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We might have to include sexy talk in our model
2014-09-10 20:52:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we don't really do it much!
2014-09-10 20:53:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And quantify how soon I can cum after a conversation of certain length
2014-09-10 20:53:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've been thinking about talking more, though
2014-09-10 20:53:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not in person I guess
2014-09-10 20:53:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah?
2014-09-10 20:53:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooh ok
2014-09-10 20:53:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-10 20:53:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I forget what I said last time we were together
2014-09-10 20:53:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said your name, though
2014-09-10 20:53:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like "Katie, you feel so good"
2014-09-10 20:53:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or something like that
2014-09-10 20:53:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I was pretty into it
2014-09-10 20:54:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I told you I never used names before
2014-09-10 20:54:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did it feel natural?
2014-09-10 20:54:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah!
2014-09-10 20:54:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it actually felt way more natural than when I use your names in other contexts
2014-09-10 20:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-10 20:54:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's interesting 
2014-09-10 20:55:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but other stuff too
2014-09-10 20:55:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like just asking if you like it
2014-09-10 20:55:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and maybe saying how sexy you are and stuff
2014-09-10 20:55:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I dunno!
2014-09-10 20:55:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whatever comes to mind
2014-09-10 20:56:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you think?
2014-09-10 20:56:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm certainly not opposed to it
2014-09-10 20:56:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-09-10 20:56:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not necessarily for it either?
2014-09-10 20:57:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can test it out?
2014-09-10 20:57:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I am!
2014-09-10 20:57:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just wouldn't want it to feel forced 
2014-09-10 20:57:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-09-10 20:57:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not what I'm going for!
2014-09-10 20:57:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'll just make sure to do it when it comes to me
2014-09-10 20:57:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But like that time in Raleigh where I was on top of you and you were telling me all the things you liked about my body
2014-09-10 20:58:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was really fucking sexy
2014-09-10 20:58:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mmm
2014-09-10 20:58:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you get really primal on top I think
2014-09-10 20:58:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty sexy
2014-09-10 20:58:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-09-10 20:59:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm glad you like it
2014-09-10 21:00:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It sort of feels like I'm using you to make myself cum at the speed and angle I want 
2014-09-10 21:00:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I was actually thinking the same thing
2014-09-10 21:00:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like you're really focused on using my dick to get off
2014-09-10 21:01:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I guess I'm sort of into the idea of you liking my dick as an instrument for your pleasure
2014-09-10 21:01:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are many dicks you could choose from
2014-09-10 21:01:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you choose mine to grind on until you cum    😃 
2014-09-10 21:01:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or use yours to play with my nipples 
2014-09-10 21:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)))
2014-09-10 21:02:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's so fucking sexy that you're into that
2014-09-10 21:02:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I cannot overemphasize that
2014-09-10 21:05:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You wanna watch me masturbate?
2014-09-10 21:05:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]uhhh yeah
2014-09-10 21:06:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]while we're on the topic of dicks and tits let me also say I loved cumming on your tits
2014-09-10 21:39:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm playing with your nipple
2014-09-10 21:40:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think ex-wife
2014-09-10 21:40:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty sure there's pictures of them up still
2014-09-10 21:41:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you always play with your titties when you masturbate
2014-09-10 21:42:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you ever do ass play>
2014-09-10 21:42:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?

2014-09-11 08:37:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good morning, sunshine. I love you so much. Have a great day!

2014-09-11 09:30:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I must've turned off both my alarms in my sleep
2014-09-11 09:32:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anyways, good morning to you tooo
2014-09-11 09:32:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's impressive.
2014-09-11 10:29:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Merrrr
2014-09-11 10:30:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I blame the 65 deg weather and leaving my window open
2014-09-11 10:30:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Perfect temp?
2014-09-11 10:31:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely 
2014-09-11 10:31:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Perfect temp for snuggling that is
2014-09-11 10:31:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:))))
2014-09-11 10:32:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Miss you.
2014-09-11 11:15:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miss yew
2014-09-11 13:02:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘
2014-09-11 13:51:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey! I saved a non-naked snap of you. It's been a while...
2014-09-11 14:07:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I'll try to balance the naked and non-nakeds out a little better
2014-09-11 14:11:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe one day I'll get to see your naked body in person frequently enough I won't need so many sexy snaps ;)
2014-09-11 14:12:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe?? I'm counting on it mister
2014-09-11 14:12:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-09-11 14:54:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] That okCupid graph does not bode well for your chances of picking up two 21 yr olds at 29
2014-09-11 15:04:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I feel like you're challenging me.
2014-09-11 15:05:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How about this. I'll try to get two girls to 21 year olds to go home with me on my bachelor's trip, but once I get them to the cab I'll send them home.
2014-09-11 15:06:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll get to validate/crush my ego without the mess.
2014-09-11 15:10:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we slept together on our first date, huh?
2014-09-11 15:51:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually don't really want to talk about the 21 year old thing anymore. It gives me bad vibes. You're the only girl I want to flirt with and try to take home in the clubs!
2014-09-11 15:55:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-09-11 15:55:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry I brought it up again 
2014-09-11 15:56:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though if you just sent those girls home in the cab they'd probably be superrrr pissed lol
2014-09-11 15:56:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha no doubt.
2014-09-11 16:04:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When you thought I was my brother in my profile pic. Were you attracted to "the dude on the left"?
2014-09-11 16:20:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought I told you that!
2014-09-11 16:20:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How I thought, "dang he's kinda chunky in this picture, but his friend is hot"
2014-09-11 16:21:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you look ridiculously attractive in pictures from that wedding
2014-09-11 16:21:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You clean up well
2014-09-11 16:21:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha maybe you did! I only remembered you saying you weren't into my brother.
2014-09-11 16:22:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We'll have to get me some nice clothes at some point and go on some fancy dates every now and then.
2014-09-11 16:22:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-09-11 16:23:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm down for a non-rushed shopping trip
2014-09-11 16:24:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘
2014-09-11 16:27:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Talked to my mom on the phone just now, she says we should stay in Daniel's room instead of getting a hotel
2014-09-11 16:28:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you're bro's not gonna be there?
2014-09-11 16:32:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess not :/
2014-09-11 16:32:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah, that's too bad. You down with that arrangement, though?
2014-09-11 16:34:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, we'd still probably have to keep things quiet lol but his room isn't over their bed
2014-09-11 16:34:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool.
2014-09-11 16:34:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And she says we can sleep in or whatever
2014-09-11 16:35:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is that ok with you?
2014-09-11 16:35:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, for sure!
2014-09-11 16:35:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool
2014-09-11 16:37:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My professor gave us all our midterm dates and we're good on all of our trips. Could squeeze in a November one if we decide that's something we want to do too.
2014-09-11 16:38:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yay!
2014-09-11 17:39:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I may work in the lab from 8p-12a tonight...
2014-09-11 17:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's cool. I gotta work on homework too.
2014-09-11 17:41:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I left my oyster tissue digesting overnight last time, but the kit says they should be done anywhere between 1-8 hours so I was kind of hoping they'd be done in like 5
2014-09-11 17:42:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's looking more like 8?
2014-09-11 17:43:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, little fuckers
2014-09-11 17:44:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could leave them overnight again but I'd rather finish this up tonight 
2014-09-11 17:44:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also I did sleep in until like 10:30 so I kinda deserve it
2014-09-11 17:44:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha, maybe a little
2014-09-11 17:45:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my only request is a sexy lab snap at 10 PM
2014-09-11 17:47:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I'll try to make that happen without getting toxic chemicals on my ass cheeks
2014-09-11 17:47:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😮

2014-09-11 18:54:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]" 1) Getting Fired If two hands suddenly drop from the sky and start pulling you up, you’ve just been sacked. She’ll tell you she never cums from that anyway, but the truth is you suck at sucking. Just give her a jolly good rogering and look at the whole thing as a learning experience. Later you can ask what the problem was so you can get it right next time. If you’re really lame, you can ask for a regular play-by-play from the broadcast booth. A bit of the old “slow-down-you’re-going-too-fast–yeah-there-like-that-oh-that’s-perfect” can turn even the John Wayne Bobbitt of pussy eaters into a Doug Hart"
2014-09-11 18:54:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:(
2014-09-11 19:09:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-09-11 19:09:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you always fire me
2014-09-11 19:10:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just messing around, though.
2014-09-11 19:10:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, a lot of times it's because I'm really turned on and want your dick inside of me
2014-09-11 19:11:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, I kinda figured that had something to do with it    😉 
2014-09-11 19:12:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess there are some things you could do down there different that would make it a lot more likely for me to cum
2014-09-11 19:12:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like what?
2014-09-11 19:12:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've mentioned more fingering.
2014-09-11 19:12:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah that's mostly it
2014-09-11 19:13:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do you like being fingered?
2014-09-11 19:16:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I'm really turned on, at least 2 fingers
2014-09-11 19:16:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In and out slowly while licking my clit
2014-09-11 19:17:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]got it  👅  +  ✌      
2014-09-11 19:18:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely would like to make you cum more that way
2014-09-11 19:19:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes if it feels like it's taking too long I pull you up too
2014-09-11 19:19:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not because you're doing a bad job
2014-09-11 19:19:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty sure that's "being fired"
2014-09-11 19:19:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-11 19:19:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But just because I feel bad making you work down there for 20 minutes
2014-09-11 19:20:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I've ever been down there close to that
2014-09-11 19:20:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should leave me down there a little longer    😃 
2014-09-11 19:20:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'll incorporate fingering more
2014-09-11 19:20:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really do like doing it
2014-09-11 19:21:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I've only made you cum that way once?
2014-09-11 19:23:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-11 19:23:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do like sucking on my clit too
2014-09-11 19:24:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. I'll incorporate that too!
2014-09-11 19:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it'd really turn me on to get you off that way
2014-09-11 19:25:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-09-11 19:26:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]anything else?
2014-09-11 19:27:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, if I think of something while you're down there I'll let you know
2014-09-11 19:28:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whyd you start looking into pussy eating tips?
2014-09-11 19:28:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]saw a post on /r/sex
2014-09-11 19:29:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm excited to try it again.
2014-09-11 19:32:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm excited for any physical contact with you
2014-09-11 19:32:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw    😃  me too 
2014-09-11 19:37:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't wanna go back to schooooool
2014-09-11 19:37:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha you can do it, my love!
2014-09-11 19:40:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you'll be able to see me gush while you're down there
2014-09-11 19:41:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahahaha
2014-09-11 19:41:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think it's ever been witnessed, but I know it happens because of how wet I get after an orgasm and the spray patterns on the bed lol
2014-09-11 19:42:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I can tell when it happens
2014-09-11 19:42:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think those spray patterns are from you?
2014-09-11 19:42:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-11 19:42:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're like squirting around my cock?
2014-09-11 19:43:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you're behind me and I have those mega orgasms, I can feel myself cum with my fingers 
2014-09-11 19:44:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no kidding
2014-09-11 19:44:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does squirting make the orgasm feel different?
2014-09-11 19:46:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I've mentioned before, orgasms in that position do feel a lot more intense 
2014-09-11 19:47:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so squirting occurs with intense orgasms
2014-09-11 19:47:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or orgasms in a particular position? 
2014-09-11 19:47:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Specific stimuli can cause it?
2014-09-11 19:48:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-11 19:48:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it doesn't necessarily feel better
2014-09-11 19:48:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's different 
2014-09-11 19:49:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it's hard to call one orgasm a lot "better" than a other
2014-09-11 19:49:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're pretty great to begin with 
2014-09-11 19:49:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-09-11 19:49:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think mine can vary in quality
2014-09-11 19:50:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they're all also pretty great
2014-09-11 19:50:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what if you squirt on my face!
2014-09-11 19:51:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think it squirts really
2014-09-11 19:51:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it gushes
2014-09-11 19:51:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like a little waterfall
2014-09-11 19:51:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or trickle 
2014-09-11 19:51:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha how pretty!
2014-09-11 19:52:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I probably won't see it while I'm down there, though
2014-09-11 19:52:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz I'm not gonna stop licking your pussy while you're cumming
2014-09-11 19:53:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I feel like if you're down there you'll notice the increased wetness
2014-09-11 19:54:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think it comes (cums) from my vagina
2014-09-11 19:54:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where else is it gonna come from
2014-09-11 19:54:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My urethra 
2014-09-11 19:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh like the urethra
2014-09-11 19:55:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like where your ejaculation comes from lol 
2014-09-11 19:55:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-09-11 19:57:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is this shit not figured out
2014-09-11 19:58:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sexism man
2014-09-11 19:58:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously
2014-09-11 20:02:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you tell where your G-spot is?
2014-09-11 20:16:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm dubious that the gspot is an actual thing
2014-09-11 20:16:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#sexist
2014-09-11 20:17:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why are you dubious?
2014-09-11 20:18:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because there has been no convincing research that it is. And the reference to av"fleshy ridged spot" is silly because you're who he vagina is fleshy and ridged. But there is an area that I think is tied to my orgasms
2014-09-11 20:20:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-09-11 20:20:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like a 2014 review agrees with you
2014-09-11 20:21:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well, I dunno
2014-09-11 20:21:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they say no single consistent structure has been identified
2014-09-11 20:21:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25112854
2014-09-11 20:22:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess they generalize it to a "clitourethrovaginal" complex
2014-09-11 20:22:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-11 20:23:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So the front wall of my vagina could be more involved in stimulating orgasms
2014-09-11 20:23:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it's not a "dime sized area" like all the magazines say
2014-09-11 20:23:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-09-11 20:23:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]vaginas are so complex!
2014-09-11 20:35:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha you seem to navigate mine pretty well, even if it is blind luck :P
2014-09-11 20:35:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely blind luck. I think that's partially why I want to get good at eating you out, haha.
2014-09-11 20:36:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have full confidence in you
2014-09-11 20:37:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And am willing to let you practice as much as you want haha
2014-09-11 20:37:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yesss
2014-09-11 20:37:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna take you up on that offer!
2014-09-11 20:37:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe not right now
2014-09-11 20:37:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I definitely want to get good at it
2014-09-11 20:38:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I want to necessarily spend all four or five days we're gonna be seeing each other every time just licking your pussy, though
2014-09-11 20:38:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]although it wouldn't be the worst thing to happen
2014-09-11 20:42:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha ok yeah I'm not willing to give up fucking you for that long right now either
2014-09-11 20:42:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure we can get a couple practice sessions in without interfering with our fucking schedule too much    😉 
2014-09-11 23:52:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhh
2014-09-11 23:52:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm in the home stretch
2014-09-11 23:52:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, I believe in you!
2014-09-11 23:52:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The worst part about lab work is smelling like latex until you take a shower
2014-09-11 23:52:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's pretty gross
2014-09-11 23:53:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's better than smelling like dead animals and formaldehyde, though!
2014-09-11 23:53:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](me in college)
2014-09-12 00:13:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmm sexy
2014-09-12 00:14:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It just reminds me of condoms
2014-09-12 00:14:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Blegh
2014-09-12 00:14:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-12 00:37:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Done!
2014-09-12 00:38:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yay!
2014-09-12 00:38:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now I gotta wait for the shuttle so I can not get mugged on the way home
2014-09-12 00:38:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yay!
2014-09-12 00:39:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha
2014-09-12 00:44:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will you be awake in like 8 min?
2014-09-12 00:45:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably. You really gonna be 8 minutes? Haha
2014-09-12 00:45:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The shuttle is on the move!
2014-09-12 00:45:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ooook
2014-09-12 09:08:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good morning, sexy. Happy Friday!
2014-09-12 09:18:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Apparently spanking is illegal in several European countries.
2014-09-12 09:19:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]God morning 
2014-09-12 09:22:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Spanking for discipline, or any form of spanking?
2014-09-12 09:22:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]spanking kids
2014-09-12 09:23:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think they care if adults are consensually spanking each other    😉 
2014-09-12 10:45:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhh I can't get out if bed
2014-09-12 10:46:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's actually a rainy morning here
2014-09-12 10:48:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did some tricep push-ups and basic rows/flys with 6 lb weights on Wednesday 
2014-09-12 10:48:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my arms are SO SORE
2014-09-12 10:48:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a little embarrassing 
2014-09-12 10:48:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty solid, though
2014-09-12 10:48:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you do that at home?
2014-09-12 10:49:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-12 10:49:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. Just trying to get in some arm stuff?
2014-09-12 10:49:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How do I make them feel betterrrrr?
2014-09-12 10:50:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Take some Advil." - Katie Silliman
2014-09-12 10:51:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha. I used to workout at home like twice a week, doing full body, abs, arms, or booty workouts
2014-09-12 10:51:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright. Nice.
2014-09-12 10:51:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then I got so busy in May and late April that that stopped pretty quick lol
2014-09-12 10:54:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I am into the fact that you exercise.
2014-09-12 10:58:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha well that's good
2014-09-12 10:58:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you ever go on a run with me?
2014-09-12 10:58:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When the weather is nice, of course
2014-09-12 10:58:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ehhh
2014-09-12 10:59:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd give it a shot I guess
2014-09-12 10:59:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]running has typically been not enjoyable for me, though
2014-09-12 11:00:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd probably be whiny and ruin it for you
2014-09-12 11:00:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-12 11:01:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We wouldn't have to run that far
2014-09-12 11:01:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I always see couples running together on the lakeshore path and I'm a tiny bit jealous
2014-09-12 11:02:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that might be something I can't give you
2014-09-12 11:03:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll find a running buddy then 
2014-09-12 11:03:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do running buddies provide?
2014-09-12 11:03:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think Tom was running there for a while
2014-09-12 11:03:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I remember him talking about it in March
2014-09-12 11:03:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there was a group of people he was running with
2014-09-12 11:03:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mo runs a fair amount, and is usually looking for ppl to run with
2014-09-12 11:04:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do y'all talk?
2014-09-12 11:04:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or is just camaraderie? 
2014-09-12 11:04:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When we see each other 
2014-09-12 11:04:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh you mean buddies
2014-09-12 11:04:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-12 11:05:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mostly camaraderie. And it makes you accountable so you actually get out of bed to go run. Also it can sometimes helps to push you on days when you want to slow down
2014-09-12 11:06:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, that makes sense.
2014-09-12 11:08:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]come get in bed with me!
2014-09-12 11:08:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're still in bed??
2014-09-12 11:08:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sitting on my bed
2014-09-12 11:08:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but no not "still in bed"
2014-09-12 11:08:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got up at 8:30
2014-09-12 11:09:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know why incapable of sleeping fewer than 8 hours these days
2014-09-12 11:09:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's all good
2014-09-12 11:09:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe the desire going to school at a certain time is not enough pressure to get me up
2014-09-12 11:10:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I can definitely see that
2014-09-12 11:10:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sort of being held accountable I guess
2014-09-12 11:10:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]barely
2014-09-12 11:10:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's enough to make me get up
2014-09-12 11:10:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you don't start until 9?
2014-09-12 11:11:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't
2014-09-12 11:13:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm really missing you today
2014-09-12 11:38:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too
2014-09-12 11:39:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only about 5 more days!
2014-09-12 11:39:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃  Can't come soon enough 
2014-09-12 11:40:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can we go dancing?
2014-09-12 11:40:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sure!
2014-09-12 11:40:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some kind of dancing that you would also enjoy lol
2014-09-12 11:40:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah
2014-09-12 11:40:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can try to find something
2014-09-12 11:48:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or we can save that for when you visit 
2014-09-12 11:49:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah, I definitely want to go if we can find a good spot.
2014-09-12 11:49:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had a lot of fun in Raleigh that one time.
2014-09-12 11:49:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I like it when you dance up on me    😃 
2014-09-12 11:51:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too!
2014-09-12 11:53:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure we can find a sort of grungy place not full of 16 year olds 
2014-09-12 11:53:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-12 11:53:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-12 11:53:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be nice
2014-09-12 14:27:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah
2014-09-12 14:30:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘
2014-09-12 14:32:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miss you
2014-09-12 14:58:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Miss you too, sugar.
2014-09-12 16:07:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awww I loved that snap :)))
2014-09-12 16:53:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh well. MMS is dying anyway.
2014-09-12 16:54:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess
2014-09-12 16:54:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how's your day going, love?
2014-09-12 16:54:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mom still sends me pics
2014-09-12 16:55:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not bad, just set up some tissue digestions to finish tomorrow
2014-09-12 16:55:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Morning
2014-09-12 16:55:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]coool
2014-09-12 16:57:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://soundcloud.com/partyfavormusic/party-favor-bap-u-preview
2014-09-12 16:57:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's your day?
2014-09-12 16:57:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not bad
2014-09-12 16:58:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was pretty chilly
2014-09-12 16:58:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and sprinkling a bit
2014-09-12 16:58:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but at least I wasn't super hot and sweaty
2014-09-12 16:59:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woah, your weather is actually pretty similar to mine today
2014-09-12 16:59:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With just a 10 deg difference
2014-09-12 16:59:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I think it's supposed to get down in the 50s tonight!
2014-09-12 17:00:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Katy is still in the 80s!
2014-09-12 17:00:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah Dallas is gonna be back up in the 80s by SUnday
2014-09-12 17:01:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that Party Favor dude is gonna be playing the Saturday you're here
2014-09-12 17:01:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the venue might have 16 year olds
2014-09-12 17:01:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha it sounds fun!
2014-09-12 17:01:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$10
2014-09-12 17:02:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or $15 for "VIP 21+ area"
2014-09-12 17:03:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's just weird being around that particular scene not on some kind of drug, but I could get over it 
2014-09-12 17:03:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]should we do some drugs?
2014-09-12 17:03:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-12 17:04:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno
2014-09-12 17:05:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you said you didn't think rolling at those events was really your scene?
2014-09-12 17:05:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I've only ever legitimately rolled once at a music event.
2014-09-12 17:05:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]One time was shitty and I didn't roll
2014-09-12 17:06:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the other time it was probably LSD
2014-09-12 17:06:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if you don't want to we don't have to
2014-09-12 17:06:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]From what you described I think it was 2-CE or something like that, but I get your point
2014-09-12 17:07:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah maybe
2014-09-12 17:07:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I wouldn't know
2014-09-12 17:07:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]strong nausea seems to be good evidence
2014-09-12 17:10:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How would we get them?
2014-09-12 17:10:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could ask Dar
2014-09-12 17:11:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we wouldn't be sleeping that night.
2014-09-12 17:12:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah I have that 8a flight the next day
2014-09-12 17:24:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry I was such a bummer the past two weeks and made you feel crappy at times.
2014-09-12 17:24:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it all helped me sort my issues out, though.
2014-09-12 17:24:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If that's any consolation.
2014-09-12 17:25:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's ok
2014-09-12 17:25:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm glad that stuff got talked about now instead of being compartmentalized until later
2014-09-12 17:30:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you.
2014-09-12 17:32:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you too
2014-09-12 17:33:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, I'm down to roll if you are 
2014-09-12 17:33:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean we have a hotel room, we might as well take advantage of it
2014-09-12 17:34:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?'
2014-09-12 17:35:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If we were to go out rolling to a show here and come back we'd have to be a little quiet 
2014-09-12 17:36:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we can talk and cuddle until 6a in a hotel room and not have to clean up the next day!
2014-09-12 17:36:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word, that sounds good
2014-09-12 17:37:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll send Dar a message
2014-09-12 17:37:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You prefer Molly, right?
2014-09-12 17:39:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess if he knows of pills that are good then I trust his judgement
2014-09-12 17:41:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-09-12 17:43:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I probably should've asked him earlier because he's leaving for Austin next Thursday for the weekend.
2014-09-12 17:43:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But hopefully we'll be able to get some.
2014-09-12 17:43:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you'll see him for his bday thing, right?
2014-09-12 17:44:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I meant more in him being able to acquire some.
2014-09-12 17:45:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe we should start an MDMA lab
2014-09-12 17:45:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-12 17:46:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean I can probably my get access to most things in it
2014-09-12 17:46:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think?
2014-09-12 17:48:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I google "how to make mdma" will the government find me?
2014-09-12 17:48:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Already did it for you, hon  😘   
2014-09-12 17:49:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like a lot of stuff can be picked up in stores
2014-09-12 17:50:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's crazy that there's some person out there in a lab making all this stuff
2014-09-12 17:50:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably being real clinical like Breaking Bad
2014-09-12 17:50:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-12 17:53:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I could get a lot of stuff so you don't have to distill from over the counter chemicals I guess
2014-09-12 17:53:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]true
2014-09-12 17:53:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not actually gonna do it, haha
2014-09-12 17:54:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you need a lot of gear and time
2014-09-12 17:55:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-09-12 17:56:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it would be way more convenient!
2014-09-12 17:56:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-09-12 17:56:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]these instructions I'm reading make like 150 hits
2014-09-12 17:56:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we're reading the same one
2014-09-12 17:57:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably it was the first page when I Googled for it
2014-09-12 17:59:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe one day before we have kids we'll make a batch in our garage lol
2014-09-12 17:59:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I actually think that'd be really fun for us
2014-09-12 18:00:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And apparently if stored properly mdma does not degrade 
2014-09-12 18:01:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so one batch would have us set basically
2014-09-12 18:01:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're not gonna be here for the naughtiest schoolgirl contest    😞 
2014-09-12 18:01:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.thelizardlounge.com/Lizard_Lounge_Event.php?eventid=2225
2014-09-12 18:03:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh darn!
2014-09-12 18:07:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't win anyways
2014-09-12 18:07:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm too old
2014-09-12 18:08:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't know... you're pretty sexy
2014-09-12 18:08:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I probably wouldn't mind seeing you in a sexy school girl outfit
2014-09-12 18:09:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more just a short skirt in general
2014-09-12 18:10:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you'd have a pretty good shot
2014-09-12 18:10:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you got the booty game down
2014-09-12 18:10:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you've got a really pretty face
2014-09-12 18:10:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you got nice tits
2014-09-12 18:10:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even if they aren't huge
2014-09-12 18:10:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't really think most guys are into huge tits
2014-09-12 18:11:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you've got the curly hair thing going
2014-09-12 18:11:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which would make you stand out
2014-09-12 18:11:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that might actually be the difference maker
2014-09-12 18:11:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-09-12 18:11:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm very flattered 
2014-09-12 18:12:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think my hair does make me look younger than I am
2014-09-12 18:12:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-12 18:12:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have a pretty youthful look in general I think
2014-09-12 18:13:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does that bother you?
2014-09-12 18:15:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh, occasionally I get some crap from bouncers about my id being fake and it is kinda frustrating when ppl voice how surprised they are when I say how old I am sometimes 
2014-09-12 18:15:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess it's not the worst 
2014-09-12 18:16:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't think you look THAT young
2014-09-12 18:16:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I could see like 20
2014-09-12 18:16:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that doesn't seem young enough for bouncers to really be skeptical
2014-09-12 18:17:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]20 is still illegal lol
2014-09-12 18:17:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but like
2014-09-12 18:18:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It happens more when I'm with younger people too
2014-09-12 18:18:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do 20 year olds really look much younger than 21?
2014-09-12 18:18:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like if I thought you looked 18
2014-09-12 18:18:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-09-12 18:18:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe you're just getting lumped in with the younger people
2014-09-12 18:18:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah. And my id does look like shit
2014-09-12 18:18:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it really does
2014-09-12 18:19:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've just gotta stay looking 22 forever so I'll stay attracted to you
2014-09-12 18:21:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or just marry you before I start to noticeably age so you're stuck with me 
2014-09-12 18:22:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-12 18:22:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooooh
2014-09-12 18:22:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so  that's  why you want to get married
2014-09-12 18:22:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]all makes sense now
2014-09-12 18:23:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because I want to spend the rest if my life with you, even if it's against your will?
2014-09-12 18:23:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously!
2014-09-12 18:23:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-12 18:23:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]audibly laughing
2014-09-12 18:24:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much
2014-09-12 18:24:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😊
2014-09-12 18:27:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I invited Dallas to come over to hang and play video games, and he was interested
2014-09-12 18:27:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like fun
2014-09-12 18:27:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then texted a while later saying " On my way to Simon's"
2014-09-12 18:27:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I'll get some Dead Space in tonight
2014-09-12 18:27:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh
2014-09-12 18:28:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so is he not coming over then?
2014-09-12 18:28:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess not, and I don't really know if I'm actually invited over there
2014-09-12 18:29:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-09-12 18:29:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he texted you out of the blue saying he was going there?
2014-09-12 18:30:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I texted saying come over anytime after 6:30
2014-09-12 18:30:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And he responded with on the way to Simons right now
2014-09-12 18:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't really know him well enough to say what that means
2014-09-12 18:31:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Honestly I don't know why I'm even trying to still be friends with them 
2014-09-12 18:31:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]most of the people I hang out with would either say something came up or invite me explicitly
2014-09-12 18:31:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-12 18:32:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why do you say that?
2014-09-12 18:32:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because they're cliquish and I know they gossip and spread misinformation about everyone (including me)
2014-09-12 18:33:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And this is a pretty typical Dallas move
2014-09-12 18:33:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😕 
2014-09-12 18:34:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To leave things vague and then critique whatever way I interpret them. He enjoys riling people up
2014-09-12 18:34:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well you are one to get riled
2014-09-12 18:35:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then I shouldn't hang out with someone who takes advantage of that
2014-09-12 18:35:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's one possibility
2014-09-12 18:35:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could also try to not let the things he does get under your skin
2014-09-12 18:37:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just go hang out if you want to
2014-09-12 18:41:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't like feeling unwanted, even if it's just in my head. It's definitely an issue of mine. But I find I enjoy myself a lot more around people who are genuine in their actions and intents 
2014-09-12 18:41:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or at least upfront 
2014-09-12 18:41:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I think I'll just find something else to do 
2014-09-12 18:41:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. Yeah, maybe it would be good to quit hanging out with them for a bit then.
2014-09-12 18:42:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hopefully you'll mesh with some of the incoming students.
2014-09-12 18:42:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it seems like the years after Haley's year have some weird dynamics going on
2014-09-12 18:43:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess there are only two at this point?
2014-09-12 18:43:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you and the one above?
2014-09-12 18:44:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-12 18:45:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My year doesn't really have any drama, just some of them don't really hang with the cluster
2014-09-12 18:45:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I wasn't implying that
2014-09-12 18:45:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just that they were also kinda different from other cohorts
2014-09-12 19:27:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might hang out with Haley
2014-09-12 19:28:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-09-12 19:57:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You playing dead space tonight?
2014-09-12 19:57:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably. Once I get around to finishing this damn algorithms homework
2014-09-12 19:57:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you and Haley gonna do
2014-09-12 19:58:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's coming over in a few minutes 
2014-09-12 19:58:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We might smoke and just hang out
2014-09-12 19:58:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bake some cupcakes
2014-09-12 19:58:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's cool
2014-09-12 19:59:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]misss youuu
2014-09-12 19:59:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miss youuuuuyuuuuuuuuuuuuu
2014-09-12 20:00:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we need like a brain simulator
2014-09-12 20:00:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the matrix
2014-09-12 20:00:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where we can be with each other but not really?
2014-09-12 20:00:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-12 20:01:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sync up and feel like we are in our brains
2014-09-12 20:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just imagining if we had simulated sex in class
2014-09-12 20:03:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If we simulated cuddling together at night while we're sleeping 
2014-09-12 20:04:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd definitely sleep better
2014-09-12 20:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw. That's pretty adorable.
2014-09-12 20:04:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd totally be down with that being the only thing the machine was capable of.
2014-09-12 20:06:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if we'd even feel motivated to live together if we could simulate it?
2014-09-12 22:43:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it would depend on the quality of the simulation 
2014-09-12 22:44:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey honey
2014-09-12 22:44:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey, sugar.
2014-09-12 22:44:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to?
2014-09-12 22:45:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Playing a little Dead Space. What about you?
2014-09-12 22:45:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haley just left
2014-09-12 22:45:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cleaning up some dishes and stuff
2014-09-12 22:45:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. Y'all have a good time?
2014-09-12 22:46:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah! We made peach martinis and mushroom quesadillas for dinner
2014-09-12 22:50:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice!
2014-09-12 22:50:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]let me know when you're done with Dead Space
2014-09-12 22:51:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I'm up I'll cchat with you
2014-09-12 22:51:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dude, how do I fucking zero gravity jump?
2014-09-12 22:51:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On the computer?
2014-09-12 22:52:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like what buttons did you push on Xbox?
2014-09-12 22:52:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What else did the buttons do.
2014-09-12 22:53:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On the XBox you move your view point over an area and focus your sight on it with the trigger, if it was green you could jump by depressing the trigger
2014-09-12 22:54:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wait you press Y while pressing keft trigger towards the area you want to jump
2014-09-12 22:54:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*left
2014-09-12 22:54:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What does y usually do?

2014-09-12 22:56:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fucking finally figured it out. I've been in this zero gravity room for like ten minutes.
2014-09-12 22:56:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah that's what it is.
2014-09-12 22:56:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha I'm sorry
2014-09-12 22:56:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's hard to think of that stuff when you are't directly playing it!
2014-09-12 22:57:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah I'm pretty impressed!
2014-09-12 22:57:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What kind of cats like to go bowling?

2014-09-13 10:35:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha good
2014-09-13 10:43:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]  I'm glad you care about my day!
2014-09-13 10:45:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Man... I just love you so much. I can't wait to see you.
2014-09-13 10:59:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes when you say stuff like that, I feel like any response I give would not fully express how happy it made me
2014-09-13 11:00:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]SO HAPPY!!!!!
2014-09-13 11:07:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha 😘😘😘
2014-09-13 11:32:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd tell you what I daydreamed about during my walk to campus, but we agreed to stop talking about that event :)
2014-09-13 11:33:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm you gotta tell me now!
2014-09-13 11:34:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh c'mon
2014-09-13 11:34:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really don't know what you're talking about. Give me a hint.
2014-09-13 11:35:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How many daydream worthy events have we talked about recently and then agreed to stop discussing the details?
2014-09-13 11:37:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm having trouble remembering :(
2014-09-13 11:37:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oooh
2014-09-13 11:37:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I remember now! :))))
2014-09-13 11:38:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha silly
2014-09-13 11:38:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The coursera course I was excited about taking is postponed :/
2014-09-13 11:39:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I saw your email. That's a bummer.
2014-09-13 12:32:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You don't introduce Alan before you start referring to him, and there's a "to to" and a "but" instead of a "put".
2014-09-13 12:32:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's really good, though!
2014-09-13 12:32:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I introduced him in a previous post!
2014-09-13 12:33:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm, I don't know if you can expect people to remember individuals from previous posts.
2014-09-13 12:34:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe add a parenthetical (who I introduced in this blog post [link])
2014-09-13 12:34:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-09-13 12:36:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That might need to be "whom"
2014-09-13 12:37:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]def whom
2014-09-13 12:38:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I guess it should be "whom I introduced you to"
2014-09-13 12:39:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or maybe not. Not really sure.
2014-09-13 12:42:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just said (introduced here)with a link to the page in here
2014-09-13 12:43:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's way better, lol

2014-09-13 14:19:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know how many credits and debits have been made at this point

2014-09-13 14:24:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too
2014-09-13 14:30:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was watching football? 
2014-09-13 14:31:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty good. Carl's gonna join us Thursday for the Auburn game.
2014-09-13 14:31:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And we'll probably hang out with him on Friday.
2014-09-13 14:31:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we wouldn't even need the rental car! Lol
2014-09-13 14:31:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That'll be fun though
2014-09-13 14:32:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh yeah. I guess you're right.
2014-09-13 14:33:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it too late to cancel the reservation, or do you think it'll still be worth it?
2014-09-13 14:34:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]eh. It's all good.
2014-09-13 14:34:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's like 20$/day
2014-09-13 14:35:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they can't be cancelled anyway
2014-09-13 14:36:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can find some use for it. Even if it's just giving us extra snuggle time before you go to class lol
2014-09-13 14:36:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha worth it!
2014-09-13 14:37:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is there visitor parking? I was thinking of driving you to your Friday class and just chilling on campus until you're done 
2014-09-13 14:38:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like you can get a visitor pass from the bookstore
2014-09-13 14:38:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or there's pay by the hour parking
2014-09-13 14:39:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.utdallas.edu/services/transit/park/#visitor
2014-09-13 14:39:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool
2014-09-13 14:40:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm getting excited.
2014-09-13 14:40:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh
2014-09-13 14:40:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😡 
2014-09-13 14:41:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obvs I'm excited too
2014-09-13 15:08:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what if I don't live up to your daydream?    😮 
2014-09-13 15:29:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You willllll
2014-09-13 15:29:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Most of the daydream was just about being engaged in the first place
2014-09-13 15:35:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Letting everyone know how much we love each other 
2014-09-13 15:36:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha so sappy
2014-09-13 15:37:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whatttttt
2014-09-13 15:37:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha I don't mind it
2014-09-13 15:37:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd hope not, you can be snappier than me!
2014-09-13 15:38:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no way
2014-09-13 15:38:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*sappier
2014-09-13 15:38:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Way
2014-09-13 15:39:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-13 15:39:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]got 'em
2014-09-13 15:39:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I'm sure if you quantified the number of sappy comments we each make I'd probably have a considerable lead
2014-09-13 15:45:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I said "I love you" first 
2014-09-13 15:45:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I win
2014-09-13 15:46:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except you don't even recall it
2014-09-13 15:46:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whereas I do recall it
2014-09-13 16:03:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Blah blah blah
2014-09-13 16:03:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Minor details
2014-09-13 16:05:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your grandma liked reading about my science project!
2014-09-13 16:09:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice. And she used proper capitalization!
2014-09-13 16:11:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go grandma!
2014-09-13 16:13:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you go on an ex unfriending and refriending spree in 2013?
2014-09-13 16:14:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ummm I dunno
2014-09-13 16:14:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why?
2014-09-13 16:14:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm I may have unfriended Scott after I graduated for a bit actually
2014-09-13 16:14:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you became friends with Cam and Scott
2014-09-13 16:14:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cam unfriended me and then refriended me like 2 times 
2014-09-13 16:27:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I deleted so much shit from my Facebook
2014-09-13 16:28:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-13 16:28:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your mom friend requested me!
2014-09-13 16:58:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What'd you delete?
2014-09-13 16:59:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even remember.
2014-09-13 16:59:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Anything affectionate between me and exes
2014-09-13 16:59:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]anything excessively embarassing
2014-09-13 17:10:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why?
2014-09-13 17:10:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Guess I didn't want it out in the open or to be reminded of it.
2014-09-13 17:11:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's interesting, considering you just uploaded a bunch of pictures of an ex on google +
2014-09-13 17:12:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did that stuff a while ago.
2014-09-13 17:12:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I actually had to ask her for those pictures back.
2014-09-13 17:12:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because I deleted all of them off my hard drive.
2014-09-13 17:12:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-13 17:12:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh well I just noticed they were uploaded a couple weeks ago I guess 
2014-09-13 17:13:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I wanted to back them up on G+
2014-09-13 17:13:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also it doesn't seem like your actual relationships were particularly unpleasant, just the break ups
2014-09-13 17:14:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I didn't like the thought of people going through my past relationships
2014-09-13 17:14:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still don't.
2014-09-13 17:14:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I untagged myself from every pic I'm in with Hannah.
2014-09-13 17:14:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I think I deleted every post between us too.
2014-09-13 17:15:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who would take the time to go through that stuff? 
2014-09-13 17:15:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except for me I guess lol
2014-09-13 17:16:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Exactly, potential girlfriends.
2014-09-13 17:16:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And people who are curious I guess.
2014-09-13 17:17:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do wish I kept it now, though, I guess.
2014-09-13 17:18:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean whatever makes you happy, dear. It's your Facebook
2014-09-13 17:19:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I can't undo it at this point
2014-09-13 17:19:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-13 17:21:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't think excessive dwelling on OR forgetting of the past is particularly healthy or beneficial to present happiness 
2014-09-13 17:22:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe. Forgetting was good for me at the time.
2014-09-13 17:22:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and unfriending my exes was definitely good for me.
2014-09-13 17:23:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah that all makes sense 
2014-09-13 17:25:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, at least your next girlfriend won't feel intimidated by your previous relationships!
2014-09-13 17:25:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-09-13 17:26:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I won't have to untag myself from any pictures!
2014-09-13 17:27:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except for the 3 with me :/
2014-09-13 17:28:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's what I'm saying.
2014-09-13 17:28:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd barely have to untag any for this relationship.
2014-09-13 17:29:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, there's only 3 really blatant bf/gf pics
2014-09-13 17:36:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anywayssss
2014-09-13 17:36:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I went for a 4 mile run earlier
2014-09-13 17:37:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was it?
2014-09-13 17:39:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how long does that take you?
2014-09-13 17:40:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It took me about 36 min today
2014-09-13 17:40:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So 9 min miles
2014-09-13 17:41:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was good! Even though it's chilly outside, the weather is beautiful
2014-09-13 17:41:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's good
2014-09-13 17:41:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd definitely vomit
2014-09-13 17:45:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When was the last time you ran?
2014-09-13 17:46:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Football?
2014-09-13 17:46:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So like 16/17?
2014-09-13 17:46:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I'm not even sure how much "running" was done then
2014-09-13 17:46:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]never more than a mile I'd imagine
2014-09-13 17:47:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So how do you know you still hate it??
2014-09-13 17:47:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you just didn't like sprints in football
2014-09-13 17:47:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what would change?
2014-09-13 17:48:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not equating sprints with running here
2014-09-13 17:48:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'd be more inclined to do a sprint workout than a jogging workout if it cmae down to it.
2014-09-13 17:49:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're body has probably changed significantly 
2014-09-13 17:50:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pleaseee go running with me at some point?
2014-09-13 17:50:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just to try
2014-09-13 17:50:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-09-13 17:50:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how far?
2014-09-13 17:51:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How far would you want to try?
2014-09-13 17:51:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't want to try... haha
2014-09-13 17:51:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh there's no point 
2014-09-13 17:52:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've decided to hate it so you will
2014-09-13 17:53:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, cuz clearly everyone loves running and that's why so many people do it!
2014-09-13 17:53:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-09-13 17:54:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're acting like I don't like running because of some personal bias or something
2014-09-13 17:54:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]rather than just simply not enjoying it
2014-09-13 17:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm down with going for a run with you
2014-09-13 17:54:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just saying if you go into it with your mind made up that you're going to hate it based on experiences you had 10 years ago, then you will hate it no natter what
2014-09-13 17:55:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm not sure what about my body/psychology would change that would make me want to go running
2014-09-13 17:56:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nevermind
2014-09-13 17:56:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]never mind what?
2014-09-13 17:57:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]About going for a run together. I should respect your opinions
2014-09-13 17:57:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said I'm down with going for a run.
2014-09-13 18:00:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not a big deal either way
2014-09-13 18:00:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]k
2014-09-13 18:05:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-09-13 18:07:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you!
2014-09-13 18:11:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a really productive Saturday! It feels good
2014-09-13 18:12:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yay!
2014-09-13 18:12:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna try to be productive at some point... maybe
2014-09-13 18:12:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty hungry right now
2014-09-13 18:12:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I don't have any groceries
2014-09-13 18:12:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Booo
2014-09-13 18:12:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]should I eat McDonald's?
2014-09-13 18:13:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Umm
2014-09-13 18:13:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How many times did you eat fast food this week?
2014-09-13 18:13:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]twice
2014-09-13 18:13:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-13 18:13:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had Chick-fil-A twice
2014-09-13 18:13:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Subway once
2014-09-13 18:13:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That might be it?
2014-09-13 18:14:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There's also a Golden Chick, a Jack In the Box, and a Burger Island
2014-09-13 18:14:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh wait no
2014-09-13 18:14:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]those are on Arapaho
2014-09-13 18:14:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Burger Street
2014-09-13 18:14:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]McDonald's
2014-09-13 18:14:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Subway
2014-09-13 18:15:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd vote subway over mcdonalds 
2014-09-13 18:15:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]those other restaurants are like a mile away
2014-09-13 18:17:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You could get a salad at mcdonalds!
2014-09-13 18:17:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you want me to wither away?
2014-09-13 18:17:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With chicken in it
2014-09-13 18:17:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And salad dressing 
2014-09-13 18:17:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-13 18:18:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Still a billion calories 
2014-09-13 18:18:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is it?
2014-09-13 18:19:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bacon ranch salad with crispy chicken has 395 calories and 26 g of protein 
2014-09-13 18:19:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's not a lot of calories.
2014-09-13 18:19:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A solid protein serving, though.
2014-09-13 18:20:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably just go with a quarter pounder
2014-09-13 18:20:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-13 18:20:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Southwest salad with chicken has 450
2014-09-13 18:20:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It has fire-roasted corn!
2014-09-13 18:21:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oooh!
2014-09-13 18:21:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is a quarter pounder really bad for me?
2014-09-13 18:22:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like does it for sure clog my arteries?
2014-09-13 18:22:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-13 18:22:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It has 92mg of cholesterol and 40% your dv of far
2014-09-13 18:22:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*fat
2014-09-13 18:23:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And zero nutrients other than protein
2014-09-13 18:23:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But a salad has green stuff and carrots and black beans!
2014-09-13 18:23:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]iceberg lettuce has zero nutritional value
2014-09-13 18:24:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't really understand how the clogging of arteries works
2014-09-13 18:24:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should probably look into that
2014-09-13 18:24:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It has 16 different kinds of leafy greens
2014-09-13 18:24:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-13 18:29:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not gonna tell you what to do, but I recommend the salad. 
2014-09-13 18:29:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, and I recommend you stop drinking so much
2014-09-13 18:30:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is the mechanism for cholesterol?
2014-09-13 18:30:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like how does high cholesterol kill me?
2014-09-13 18:30:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much am I allowed to eat?
2014-09-13 18:31:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It causes plaque buildup in your arteries which harden. Then either it blocks the flow of blood or bursts due to decreases elasticity 
2014-09-13 18:31:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so like every bit of cholesterol I eat goes to clogging my arteries?
2014-09-13 18:33:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's some difference between "good" and "bad" cholesterol 
2014-09-13 18:33:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And your body does break some of it down before it becomes a plaque
2014-09-13 18:33:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But once a plaque forms, only medicine or surgery can shrink it
2014-09-13 18:35:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WebMD says I can have 300 mg of cholesterol a day
2014-09-13 18:36:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's 95 mg in a quarter pounder meal
2014-09-13 18:38:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What'd you have for breakfast and lunch?
2014-09-13 18:38:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, more nutrients and fiber in the salad! 
2014-09-13 18:38:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bananas Foster french toast
2014-09-13 18:38:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bacon
2014-09-13 18:38:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]orange juice
2014-09-13 18:38:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one beer
2014-09-13 18:38:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no lunch
2014-09-13 18:39:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what nutrients are you referring to?
2014-09-13 18:39:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like
2014-09-13 18:39:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't understand what all these things do
2014-09-13 18:40:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]will I feel sick if I don't get enough of a certain nutrient?
2014-09-13 18:40:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fiber is good for your digestive system health
2014-09-13 18:41:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And lowers cholesterol levels
2014-09-13 18:41:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Vitamin A is good for your vision and immune system 
2014-09-13 18:42:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so if my vision and immune system are good
2014-09-13 18:42:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm getting enough?
2014-09-13 18:43:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't want your vision to go bad and then start to eat more vitamin A
2014-09-13 18:43:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It doesn't work that way
2014-09-13 18:43:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you def don't eat enough fiber
2014-09-13 18:43:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your poops must be so disappointing 
2014-09-13 18:43:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't even know what that means
2014-09-13 18:44:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty sure my poops are epic
2014-09-13 18:44:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How often do you poop?
2014-09-13 18:44:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it varies
2014-09-13 18:44:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty sure I have some kind of IBS
2014-09-13 18:44:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess IBS more a symptom
2014-09-13 18:44:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so not really "some kind"
2014-09-13 18:46:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, there you go. Not enough fiber
2014-09-13 18:47:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.joybauer.com/food-articles/leafy-green-vegetables.aspx
2014-09-13 18:47:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What all the vitamins in green vegetables do
2014-09-13 18:48:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I get enough of most of these, though.
2014-09-13 18:48:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like you barely need any of these.
2014-09-13 18:48:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Drinking some O.J. probably gives me most of what I need of all these.
2014-09-13 18:49:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The only thing OJ has 100% of is Vitamin C
2014-09-13 18:49:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Everything else it has is below 15%
2014-09-13 18:50:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it has zero Vitamin A 
2014-09-13 18:51:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do you get your Vitamin A?
2014-09-13 18:51:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Carrots, some green vegetables 
2014-09-13 18:51:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A multivitamin 
2014-09-13 18:52:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get 30% DV Vitamin A from my cereal in the morning.
2014-09-13 18:52:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which doesn't sound all that healthy
2014-09-13 18:52:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm assuming I pick up the rest throughout the rest of hte day
2014-09-13 18:53:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]10% in glass of O.J.
2014-09-13 18:53:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I just need to get 60% the rest of the day.
2014-09-13 18:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm more concerned about shit killing me cuz I'm getting too much than not getting enough.
2014-09-13 18:54:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think people are dying from a lack of Vitamin A.
2014-09-13 18:54:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can see the fiber argument.
2014-09-13 18:55:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll let you dictate my fiber diet when we live together.
2014-09-13 18:55:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, maybe low vitamin A increases cancer risk
2014-09-13 18:55:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha fine, eat whatever you want for the next 8 months
2014-09-13 18:55:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Doesn't your dad have blood pressure issues?
2014-09-13 18:56:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. Does he?
2014-09-13 18:56:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think my mom does, actually.
2014-09-13 18:56:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought they mentioned something about it at dinner
2014-09-13 18:56:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty sure it's my mom
2014-09-13 19:01:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and alcohol is bad for you
2014-09-13 19:01:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like that negates everything else
2014-09-13 19:13:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or if you're healthy in all other aspects, then you can drink heavily occasionally and it will mitigate the effects
2014-09-13 19:13:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that true?
2014-09-13 19:15:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know, maybe
2014-09-13 19:26:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why would you assume that factor would  have a greater impact or negate all if the other ones?
2014-09-13 19:26:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it's really bad for you
2014-09-13 19:27:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]exercising can negate a lot of the effects of high cholesterol/blood pressure
2014-09-13 19:27:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it doesn't make it easier for your liver to process alcohol
2014-09-13 19:28:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it doesn't make it have less of an effect on your brain
2014-09-13 19:30:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright I'm in my way to Daniela's to hang out before the concert tonight. 
2014-09-13 19:30:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Enjoy your burger, love you!
2014-09-13 19:31:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]enjoy your alcohol, love you too!
2014-09-13 19:35:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We are quite a pair of sassy motherfuckers when we want to be :)
2014-09-13 23:39:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Btw, I love you 
2014-09-14 00:34:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to?
2014-09-14 00:35:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not much. What about you?
2014-09-14 00:35:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Almost home 
2014-09-14 00:36:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wanna video in a few?
2014-09-14 00:37:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sure.
2014-09-14 01:16:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yo fuck you
2014-09-14 01:16:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-14 01:17:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I can't hate on you for hanging up on me when you disagree 
2014-09-14 01:17:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've done that too
2014-09-14 01:17:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't hang up on you
2014-09-14 01:18:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's not about disagreeing
2014-09-14 01:18:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's the way you argue
2014-09-14 01:18:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you always say shit like that
2014-09-14 01:18:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I'm some fucking idiot
2014-09-14 01:19:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I can't think of a time where I've actually been wrong about something is some demonstrable way
2014-09-14 01:20:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't say you were an idiot
2014-09-14 01:21:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just fundamentally disagreed with your method of analysis 
2014-09-14 01:21:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could be totally off base
2014-09-14 01:21:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then why would you say it's "bad data analysis"
2014-09-14 01:23:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aright, I'll confer with other scientists (hypothetically of course) and see what they think
2014-09-14 01:25:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I do truly believe it is bad data analysis, because it is letting the results influence your classification of the data
2014-09-14 01:25:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I could've put that in a nicer way
2014-09-14 01:25:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So as not to hurt your feelings
2014-09-14 01:25:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my feelings aren't hurt
2014-09-14 01:26:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well so you don't feel like a "fucking idiot"
2014-09-14 01:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't feel like a fucking idiot
2014-09-14 01:26:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you talk to me like I'm a fucking idiot
2014-09-14 01:27:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, I'll work on that
2014-09-14 01:27:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good night
2014-09-14 01:31:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kinda feel like if I was a dude presenting this argument to you, you would not have had the same response. Instead maybe you would've addressed my concerns with your methods in an intelligent way instead of trying to make me feel bad. But maybe I'm wrong.
2014-09-14 02:00:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Now I can't sleep... thanks!
2014-09-14 02:05:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Must suck to be dating an imbecile misogynist.
2014-09-14 07:30:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry that my manner of disagreeing comes across as a personal attack. Obviously I don't think you're an idiot. If there is a better way for me to express my opinions and ideas when they are contrary to yours please let me know. 
2014-09-14 07:32:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the comment about how you would treat a male colleague differently in this situation was off base. I apologize. 
2014-09-14 07:33:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you told me I was doing "bad science" I would also get pretty upset. I should choose my words more carefully.
2014-09-14 07:33:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you.
2014-09-14 11:54:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey
2014-09-14 11:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]howdy
2014-09-14 11:55:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's up?
2014-09-14 11:55:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]working a bit. What's up with you?
2014-09-14 11:55:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Still in bed
2014-09-14 11:56:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-09-14 11:56:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm a prisoner of the kitty's snuggle 
2014-09-14 11:56:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Stockholm Syndrome
2014-09-14 11:56:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha exactly 
2014-09-14 12:10:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only 3 more days!
2014-09-14 12:11:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yay!
2014-09-14 12:17:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you remessage Dar?
2014-09-14 12:17:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no I'll do that now.
2014-09-14 12:28:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm in the market for a new tablet
2014-09-14 12:29:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-14 12:29:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why's that?
2014-09-14 12:29:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My iPad is 5 years old
2014-09-14 12:29:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And starting to slow down as far as app stuff goes
2014-09-14 12:29:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the whole her fiasco was not comforting 
2014-09-14 12:30:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was more of an Apple thing than the iPad's fault
2014-09-14 12:30:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm sure there's a way around that
2014-09-14 12:30:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well that's why I'm looking into other OS tablets
2014-09-14 12:31:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, alright
2014-09-14 12:31:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you looking at?
2014-09-14 12:31:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know
2014-09-14 12:31:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you have any recommendations?
2014-09-14 12:32:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's gonna be a new Nexus tablet coming out soon
2014-09-14 12:32:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's probably what I'd buy if I was in the market
2014-09-14 12:33:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why?
2014-09-14 12:34:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're generally a good deal
2014-09-14 12:34:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and Google has a lot of control over Nexus hardware
2014-09-14 12:35:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know when it's gonna be released, though
2014-09-14 12:35:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.engadget.com/2014/09/10/nvidia-hints-at-htc-nexus-9/
2014-09-14 12:35:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the Tegra K1 is supposed to be a pretty sick chip too
2014-09-14 12:36:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I think this might be the first device to have one
2014-09-14 12:36:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not the first
2014-09-14 12:36:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm
2014-09-14 12:36:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but only a couple have come out
2014-09-14 12:36:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would definitely wait until it's released
2014-09-14 12:37:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you know all of your options
2014-09-14 12:37:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]read the reviews of it
2014-09-14 12:37:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's probably going to be cheap for what it'll be packing
2014-09-14 12:37:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the previous model is the Nexus 7
2014-09-14 12:37:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and both versions of that got rave reviews
2014-09-14 12:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they had a 2012 and 2013 model
2014-09-14 12:37:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found a review for a nexus 10
2014-09-14 12:38:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah people really like the Nexus 10 too
2014-09-14 12:38:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it doesn't look like there's gonna be a new one
2014-09-14 12:38:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd they go from 7 to 10?
2014-09-14 12:38:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's the size
2014-09-14 12:38:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm confused lol
2014-09-14 12:38:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhhhh
2014-09-14 12:38:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nexus 7 is 7 inch
2014-09-14 12:38:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]10 is 10 inch
2014-09-14 12:38:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]etc.
2014-09-14 12:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the 10 inch is the size of full-sized iPad
2014-09-14 12:39:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so a 9 inch would be a little smaller
2014-09-14 12:39:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the 7 inch is around an iPad Mini I think
2014-09-14 12:48:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-14 12:48:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll wait until it comes out
2014-09-14 12:49:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right now it seems like the iPad Air is the best on the market based on a number of reviews
2014-09-14 12:50:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah you're already in the Apple ecosystem anyway
2014-09-14 12:50:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if it lasts another 5+ years, I wouldn't mind spending the extra $100
2014-09-14 12:51:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I mean it's probably not even worth waiting then
2014-09-14 12:52:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well what if this new one is just totally amazing?
2014-09-14 12:52:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean, what's "amazing"?
2014-09-14 12:52:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You just need it to watch videos and read papers right?
2014-09-14 12:52:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]any tablet that's out can do that.
2014-09-14 12:52:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And take notes
2014-09-14 12:53:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a note taking app on there that I love
2014-09-14 12:53:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Right
2014-09-14 12:53:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're already invested in the Apple ecosystem
2014-09-14 12:53:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just stick with it
2014-09-14 12:53:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And play games 
2014-09-14 12:53:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you already know how to use everything and you know it works for you
2014-09-14 12:53:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it would be nice to have 2 different things open at once
2014-09-14 12:54:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which my current iPad can't do
2014-09-14 12:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is there a tablet that can do that?
2014-09-14 12:54:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]besides the Surface?
2014-09-14 12:54:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's actually what I'd buy
2014-09-14 12:54:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd get the Surface Pro
2014-09-14 12:54:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you're basically buying a computer at that point
2014-09-14 12:54:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's not what you need
2014-09-14 12:55:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All I know of is the surface I guess 
2014-09-14 12:55:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just assumed other tablets could do that too
2014-09-14 12:56:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I don't know
2014-09-14 12:57:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not really the person to talk to about this.
2014-09-14 12:57:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-14 12:57:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tablets are sort of a luxury item in my opinion
2014-09-14 12:57:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well my computer is so big
2014-09-14 12:58:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Taking it everywhere is a pain 
2014-09-14 12:58:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I should have said they would be a luxury item for me
2014-09-14 12:58:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can see why other people want them
2014-09-14 12:58:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they definitely aren't worth the price tag for me
2014-09-14 12:58:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I appreciated your input anyways lol
2014-09-14 13:11:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love these college football snap montages
2014-09-14 13:34:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I've never actually watched then before
2014-09-14 13:34:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty sweet
2014-09-14 13:38:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love youuuu
2014-09-14 13:38:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you still mad at me?
2014-09-14 13:40:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah
2014-09-14 13:41:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't even made until all your messages
2014-09-14 13:42:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'm sorry
2014-09-14 13:42:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should've just let you end the conversation there instead of pursuing it further 
2014-09-14 13:43:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-14 13:43:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not really the "pursuing it further"
2014-09-14 13:43:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right?
2014-09-14 13:43:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you opened with "yo fuck you"
2014-09-14 13:44:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]reaffirmed you thought it was "bad data analysis"
2014-09-14 13:44:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then said I didn't respect your opinion because you're a woman
2014-09-14 13:44:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The fuck you was totally uncalled for
2014-09-14 13:51:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think your project sounds really interesting, and I'm sure you'll do it excellently like you always do 
2014-09-14 13:52:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha thanks
2014-09-14 13:52:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dar can't find any MDMA
2014-09-14 13:53:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's ok 
2014-09-14 13:53:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you still want to go to that show we can.
2014-09-14 13:54:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm down with whatever
2014-09-14 13:55:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too
2014-09-14 13:55:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess we can make a game time decision 
2014-09-14 13:55:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-14 13:57:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you upset with me?
2014-09-14 13:57:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-09-14 13:58:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-09-14 13:58:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]any plans for today?
2014-09-14 14:02:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still feel like sometimes when I disagree with you, you don't actually respond to what I'm saying which makes me feel like my points are not being considered. I know you don't do that because I'm a woman though and even if I'm frustrated I shouldn't take it out on you. I was also upset that you interpreted what I was saying as being condescending, but maybe I was being condescending without realizing it.
2014-09-14 14:03:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anyways, no solid plans except maybe working on this R coursera course
2014-09-14 14:13:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you.
2014-09-14 14:14:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You sure?
2014-09-14 14:14:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I think so.
2014-09-14 14:15:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You think so??
2014-09-14 14:15:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh dear
2014-09-14 14:16:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-14 15:39:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Has that pic been mirror imaged already?
2014-09-14 15:39:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't remember if I flipped it
2014-09-14 16:37:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol
2014-09-14 16:37:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes I think it's been flipped
2014-09-14 16:37:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can't tell my left breast from my right?
2014-09-14 16:38:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha apparently not
2014-09-14 16:40:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you're saying that is the correct orientation, right?
2014-09-14 16:41:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When I look at it, it does not look like I'm looking in a mirror
2014-09-14 16:41:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-09-14 18:34:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]After 3 hours, I finished a programming assignment!
2014-09-14 18:34:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol
2014-09-14 18:34:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice!
2014-09-14 18:34:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what was the assignment?
2014-09-14 18:35:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was just various calculations on certain subsets of a directory of files
2014-09-14 18:36:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you had to combine data sets or something?
2014-09-14 18:38:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, or parse out information from different files 
2014-09-14 18:40:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now time for like 4 hours of Netflix 
2014-09-14 18:41:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you going to watch?
2014-09-14 18:41:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's just me 
2014-09-14 18:41:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Darcy is at D&D
2014-09-14 18:41:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sooo

2014-09-14 18:42:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can I watch more Masters of Sex?
2014-09-14 18:43:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We don't have to make that "our show"
2014-09-14 18:43:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-09-14 18:43:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can go ahead and watch without me
2014-09-14 18:43:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think we're gonna have one
2014-09-14 18:43:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I imagined we would wait and watch most if it together 
2014-09-14 18:44:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you're too impatient lol
2014-09-14 18:44:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so like when we see each other?
2014-09-14 18:44:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-14 18:44:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can do that
2014-09-14 18:45:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll pick a different show though, go ahead and watch masters 
2014-09-14 18:45:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I'll watch an episode too 
2014-09-14 18:45:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can wait if that's the plan
2014-09-14 19:01:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm watching one now
2014-09-14 20:00:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]can you call my phone?

2014-09-14 20:05:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what're you up to?
2014-09-14 20:06:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not much. Watching some Sunday Night Football.
2014-09-14 20:06:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what about you?
2014-09-14 20:10:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]cooking dinner
2014-09-14 20:10:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]just finished the episode where we learn Masters dad was abusive
2014-09-14 20:11:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What'd you think?
2014-09-14 20:16:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that ethan guy is kind of a jerk
2014-09-14 20:16:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and masters is pretty fucking creepy
2014-09-14 20:17:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we can watch the next one together (over hangouts) sometime if you want though
2014-09-14 20:31:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's your call
2014-09-14 20:32:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ethan still manages to get all kinds of pussy, though
2014-09-14 20:32:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you saying Masters is creepy because of the sleepwalking?
2014-09-14 20:33:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no, because he was listening to her ex husband describe how she is in bed
2014-09-14 20:33:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oooh haha
2014-09-14 20:34:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the perks of being a scientist I guess
2014-09-14 20:36:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm totally gonna be like George when you divorce me
2014-09-14 20:37:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]George was the old guy she danced with?
2014-09-14 20:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-14 20:37:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]her ex husband

2014-09-14 22:01:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I saw that on red sit
2014-09-14 22:01:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*reddit
2014-09-14 22:02:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty interesting, though not totally surprising 
2014-09-14 22:03:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There are some good critiques in the reddit comments.
2014-09-14 22:04:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also the topic of iud's has come up multiple times recently 
2014-09-14 22:04:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A way to almost definitely prevent pregnancy without having to use hormones 
2014-09-14 22:04:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-09-14 22:04:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean in conversations with people 
2014-09-14 22:05:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh. How do they work?
2014-09-14 22:05:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They plug up something so you can't get pregnant 
2014-09-14 22:05:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's surgical 
2014-09-14 22:05:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is it permanent?
2014-09-14 22:05:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-09-14 22:06:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can get it removed by a doctor 
2014-09-14 22:06:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Interesting.
2014-09-14 22:07:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you only have like 4 periods a year
2014-09-14 22:07:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How much does it cost?
2014-09-14 22:08:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It looks like $500 to insert, but most insurances cover part of it
2014-09-14 22:10:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's the surgery that keeps people away?
2014-09-14 22:10:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In the 70s, there were complications with infections 
2014-09-14 22:11:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that problem has been fixed with more stringent methods 
2014-09-14 22:11:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK.

2014-09-14 22:17:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it's getting held up
2014-09-14 22:18:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure that'll take off.

2014-09-14 22:18:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It'd be interesting to see whether STD rates change.

2014-09-14 23:07:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's hard to say, but you're probably right 
2014-09-14 23:13:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a long movie to start so late
2014-09-14 23:13:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not gonna watch the whole thing.

2014-09-15 00:34:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nuzzling 
2014-09-15 00:34:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And touch your neck.

2014-09-15 09:01:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I couldn't go to sleep until 2 last night 
2014-09-15 09:01:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So annoying
2014-09-15 09:02:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. Just weren't tired?
2014-09-15 09:03:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess
2014-09-15 09:03:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]one of those negative feedbacks where I get frustrated because I can't sleep and then it's harder for me to fall asleep 
2014-09-15 09:07:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, yeah that's the worst.
2014-09-15 09:09:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are you up to today?
2014-09-15 09:38:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a meeting at the field museum at 10
2014-09-15 09:39:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To get some bench space and card access
2014-09-15 09:39:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you on your way?
2014-09-15 09:39:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My badge is at school, so I made the mistake of driving to school so I could grab it and go
2014-09-15 09:40:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate parallel parking 
2014-09-15 09:40:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should've biked to school and back
2014-09-15 09:41:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, probably would've been easier. Oh, well.
2014-09-15 10:16:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhhhhh
2014-09-15 10:17:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I go to staff parking, and because they're having an event for the trustees today it's closed to everyone including staff
2014-09-15 10:17:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I had to park in the $20 parking
2014-09-15 10:18:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maaaan
2014-09-15 10:18:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry, sugar.
2014-09-15 10:31:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Andddd after 10 minute meeting I'm done
2014-09-15 10:32:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha I had a feeling that would happen
2014-09-15 10:32:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So might as well see the biomechanics exhibit lol
2014-09-15 10:33:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha hell yeah. Gotta justify that $20 somehow
2014-09-15 10:33:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]send me a snap, girlfriend
2014-09-15 11:38:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it'd be really fun to take a kid to a museum or aquarium 
2014-09-15 11:39:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it'd be fun to take a kid a lot of places
2014-09-15 11:39:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]shit just blows their minds
2014-09-15 11:42:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-09-15 11:42:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless they're sucky kids
2014-09-15 11:42:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-15 11:47:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I asked Hannah when I moved in if her mom had a bike I could have, and today she sent me a picture of the bike, so I decided to ask her about some drugs. It turns out she has an MDMA hookup in Dallas, but she's leaving today    😞 
2014-09-15 11:49:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We could've both gotten drugs from our exs!
2014-09-15 11:49:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I know
2014-09-15 11:53:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think she's aware that you're dating someone else?
2014-09-15 11:54:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]umm I would think so
2014-09-15 11:54:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had her blocked on my Facebook for a while
2014-09-15 11:54:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I guess I don't know how she would've known then
2014-09-15 11:55:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't know how she would know now
2014-09-15 11:55:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you like a lot of shit I post
2014-09-15 11:55:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had a public post about you being one of my favorite people
2014-09-15 11:56:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess she could probably see the pics from Montana too
2014-09-15 11:56:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as a friend of a friend
2014-09-15 11:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I guess it depends on how much she has been trying to pay attention to my life
2014-09-15 11:56:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why'd you block her
2014-09-15 11:57:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I blocked all my exes for a bit.
2014-09-15 11:57:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because I was still being reminded of them.
2014-09-15 11:57:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because our social circles overlapped so much.
2014-09-15 11:57:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I'd see whenever they liked something.
2014-09-15 11:57:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or pics they were in that mutual friends posted.
2014-09-15 11:59:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty healthy I guess
2014-09-15 11:59:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was definitely good for me
2014-09-15 12:00:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's crazy how like we can manipulate ourselves
2014-09-15 12:00:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was actually reading an article about will-power the other day
2014-09-15 12:00:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it was saying how people with strong will power are just good at tricking themselves
2014-09-15 12:00:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so like kids in that marshmallow experiment
2014-09-15 12:01:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where they put a marshmallow in front of a kid
2014-09-15 12:01:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then told them if they didn't eat it for 15 minutes they'd get a second one
2014-09-15 12:01:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](they found out that kids who waited ended up having higher SAT scores)
2014-09-15 12:01:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but, anyway,
2014-09-15 12:01:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the kids who were able to resist
2014-09-15 12:01:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would push it out of sight
2014-09-15 12:01:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or pretend like it was something gross
2014-09-15 12:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or sing a song to distract themselves
2014-09-15 12:02:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they weren't actually conquering the temptation
2014-09-15 12:02:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they were removing it
2014-09-15 12:09:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I've read about that study 
2014-09-15 12:10:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you think you have strong will power?
2014-09-15 12:10:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aka mental trickery 
2014-09-15 12:10:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when I have enough time to think about the temptation
2014-09-15 12:12:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what about you?
2014-09-15 12:13:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably not 
2014-09-15 12:14:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-15 12:14:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I do think I have pretty good dedication 
2014-09-15 12:14:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like sticking with something?
2014-09-15 12:16:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-09-15 12:16:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I guess those are different things 
2014-09-15 12:17:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I suppose they're kinda related.
2014-09-15 12:17:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If you stick with something, you're not being drawn away by something else
2014-09-15 17:51:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only 42 more hours!!
2014-09-15 17:52:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I am so effing ready.
2014-09-15 17:52:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I ran out a gel today and it looked pretty shitty
2014-09-15 17:53:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which might mean most of what I did last week needs to be redone 
2014-09-15 17:53:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man.
2014-09-15 17:53:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean "looked pretty shitty"
2014-09-15 17:53:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it could also mean the gel buffer was old
2014-09-15 17:53:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm gonna try it again tomorrow with new buffer 
2014-09-15 17:54:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to have a single bright clear band of high molecular weight DNA
2014-09-15 17:54:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And instead a lot of them looked smeary 
2014-09-15 17:54:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which usually means degraded DNA
2014-09-15 17:55:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what does degraded DNA mean
2014-09-15 17:56:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It means the DNA was broken into smaller fragments 
2014-09-15 17:56:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Either through tissue degradation from poo storage, or DNase contamination, or the DNA extraction method was not gentle enough 
2014-09-15 17:57:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]doesn't the DNA get chopped up anyway when you sequence, though?
2014-09-15 17:57:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If it's the latter, I can do stuff different to avoid that 
2014-09-15 17:57:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes, but you don't want it chopped up before you cut it 
2014-09-15 17:58:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You select DNA fragments of a certain size to be sequenced 
2014-09-15 17:59:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If a bunch of your genome is degraded to 200 bp before you even start, those won't be sequenced 
2014-09-15 18:01:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because they aren't the right size?
2014-09-15 18:01:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-15 18:03:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And so some samples will be missing loci that are present at other, nondegraded samples
2014-09-15 18:04:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that loci will essentially have to be thrown out if it's not well represented across samples 
2014-09-15 18:04:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because the degradation won't be random?
2014-09-15 18:04:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whereas the chopping is?
2014-09-15 18:04:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The chopping is based on restriction cut sites found at specific locations throughout the genome 
2014-09-15 18:05:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And so ideally you'll recover the same loci for each sample 
2014-09-15 18:05:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Degradation can make you lose loci
2014-09-15 18:06:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also degradation can mess up the ends of DNA, making them not bind to sequencing adapters as well
2014-09-15 18:08:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anyways, how was your day?
2014-09-15 18:08:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha eh not bad.
2014-09-15 18:08:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Getting a little more work in.
2014-09-15 18:09:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just gonna do 3 hours Tuesday and Wednesday
2014-09-15 18:11:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK, so is what you're doing different than what the people I was working with were doing?
2014-09-15 18:11:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It looks like they fragmented DNA randomly
2014-09-15 18:11:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then you use software to align it
2014-09-15 18:12:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you know what method they used?
2014-09-15 18:12:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't. I only know the software pipeline.
2014-09-15 18:13:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, the restriction sites are randomly dispersed through the genome. So it is random in that aspect. 
2014-09-15 18:13:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still have to align reads to contigs
2014-09-15 18:14:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word.
2014-09-15 18:17:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we're going to shoot for 1:30 meet at the hotel, yes?
2014-09-15 18:17:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep.
2014-09-15 18:18:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet
2014-09-15 18:18:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And checkin is at 2?
2014-09-15 18:18:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty sure
2014-09-15 18:18:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-09-15 18:19:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Should we call and see if we can checkin 30 min early? 
2014-09-15 18:19:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you think?
2014-09-15 18:19:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why not
2014-09-15 18:20:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe if they make a note if it it'll make sure the room is ready by then
2014-09-15 18:20:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If not, we can grab lunch nearby 
2014-09-15 18:20:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good
2014-09-15 18:21:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna have to walk like a mile and a half
2014-09-15 18:21:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-15 18:21:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really?
2014-09-15 18:21:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I could take a different route
2014-09-15 18:21:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Each time you take the shuttle to school?
2014-09-15 18:21:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh no
2014-09-15 18:21:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to get from my place to the hotel.
2014-09-15 18:22:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That route takes 32 minutes.
2014-09-15 18:22:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I have to walk like a 1.5 miles
2014-09-15 18:22:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I take two buses and a train
2014-09-15 18:22:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it takes 53 mins
2014-09-15 18:22:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I only have to walk like .3 miles
2014-09-15 18:23:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you look into taking a bike on the bus?
2014-09-15 18:23:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No. I don't think I really have to worry about it, right?
2014-09-15 18:26:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well then you don't have to walk 1.5 miles
2014-09-15 18:26:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can bike
2014-09-15 18:26:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh but then where will you store your bike 
2014-09-15 18:27:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah. And I'd have to stop at the hotel on the way back from the airport in that case too.
2014-09-15 18:27:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll be fine
2014-09-15 18:27:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll be waiting for you when you get there    😃 
2014-09-15 18:29:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:))))
2014-09-15 18:38:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the shit going down in the NFL is pretty interesting.
2014-09-15 18:39:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It seems to be capturing the moral crossroads America is going through.
2014-09-15 18:56:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's the crossroads?
2014-09-15 18:57:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Domestic abuse should or should not be swept under the rug?
2014-09-15 18:57:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There's three things
2014-09-15 18:57:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1) drugs used to be evil, seem to be ok now
2014-09-15 18:58:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Redskins
2014-09-15 18:58:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2) domestic abuse, I don't think it's been cool for a while now, but it's definitely bad now
2014-09-15 18:58:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]3) corporal punishment for kids - this still seems pretty controversial, but is clearly shifting away from hitting kids
2014-09-15 19:04:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And "redskins" is offensive
2014-09-15 19:04:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mostly to non native Americans 
2014-09-15 19:06:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I guess that isn't new. That one's kinda different too, because it's just political correctness.
2014-09-15 19:07:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But now there are pushes to boycott those games
2014-09-15 19:08:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The domestic abuse one is not so cut and dry either
2014-09-15 19:08:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Everyone suspected him of doing it, the NFL had the video months ago, and it wasn't until it leaked that they took action 
2014-09-15 19:09:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They still tried to keep it buried under the rug as long as they could
2014-09-15 19:11:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Most people aren't actually boycotting the Redskins and the name controversy isn't new  http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Redskins_name_controversy
2014-09-15 19:12:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I'm talking about the way the general public is reacting.
2014-09-15 19:12:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The NFL is acting the way it is to placate its fans
2014-09-15 19:13:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you were talking about how both the public and nfl have reacted to recent events
2014-09-15 19:13:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sooo the NFL says "people want to see their favorite players and don't seem to really care if they recreationally use drugs, we should change our drug policy"
2014-09-15 19:14:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-09-15 19:14:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm saying the NFL's reactions are a reflection of shifting public opinion
2014-09-15 19:14:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then they say "Holy shit, people are really upset about Ray Rice knocking his wife out, we should change our domestic abuse policy"
2014-09-15 19:14:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and now..
2014-09-15 19:15:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it seems like people might be divided
2014-09-15 19:15:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are in less of a universal uproar
2014-09-15 19:15:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]about Peterson hitting his kid
2014-09-15 19:15:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and so the Vikings reactivated him
2014-09-15 19:15:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because they think "people want to see their favorite player more than they care about him hitting his kid"
2014-09-15 19:19:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmmm
2014-09-15 19:19:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That is interesting 
2014-09-15 19:27:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where can I find quarters at this time of night?
2014-09-15 19:27:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't know. You're probably gonna have to get change from a place.
2014-09-15 19:27:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need like 8 quarters
2014-09-15 19:28:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe the kimbark laundromat?
2014-09-15 19:28:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd make sense
2014-09-15 19:28:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I never tried
2014-09-15 19:29:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my ESPN stream is struggling >:[
2014-09-15 19:29:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh nooo
2014-09-15 19:30:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need you to come give me kisses to make it okay
2014-09-15 19:30:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll be there for Wednesday night football 
2014-09-15 19:30:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh wait...
2014-09-15 19:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha we'll have Thursday night football!
2014-09-15 19:31:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I swear, if you're bad luck...
2014-09-15 19:31:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude
2014-09-15 19:31:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-09-15 19:31:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why even bring that up now
2014-09-15 19:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Miami totally got fucked while you were there
2014-09-15 19:31:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh God...
2014-09-15 19:31:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I won't be attending Auburn 
2014-09-15 19:32:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is unfair
2014-09-15 19:32:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If auburn loses, you'll automatically blame it on me
2014-09-15 19:32:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what other reason would they lose?
2014-09-15 19:32:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm so scared now
2014-09-15 19:35:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe someone else brought a bad luck SO to a bar somewhere in the US
2014-09-15 19:36:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]duude
2014-09-15 19:36:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]duuuude
2014-09-15 19:37:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Auburn lost the national championship the day I met you
2014-09-15 19:37:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or no
2014-09-15 19:37:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the Monday after I met you
2014-09-15 19:50:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude
2014-09-15 19:50:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't go to that game with you though 
2014-09-15 19:50:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe that's why they lost
2014-09-15 19:51:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe... or maybe you're bad luck vibes are just that strong
2014-09-15 19:51:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm hurt 
2014-09-15 19:51:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That you would automatically leap to that conclusion
2014-09-15 19:51:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just saying
2014-09-15 19:51:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we have two pieces of evidence
2014-09-15 19:52:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#1 Miami scandal
2014-09-15 19:52:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#2 Auburn losing natty
2014-09-15 19:53:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might need to tell my dad and brother so they can do a counter-jinx
2014-09-15 20:05:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a great way to integrate me into the family
2014-09-15 20:05:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tell them I'm bad football juju
2014-09-15 20:05:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just trying to be proactive.
2014-09-15 20:06:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just messing around, sugar.
2014-09-15 20:06:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it might be a good idea to do a counter jinx anyway
2014-09-15 20:07:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So many mixed signals in that last stream of messages lol
2014-09-15 20:07:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's their counter jinx?
2014-09-15 20:07:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't knkow
2014-09-15 20:07:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just acknowledging it can be enough
2014-09-15 20:09:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you getting some laundry done?
2014-09-15 20:09:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-09-15 20:09:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]getting the sexy panties ready?
2014-09-15 20:10:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though the kimbark laundry place had coin machines for customers only, and I couldn't break the rules lol 
2014-09-15 20:10:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought we were past sexy panties?
2014-09-15 20:10:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got my dependable granny panties ready!
2014-09-15 20:10:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I guess we are
2014-09-15 20:14:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just kiddinggg
2014-09-15 20:14:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like having an extra reason for my underwear to look good
2014-09-15 20:14:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I especially like looking good for you 
2014-09-15 20:15:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-09-15 20:15:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you me an extra reason for your underwear to look good?
2014-09-15 20:25:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well even if I wasn't seeing someone, I sometimes like to feel sexy
2014-09-15 20:45:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you bought any panties since we started dating?
2014-09-15 20:48:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-15 20:49:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you think about how I might like them?
2014-09-15 20:49:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some black ones to sleep in, that aren't as embarrassing as my old sleeping panties 
2014-09-15 20:49:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-15 20:49:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I bought some lacy boy shorts!
2014-09-15 20:50:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have I seen those?
2014-09-15 20:54:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]x-rated snap
2014-09-15 21:12:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm busy you
2014-09-15 21:12:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*busyyy
2014-09-15 21:12:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you've definitely seen them many times 
2014-09-15 21:13:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was warning you not requesting.
2014-09-15 21:16:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh my
2014-09-15 21:17:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Looking good on all fronts
2014-09-15 21:23:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did your football ever come back on?
2014-09-15 21:24:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I opted for The Great Gatsby at the half, though.
2014-09-15 21:24:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm a pretty big fan of this movie.
2014-09-15 21:43:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The Jack White version of "Love is Blindness" is so sick.
2014-09-15 22:10:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to?
2014-09-15 22:17:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was taking to my bro for like 45 min
2014-09-15 22:18:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice.
2014-09-15 22:18:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How's he doing?
2014-09-15 22:23:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He's good
2014-09-15 22:23:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Relatively unstressed 
2014-09-15 22:23:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which I hope continues 
2014-09-15 22:24:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not being stressed is good
2014-09-15 22:24:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I told him to buy a SWA flight for thanksgiving and if it looks like he won't make it to just move it to Xmas
2014-09-15 22:25:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did he sound like he would do it?
2014-09-15 22:29:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I think so
2014-09-15 22:29:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]His main hang up is he doesn't want a recording to somehow be scheduled for those days
2014-09-15 22:30:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But if it is he can cancel the flight at the last minute
2014-09-15 22:30:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-09-15 22:33:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you finish Gatsby?
2014-09-15 22:33:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]chyeah
2014-09-15 22:33:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I may owe that movie a rewatch
2014-09-15 22:33:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd be fun to watch on psychedelics
2014-09-15 22:34:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For sure. It's so long though
2014-09-15 22:34:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can get a little add on shrooms
2014-09-15 22:34:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah. I don't know if I'd want to dedicate that much of my trip to it.
2014-09-15 22:34:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tripping should be our next drug adventure
2014-09-15 22:35:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't tripped in a while.
2014-09-15 22:35:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Intentionally in a LONG time
2014-09-15 22:35:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just thinking that
2014-09-15 22:36:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have no idea where to get that stuff here though 
2014-09-15 22:36:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-09-15 22:37:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why are all the drugs I like so hard to get    😞 
2014-09-15 22:38:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this version of "Back to Black" from the movie is dirty
2014-09-15 22:40:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm actually I might know someone
2014-09-15 22:40:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like a friend of a friend 
2014-09-15 22:40:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-15 22:49:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's always so awkward trying to branch out to people like that though
2014-09-15 22:49:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess I haven't done it much
2014-09-15 22:51:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like "Hi, I know we've only met twice but can you get me acid."
2014-09-15 22:51:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah.
2014-09-15 22:52:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just want to be able to go to the store.
2014-09-15 22:52:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know
2014-09-15 22:52:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like alcohol.
2014-09-15 22:52:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder how often I'd do drugs if it was that easy.
2014-09-15 22:53:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it would've definitely improved my quality of life at times.
2014-09-15 22:54:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know if LSD by yourself when you're unhappy would make your life better 
2014-09-15 22:55:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't think so?
2014-09-15 22:55:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]life has been such a drag for me at times
2014-09-15 22:55:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would've loved to have had an outlet like that
2014-09-15 22:55:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I've had a couple pretty bad trips because my mental state wasn't in great shape 
2014-09-15 22:56:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that doesn't really scare me.
2014-09-15 22:56:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd rather go through a bad trip than sit hating my life for another weekend alone.
2014-09-15 22:56:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm
2014-09-15 22:57:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To each their own
2014-09-15 22:58:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe someday I'll have the option
2014-09-15 23:02:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If Elin finds acid I'll see if she can mail me a sheet
2014-09-15 23:03:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh!
2014-09-15 23:03:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haley did shrooms the other day
2014-09-15 23:04:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well where does she get them?
2014-09-15 23:04:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Her ex boyfriend
2014-09-15 23:04:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll ask
2014-09-15 23:06:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who'd she do them with?
2014-09-15 23:06:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Her ex and his friends 
2014-09-15 23:06:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh is she still hanging out with him?
2014-09-15 23:09:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah they're friends 
2014-09-15 23:09:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not her recent ex
2014-09-15 23:09:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, alright
2014-09-15 23:10:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe we should make a batch of LSD when we make our MDMA
2014-09-15 23:11:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'll just candy flip all the time and let you raise the kids
2014-09-15 23:11:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-15 23:11:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've actually never done that
2014-09-15 23:11:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but wanted to
2014-09-15 23:12:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love candy flipping 
2014-09-15 23:13:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like it'd be fun
2014-09-15 23:13:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why can't we candy flip together?
2014-09-15 23:14:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fob em off on the grandparents for a weekend 
2014-09-15 23:15:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is fob
2014-09-15 23:15:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]give?
2014-09-15 23:15:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-15 23:15:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]0/4
2014-09-15 23:15:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not bad
2014-09-15 23:16:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yeah, I hope we do that!
2014-09-15 23:17:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hope we do all kinds of shit. I have a lot of living to catch up on
2014-09-15 23:17:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's 0/4
2014-09-15 23:17:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you missed all four of the characters
2014-09-15 23:17:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in give
2014-09-15 23:18:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fob off is a legitimate slang term 
2014-09-15 23:18:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh
2014-09-15 23:18:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't know that
2014-09-15 23:18:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://idioms.thefreedictionary.com/_/dict.aspx?rd=1&word=fob+off
2014-09-15 23:19:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ncie
2014-09-15 23:19:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]never heard it in my life
2014-09-15 23:25:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Learn new things everyday 
2014-09-15 23:26:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]LSD seems a little trickier 
2014-09-15 23:26:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To make 
2014-09-15 23:26:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe we can grow some peyote
2014-09-15 23:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or psilocybin
2014-09-15 23:26:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a little psychedelic garden
2014-09-15 23:27:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know about peyote 
2014-09-15 23:27:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never tried it
2014-09-15 23:27:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've heard from 2 different dudes it made their dick stop working for months after
2014-09-15 23:28:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha what?
2014-09-15 23:28:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never tried it either
2014-09-15 23:28:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it sounds intense
2014-09-15 23:30:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like there's no way it causes your dick to work
2014-09-15 23:30:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to not work
2014-09-15 23:30:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean I guess it could
2014-09-15 23:30:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but indirectly
2014-09-15 23:30:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in that it fucked with your head abit
2014-09-15 23:33:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe
2014-09-15 23:34:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we should definitely have sex while tripping
2014-09-15 23:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess peyote does lower sex drive
2014-09-15 23:34:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so not on that
2014-09-15 23:35:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might go over like our sex on mdma
2014-09-15 23:35:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we can see if we want to!
2014-09-15 23:35:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think so?
2014-09-15 23:36:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Googling around
2014-09-15 23:37:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not being able to get hard/finish on MDMA is pretty common
2014-09-15 23:37:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I agree
2014-09-15 23:37:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I meant more how we didn't even feel like having sex
2014-09-15 23:37:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh maybe
2014-09-15 23:37:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like we were into do other stuff
2014-09-15 23:37:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I'd be way more interested then
2014-09-15 23:37:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the prospect of sex just wasn't particularly appealing, though
2014-09-15 23:38:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's hard to explain
2014-09-15 23:38:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz I want sex with you pretty much all the rest of the time
2014-09-15 23:38:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I feel like there wouldn't be something stopping me on LSD
2014-09-15 23:38:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think if we had taken a little less we might've been more sexual 
2014-09-15 23:38:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the I think the idea of having sex with you would be really crazy and exciting
2014-09-15 23:39:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-15 23:39:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-09-15 23:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like rolling that hard
2014-09-15 23:39:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know
2014-09-15 23:40:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just saying we might've been more sexual on less
2014-09-15 23:40:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok. Yeah, probably.
2014-09-15 23:40:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You said you've had sex while tripping before, right?
2014-09-15 23:41:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On shrooms
2014-09-15 23:41:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's fun?
2014-09-15 23:42:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-09-15 23:42:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It takes forever
2014-09-15 23:43:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And there's a lot of stopping and getting distracted
2014-09-15 23:43:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha hmm
2014-09-15 23:44:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe it would be like when we were rolling then
2014-09-15 23:44:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably shouldn't build it up in that case
2014-09-15 23:44:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-15 23:44:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the sex on MDMA didn't live up to the hype
2014-09-15 23:44:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean I'm not an expert on psychedelic sex 
2014-09-15 23:45:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of my n = 2 each time was really different 
2014-09-15 23:46:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it sounds like dudes are reporting it's a good time
2014-09-15 23:46:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]might as well give it a shot I suppose
2014-09-15 23:47:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel bad I didn't make sex on MDMA awesome for you
2014-09-15 23:47:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-15 23:48:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The sex on the come down was pretty great
2014-09-15 23:49:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-15 23:50:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And when you went down on me it felt really really good 
2014-09-15 23:50:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was actually really fun
2014-09-15 23:50:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's one of the more vivid memories I have of the night
2014-09-15 23:50:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah?
2014-09-15 23:51:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-15 23:51:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you were really into it
2014-09-15 23:51:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I remember you being really wet
2014-09-15 23:51:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and tasting you
2014-09-15 23:51:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and being completely into it
2014-09-15 23:51:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so we'll definitely do that again next time    😃 
2014-09-15 23:52:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did it feel good when I went down on you?
2014-09-15 23:53:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think so. I remember enjoying it.
2014-09-15 23:53:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But my dick is just kinda numb too.
2014-09-15 23:53:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should definitely suck my dick next time too, though
2014-09-15 23:54:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you want to try again, even if it didn't live up to the hype?
2014-09-15 23:54:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well I'm saying that now
2014-09-15 23:55:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess odds are I might not be that motivated
2014-09-15 23:55:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-09-15 23:55:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm trying to remember when we actually had sex
2014-09-15 23:55:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]before the come down
2014-09-15 23:55:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I kinda remember my dick just not being hard
2014-09-15 23:55:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-15 23:56:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We just stuck it in a couple times
2014-09-15 23:56:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I wouldn't even be able to really do anything I don't think
2014-09-15 23:56:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it wasn't hard enough
2014-09-15 23:56:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But if we took less....
2014-09-15 23:56:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you got me pretty hard when you were down on me right?
2014-09-15 23:57:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha but what if the roll isn't as good?
2014-09-15 23:57:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never had like a between roll
2014-09-15 23:57:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's either not enough
2014-09-15 23:57:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and kinda shitty
2014-09-15 23:57:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or balls to the wall
2014-09-15 23:57:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess how does it enhance it for you?
2014-09-15 23:58:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like you're more into the other person emotionally you siad
2014-09-15 23:58:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess if we're together and naked, how could it be a bad time?
2014-09-15 23:58:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe you can take a low dose sometime and I won't roll
2014-09-15 23:59:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well i guess in that case
2014-09-15 23:59:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you might as well take a full dose
2014-09-15 23:59:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz it doesn't seem to inhibit your sex drive
2014-09-15 23:59:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or you can try a lower foes than last time?
2014-09-15 23:59:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fiiiine
2014-09-16 00:00:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you're thinking I'm going to be rolling
2014-09-16 00:00:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not hard enough to inhibit my sex drive?
2014-09-16 00:00:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-16 00:00:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I've never had that happen
2014-09-16 00:00:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe not balls to the wall
2014-09-16 00:00:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I don't know what that'd be like
2014-09-16 00:02:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's up to you obviously 
2014-09-16 00:02:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much less would you have to take
2014-09-16 00:02:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to get the effect you're going for
2014-09-16 00:03:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess if we had some extra on hand
2014-09-16 00:03:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that if it wasn't working
2014-09-16 00:03:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could up the dose
2014-09-16 00:03:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd be down
2014-09-16 00:03:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha ok we'll do that 
2014-09-16 00:03:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which obviously we would if we were at home
2014-09-16 00:05:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to do drugssssssss
2014-09-16 00:06:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if Hannah is in Dallas again will she let you know about her contact?
2014-09-16 00:06:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she said she comes up once amonth
2014-09-16 00:06:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and to let her know if I ever wanted anything
2014-09-16 00:07:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anything??
2014-09-16 00:07:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha just kidding 
2014-09-16 00:08:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll talk to Haley too
2014-09-16 00:09:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I we could get coke for the Halloween party
2014-09-16 00:09:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what does that say?
2014-09-16 00:09:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we could get coke
2014-09-16 00:10:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-16 00:10:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be fun.
2014-09-16 00:10:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are the odds of us having sex in the bathroom if we're both on coke?
2014-09-16 00:10:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno 
2014-09-16 00:10:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you drink and do coke right
2014-09-16 00:11:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's something people do, yes
2014-09-16 00:11:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm asking you
2014-09-16 00:11:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude, that's dangerous!
2014-09-16 00:12:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that was a drug abuse site
2014-09-16 00:14:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've always been pretty careful about not getting wasted or doing a lot of coke
2014-09-16 00:14:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like at the same time?
2014-09-16 00:14:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-16 00:15:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to die 
2014-09-16 00:15:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that actually makes it even more surprising you hate on heroin
2014-09-16 00:15:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when that shit is pretty dangerous it looks like
2014-09-16 00:15:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what would we do at the party then?
2014-09-16 00:15:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just drink and occasionally take bumps?
2014-09-16 00:16:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I snort a line will I feel awesome?
2014-09-16 00:16:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know
2014-09-16 00:17:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll have to try it yourself of you want 
2014-09-16 00:17:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll feel goid
2014-09-16 00:17:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]were those answers to my questions?
2014-09-16 00:18:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They were all answers to the last question 
2014-09-16 00:18:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-09-16 00:18:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I guess we'd take some bumps throughout the night
2014-09-16 00:19:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and drink the rest of the time?
2014-09-16 00:19:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't have to drink if you don't want to
2014-09-16 00:19:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm asking what you would do
2014-09-16 00:19:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never done coke before
2014-09-16 00:19:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is your area
2014-09-16 00:20:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd drink (a little less than last year)
2014-09-16 00:20:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Take a line before going 
2014-09-16 00:21:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And take a little bump every hourish if I feel like it
2014-09-16 00:21:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. That sounds like a plan.
2014-09-16 00:21:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pumped.
2014-09-16 00:22:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm excited to see what a coked up Michael is like
2014-09-16 00:27:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'll be fun
2014-09-16 00:27:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I almost forgot about my laundry!
2014-09-16 00:31:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess ODing isn't really a risk?
2014-09-16 00:35:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of course it's a risk
2014-09-16 00:36:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's why I don't do a bunch of lines at once
2014-09-16 00:37:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm saying you have a sense for what is a lot.
2014-09-16 00:37:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I don't go overboard of I really like it.
2014-09-16 00:39:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah we'll be fine  
2014-09-16 00:40:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Plus the amount you do at one time does not increase linearly with how good it feels 
2014-09-16 00:40:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It plateaus pretty quickly I feel line
2014-09-16 00:40:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*like
2014-09-16 00:41:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-09-16 00:42:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Should be fun.
2014-09-16 00:42:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All this drug talk and we're not doing any this weekend... what a drag.
2014-09-16 00:45:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll just have to enjoy each other's company sober
2014-09-16 00:45:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Noooo
2014-09-16 00:47:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm gonna try to go to sleep. Goodnight. I love you.
2014-09-16 00:48:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Night
2014-09-16 00:49:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You alright?
2014-09-16 00:50:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, sorry I didn't mean that to sound dismissive 
2014-09-16 00:50:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you too 
2014-09-16 00:51:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I felt a little interrogated about drugs for almost 2 hours
2014-09-16 00:51:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha bull shit.
2014-09-16 00:51:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it's something you're excited about, it get that 
2014-09-16 00:55:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, don't ask what I'm thinking of you're going to call bullshit on the response 
2014-09-16 00:56:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was saying bull shit to you not meaning it to sound dismissive and I was right.
2014-09-16 00:57:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Passive aggressive is just too easssyyy with texting lol
2014-09-16 00:58:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess.
2014-09-16 00:58:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do love you though, and I am going to sleep. Goodnight, I love you, I'm very excited to one day so lots of drugs with you
2014-09-16 00:59:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And incredibly excited to only have 2 more nights without you lying next to me
2014-09-16 01:24:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah
2014-09-16 01:24:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Looks like I'm in for another sleepless night 
2014-09-16 08:30:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:(
2014-09-16 08:33:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]One more night and we'll both be sleeping great wrapped up in each other.
2014-09-16 09:58:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://benanne.github.io/2014/08/05/spotify-cnns.html
2014-09-16 10:00:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this guy did basically exactly what I wanted to do for my project and got a publication and an internship with Spotify out iof it
2014-09-16 10:00:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm a little bitter
2014-09-16 10:13:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not completely the same, because he was effectively doing supervised learning using clusters based on user's listening habits as a ground truth
2014-09-16 11:15:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's neat, but I think there's still plenty of room for exploring that realm of data with different methods
2014-09-16 11:18:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean? I'm open to ideas because I was just gonna look into something else.
2014-09-16 11:20:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well
2014-09-16 11:20:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I don't know haha
2014-09-16 11:20:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just woke up
2014-09-16 11:21:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except not starting with a ground truth?
2014-09-16 11:21:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you get similar results without starting with clusters?
2014-09-16 11:22:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I was thinking that, but the novelty is definitely considerably diminished. If I can't think of something else I might stick with that.
2014-09-16 11:22:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It goes to show you're coming up with viably interesting ideas though!
2014-09-16 11:23:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He also used 30 second intervals from the middle of songs, whereas I would be actively looking for a "hook", which may or may not be more representative of the song.
2014-09-16 11:23:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How late did you end up staying up?
2014-09-16 11:24:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]2:30ish
2014-09-16 11:24:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't set an alarm lol
2014-09-16 11:25:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well at least you're rested now.
2014-09-16 11:26:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I can check in to my flight!
2014-09-16 11:26:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)))
2014-09-16 11:26:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So excited!
2014-09-16 11:26:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I totally stole the multiple smile smiley face from you.
2014-09-16 11:27:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or I guess learned it from you.
2014-09-16 11:29:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think our texting and some talking mannerisms are definitely rubbing off on each other
2014-09-16 11:29:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah? Any examples come to mind?
2014-09-16 11:31:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You say yo sometimes
2014-09-16 11:32:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've started responding (to you and others) with "Yeah?"
2014-09-16 11:32:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Something you do a lot
2014-09-16 11:32:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's pretty interesting
2014-09-16 11:35:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have to get up sooo early tomorrow 
2014-09-16 11:35:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what time?
2014-09-16 11:35:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]should I call the hotel today?
2014-09-16 11:35:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] If I pack the night before, at least 5:30a
2014-09-16 11:35:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure
2014-09-16 11:36:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ick
2014-09-16 11:36:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is there an afternoon nap coming our way?
2014-09-16 11:36:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obvs 
2014-09-16 11:37:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll sleep on the 1st flight though
2014-09-16 11:37:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha can't wait  😘   
2014-09-16 11:38:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know
2014-09-16 11:38:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In feeling so lazy today though 
2014-09-16 11:38:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have to re do some lab stuff?
2014-09-16 11:39:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-16 11:39:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Optimizing is such a drag 
2014-09-16 11:40:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is that referring to?
2014-09-16 11:40:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you gotta keep the molecular stuff at a 3rd grade level for me
2014-09-16 11:42:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just changing little aspects of the default methods to get better results and figure out what went wrong with the first round. 
2014-09-16 11:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, makes sense. Yeah, I'm sure that can be tedious.
2014-09-16 11:43:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to redo the gel electrophoresis with all new buffers 1st though and hope that was the issue
2014-09-16 11:44:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Here's my gel 
2014-09-16 11:44:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks smeared
2014-09-16 11:45:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The lanes on the far left that look different than all the others are the "ladders"
2014-09-16 11:46:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They let you know what size DNA fragment a certain position is
2014-09-16 11:46:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And they look pretty wonky too
2014-09-16 11:47:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm well hopefully swapping out the buffer works I guess
2014-09-16 11:48:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you have a sense of what to try next if that doesn't work?
2014-09-16 11:51:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Redo some of the same extractions and either omit most of the vortexing steps
2014-09-16 11:51:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or else extract new tissues and see if maybe it was an issue with some of these samples in particular 
2014-09-16 11:52:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-09-16 12:29:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm stillllll in beddddd
2014-09-16 12:29:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha transport me to youuuuuuuuuuu
2014-09-16 12:29:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Working on it
2014-09-16 12:30:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I'll just do the lab work Sunday afternoon at the field 
2014-09-16 12:30:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They definitely have fresh buffer 
2014-09-16 12:31:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I don't have to go borrow anyone's equipment like I do on campus 
2014-09-16 12:35:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Boooo
2014-09-16 12:48:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Whaaaat

2014-09-16 12:57:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No they rescheduled it to when I'm in Vegas 
2014-09-16 12:58:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But Haley and I were talking about getting a group together before it gets too cold
2014-09-16 12:58:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe Molly and her bf, Christina,  Kate and Justin, and us
2014-09-16 13:00:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'd either do it that weekend or the weekend after
2014-09-16 13:00:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But obvs I'd like for you to come with

2014-09-16 15:15:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She apologized by saying, "oh I've let things get piled up"
2014-09-16 15:16:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She was a grad student not too long ago, 
2014-09-16 15:16:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I know her.
2014-09-16 15:16:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know
2014-09-16 15:16:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just meant she should remember what it's like 
2014-09-16 15:17:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh yeah. For sure
2014-09-16 15:17:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you need actual money for at this point?
2014-09-16 15:17:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Does our rental charge by the mile?
2014-09-16 15:17:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably.
2014-09-16 15:17:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Charge extra 
2014-09-16 15:20:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm actually not sure.
2014-09-16 15:34:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was sort of flirting with the idea of surprising my mom and staying there Friday-Saturday. 
2014-09-16 15:34:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The receipt says "unlimited mileage" with no mention of a cost per mile, so I don't know.
2014-09-16 15:34:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that would probably not be the visit you had in mind
2014-09-16 15:35:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd totally be down.
2014-09-16 15:36:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You sure?
2014-09-16 15:37:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What time dies your Friday class get out? 
2014-09-16 15:51:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh and in answer to your question, I need cash to pay for a book we're reading in EvProcesses and for a deans council event ticket 
2014-09-16 15:54:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah for sure.
2014-09-16 15:55:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How do I find out what the cost per mile is?
2014-09-16 15:55:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If it says unlimited then I think there is none
2014-09-16 15:55:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We could ask?
2014-09-16 15:56:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, we need to call the hotel and see if we can cancel our reservation just for Friday.
2014-09-16 15:58:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha clever girl.
2014-09-16 15:58:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It looks like most don't, but we can ask too.
2014-09-16 15:59:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Most don't what? Charge per mile?
2014-09-16 15:59:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can you call? I'm in class.
2014-09-16 15:59:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yes.
2014-09-16 16:00:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Forward me the hotel reservation email 
2014-09-16 16:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*sassy comment because I already forwarded it to you*
2014-09-16 16:06:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ask about checking in at 1:30 too!
2014-09-16 16:20:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude send stuff to my uchicago one
2014-09-16 16:21:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gmail deletes off of my phone and off of the gmail server when I get mail through my computer 
2014-09-16 16:40:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why do you have it set up to do that?
2014-09-16 16:41:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not really sure how to unset it
2014-09-16 16:41:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. Well I sent it for the third time.
2014-09-16 16:42:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I got it! I was just saying for future emails 
2014-09-16 16:43:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry 
2014-09-16 16:45:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So the email only sits on your hard drive?
2014-09-16 16:45:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or is it on an Apple server?
2014-09-16 16:45:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's on my laptop harddrive 
2014-09-16 16:46:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know how that doesn't drive you crazy.
2014-09-16 16:47:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It dies
2014-09-16 16:47:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*does
2014-09-16 16:48:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Then fix that shit! Haha
2014-09-16 16:50:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought I had
2014-09-16 16:51:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have "remove copy from server after retrieving message" unchecked
2014-09-16 16:54:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm I'd have to take a look at it.
2014-09-16 16:57:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://support.google.com/mail/answer/78892?hl=en
2014-09-16 16:57:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Make sure all your devices have the right settings.
2014-09-16 17:01:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It doesn't even give me those options in "mailbox behavior"
2014-09-16 17:02:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lame. Is there any reason you have to have the emails go through your Mac client?
2014-09-16 17:02:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a POP account
2014-09-16 17:02:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK.
2014-09-16 17:04:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Google seems to think IMAP is better.
2014-09-16 17:05:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You might need to configure some settings on the Gmail side too.
2014-09-16 17:14:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I fixed it!
2014-09-16 17:14:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hooray!
2014-09-16 17:16:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The hotel said they'd call me back and they haven't yet
2014-09-16 17:23:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send me a gmail 
2014-09-16 17:42:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what did they say they'd call you back about?
2014-09-16 17:43:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and how long ago was that?
2014-09-16 18:10:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how long did it take them to call you back/
2014-09-16 18:10:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I ended up calling them back
2014-09-16 18:10:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ugh
2014-09-16 18:11:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt this is gonna get taken care of tonight then
2014-09-16 18:11:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok well if they call you, answer 
2014-09-16 18:11:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have to shower
2014-09-16 18:12:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go shower then!
2014-09-16 18:12:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they said they'd call me back!
2014-09-16 18:12:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Take you phone into the shower 
2014-09-16 18:13:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm charging it off because I had no battery left and I'm gonna need it until late probably.
2014-09-16 18:13:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I"ll just shower.
2014-09-16 18:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh well

2014-09-16 18:31:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-09-16 18:31:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think this is gonna get changed.
2014-09-16 18:31:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They already agreed to take Friday off 
2014-09-16 18:32:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She said she was processing it 
2014-09-16 18:32:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it hasn't happened.
2014-09-16 18:32:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought you said you couldn't do anything?
2014-09-16 18:32:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She said she would do it but you had to call and confirm 
2014-09-16 18:33:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK well the lady I talked to didn't seem to know anything about it and said she'd call me back.
2014-09-16 18:33:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you ask to speak to the manager?
2014-09-16 18:33:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-16 18:33:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well then you didn't do what I said
2014-09-16 18:34:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go have fun
2014-09-16 18:34:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What?
2014-09-16 18:35:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If they call you, then answer and say the manager already agreed to change the reservation to wed-Friday with you're girlfriend, you were just calling to confirm
2014-09-16 18:35:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she said the manager stepped outside
2014-09-16 18:35:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm on hold
2014-09-16 18:36:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well don't miss your bus!

2014-09-16 18:55:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A couple different venues I think. Downtown Dallas so it should be fun.

2014-09-16 19:37:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't own any orange that isn't Miami stuff :/
2014-09-16 19:41:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We're navy too, but you can wear Miami stuff if you want. I wore Auburn stuff to the Mizzou bar.

2014-09-17 00:32:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We shouldn't video, then I definitely won't be able to sleep!
2014-09-17 00:32:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I already packed though (a Katherine Silliman 1st)
2014-09-17 00:33:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fiiine.

2014-09-17 01:05:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](my phone died, just got home)
2014-09-17 01:05:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP](I figured)

2014-09-17 01:05:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you have fun?

2014-09-17 01:06:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool
2014-09-17 01:06:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That snap looked pretty crazy 
2014-09-17 01:06:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha did it?
2014-09-17 01:06:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was definitely crowded.
2014-09-17 01:06:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it was a smaller venue.
2014-09-17 01:06:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]People were having a good time, though.
2014-09-17 01:07:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you use up all of your dancing??
2014-09-17 01:07:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]most of it    😕 
2014-09-17 01:07:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]://////////((((((((;((,(
2014-09-17 01:07:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahahaha
2014-09-17 01:08:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just kidding.
2014-09-17 01:08:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure if the Beauty Bar thing is gonna happen or not, but I'd still be down with going with you if you want.
2014-09-17 01:09:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll look up their music and see what's up
2014-09-17 01:09:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]An hour public transport sounds pretty brutal 
2014-09-17 01:10:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it's not ideal
2014-09-17 01:10:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How much was the über?
2014-09-17 01:10:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fucking pricey man!
2014-09-17 01:10:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$36.41
2014-09-17 01:10:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woah
2014-09-17 01:10:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she didn't take me home first, though
2014-09-17 01:10:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I thought I had made clear
2014-09-17 01:10:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]19.82 miles
2014-09-17 01:10:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]32:01 minues
2014-09-17 01:11:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or 32:01 for the time
2014-09-17 01:11:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not really minutes
2014-09-17 01:11:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]32 minutes and 1 second
2014-09-17 01:11:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess $36 makes sense in that case
2014-09-17 01:11:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Still sucks
2014-09-17 01:11:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah well I'm splitting it with Ajay
2014-09-17 01:11:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's nice at least
2014-09-17 01:11:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still
2014-09-17 01:11:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]By the way
2014-09-17 01:11:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's uh-JAY
2014-09-17 01:12:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he let me know I've been pronouncing it wrong for the past year today
2014-09-17 01:12:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-09-17 01:12:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's kinda funny
2014-09-17 01:12:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I was trying it to say it the right way.
2014-09-17 01:13:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he always introduces himself as AY-JAY
2014-09-17 01:13:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is clearly anglicized
2014-09-17 01:13:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](to white people)
2014-09-17 01:13:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know what that word means 
2014-09-17 01:13:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or I guess I should say Americans
2014-09-17 01:13:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]anglicized doesn't imply white
2014-09-17 01:14:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it implies English speaking
2014-09-17 01:14:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which includes Indians
2014-09-17 01:14:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but he makes it more American I guess
2014-09-17 01:14:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]anyway
2014-09-17 01:14:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]uh-Jay
2014-09-17 01:14:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]uh-JAY

2014-09-17 01:14:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty hard for me to say
2014-09-17 01:15:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we told Kate that, and she had to have him repeat it a couple of times
2014-09-17 01:15:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the Auburn girl I know
2014-09-17 01:15:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Southern people are all about emphasizing the first syllable 
2014-09-17 01:15:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]PO-lice
2014-09-17 01:15:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]DE-troit

2014-09-17 01:16:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]orange is like two syllables for Southern people
2014-09-17 01:16:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or-ange
2014-09-17 01:17:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you know a lot of the ppl who went?
2014-09-17 01:17:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there were maybe... ten?

2014-09-17 01:32:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I've been brainwashed by these emojis

2014-09-17 01:33:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]emojis are sort of playful and childish to begin with
2014-09-17 01:33:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Poor detail quality on facial features 
2014-09-17 01:33:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I don't get that criticism

2014-09-17 01:52:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sounds violent

2014-09-17 11:12:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're such a nut
2014-09-17 11:13:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok maybe once a year
2014-09-17 11:13:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was about to say
2014-09-17 11:13:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure there will come a time when you'll think you need it in your life
2014-09-17 11:13:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously
2014-09-17 11:13:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]#nowillpower
2014-09-17 11:13:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like tomorrow
2014-09-17 11:17:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah, that's reserved for in & out
2014-09-17 11:22:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm missing like the last perfect weather of Chicago for thunderstorms everyday
2014-09-17 11:22:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Boo
2014-09-17 11:23:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should probably just go back
2014-09-17 11:23:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and dude
2014-09-17 11:23:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your weather is wrong
2014-09-17 11:23:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]10% chance of rain today
2014-09-17 11:23:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]50% tomorrow
2014-09-17 11:23:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]10% Friday
2014-09-17 11:23:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]10% Saturday
2014-09-17 11:24:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude it said 50% on weather underground too!
2014-09-17 11:33:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except Friday 
2014-09-17 11:36:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On plane #2!
2014-09-17 11:36:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yay!
2014-09-17 11:37:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you opt for the route that requires 1.5 miles of walking?
2014-09-17 11:38:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-17 11:38:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm doing bus-train-bus
2014-09-17 11:38:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because that's what you have to do to travel < 3 miles in Dallas by public transit
2014-09-17 11:41:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you're transit now involves less walking but is 20 min longer?
2014-09-17 11:41:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-09-17 11:42:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're silly
2014-09-17 11:42:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-09-17 11:42:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's hot in texas
2014-09-17 11:42:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not trying to walk 1.5 miles with a duffle bag
2014-09-17 11:42:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's 83 with 65% humidity
2014-09-17 11:45:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-09-17 11:45:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you remember to pack swim trunks?
2014-09-17 11:46:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yep! I need to remember to pack sunscreen! I bet I forget.
2014-09-17 11:47:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sunscreen!
2014-09-17 11:47:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm taking off, see you soon love! 
2014-09-17 11:47:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you out my name on the reservation when you called?
2014-09-17 11:47:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yesss 😘😘😘😘😘
2014-09-17 11:47:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so, lol.
2014-09-17 11:48:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Actually, I think I did. I think she asked me.
2014-09-17 11:50:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-09-17 11:51:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I may beat you
2014-09-17 11:51:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I get an uber quickly
2014-09-17 11:51:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah maybe. I think I'm supposed to get there at 1:15
2014-09-17 12:46:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Landed!
2014-09-17 12:48:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet. Yeah you'll probably beat me.
2014-09-17 12:49:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've probably got 25 minutes.
2014-09-17 12:50:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you have lunch?
2014-09-17 12:51:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No.
2014-09-17 12:51:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you hungry?
2014-09-17 12:52:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nvm I'll wait 
2014-09-17 12:52:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was gonna grab something from the food court for us
2014-09-17 12:52:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK. It's your call.
2014-09-17 13:00:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My lyft driver is a n00b
2014-09-17 13:01:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I feel like they're all n00bs
2014-09-17 13:01:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uber required you to get a limo from airport though
2014-09-17 13:01:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that's more expensive 
2014-09-17 13:02:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why?
2014-09-17 13:02:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno
2014-09-17 13:02:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe something with airport contracts?
2014-09-17 13:02:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like they picked you up from the limo stand 
2014-09-17 13:03:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But why would Lyft be okay then?
2014-09-17 13:03:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno
2014-09-17 13:04:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm like ten minutes away.
2014-09-17 13:04:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I havent been picked up yet 
2014-09-17 13:04:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He can't find passenger pickup 
2014-09-17 13:05:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also this airport is weird
2014-09-17 13:05:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I've only been to it once.
2014-09-17 13:06:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I guess you'll get a lot more familiar with it soon!
2014-09-17 13:08:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No doubt.
2014-09-17 13:19:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]8 min!
2014-09-17 13:20:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice! The check-in lady said they'd have to check for availability, so do you just want to grab lunch?
2014-09-17 13:20:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure
2014-09-17 13:20:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or should I check in?
2014-09-17 13:23:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Up to you!
2014-09-17 13:23:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you're hungry, we should eat now
2014-09-17 13:23:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty hungry.
2014-09-17 13:24:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's eat
2014-09-17 13:24:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then we can have dessert 
2014-09-17 13:24:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. See you soon!
2014-09-17 13:24:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP];)))
2014-09-17 13:24:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-09-17 13:28:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He missed the exit  😿😿😿
2014-09-17 13:28:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Of course.
2014-09-17 13:28:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You shouldn't have to pay for those miles.
2014-09-17 13:29:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How do I say that?
2014-09-17 13:30:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lesson learned, I should've just gotten a shuttle 
2014-09-17 13:31:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just ask if he can take off those minutes/miles
2014-09-17 13:31:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or she
2014-09-17 13:32:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you said he
2014-09-19 13:35:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In the library, lemme know when you're done and I'll meet you by the car or w/e
2014-09-19 13:38:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll meet you at the library. My class is close.
2014-09-19 13:40:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool
2014-09-19 13:40:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I forgot headphones ://
2014-09-19 13:53:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]💩
2014-09-19 14:13:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Where are you? I've got 15 minutes.
2014-09-19 14:28:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh no
2014-09-19 14:28:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Library
2014-09-19 14:29:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did I miss you?
2014-09-19 14:29:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:((
2014-09-19 14:58:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I have my phone on vibrate now so I won't miss it
2014-09-19 15:29:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm out.
2014-09-19 15:30:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K I'm sitting on the wooden stairs across from the library 
2014-09-19 15:30:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In front of the student union
2014-09-21 07:45:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lyft drivers get reimbursed for tolls, so we should have definitely taken the tollway.
2014-09-21 07:46:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what I was saying!
2014-09-21 07:46:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe uber has a different policy though?
2014-09-21 07:46:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha my bad!
2014-09-21 07:48:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww
2014-09-21 07:48:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-09-21 07:49:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She doesn't know about the flagrant booty grabbing
2014-09-21 07:51:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's how I show my respect! ;)
2014-09-21 07:51:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]#respectdabooty
2014-09-21 09:11:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In Htown 
2014-09-21 09:11:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hope you're asleep my dear!
2014-09-21 09:13:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool. Miss you already.
2014-09-21 09:13:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not asleep, but I definitely would be if you were here.
2014-09-21 09:13:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to?
2014-09-21 09:14:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have King Kong on, seeing if I'll fall asleep or not.
2014-09-21 09:16:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I might've fallen asleep in the theaters for that one
2014-09-21 09:16:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have full confidence in you
2014-09-21 09:16:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha really? Is that something you do?
2014-09-21 09:17:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not often 
2014-09-21 09:17:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But sometimes if I'm sleepy and it's a long movie 
2014-09-21 09:19:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha word.
2014-09-21 09:32:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm gonna invest in one of those neck pillows 
2014-09-21 09:33:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Shaped like a C
2014-09-21 11:29:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fell back asleep. I think that'd be a worthwhile investment for you, though, assuming it made sleeping on planes easier for you.
2014-09-21 12:24:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Back in Chicago 
2014-09-21 12:24:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK, now come back.
2014-09-21 12:24:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll see if I can hide out in the lavatory 
2014-09-21 12:24:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our flight attendant was pretty funny, hopefully you get her on one of your visits 
2014-09-21 12:25:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's cool. Did she say anything she might use on multiple flights?
2014-09-21 12:26:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Before the safety presentation, she said "You probably saw her in 
2014-09-21 12:26:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the terminal, but Sandra Bullock is riding with us today at the front of the plane"
2014-09-21 12:26:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Totally believable
2014-09-21 12:26:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But then she said "made you look" 
2014-09-21 12:27:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's pretty good
2014-09-21 12:27:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And since she lives in Austin part time, it's not totally ridiculous
2014-09-21 12:28:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She also sang as we were landing a song about SWA loving it's customers and their money lol
2014-09-21 12:29:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that definitely seems more entertaining than your typical flight
2014-09-21 12:29:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What've you been up to since your nap?
2014-09-21 12:29:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not much. Watching the Cowboys now and just made some pasta salad.
2014-09-21 12:30:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The infamous and mysterious pasta salad 
2014-09-21 12:30:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought I was gonna walk to McDonald's for some breakfast burritos, but that didn't end up happening.
2014-09-21 12:30:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yep
2014-09-21 12:32:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cowboys stink, Katherine.
2014-09-21 12:33:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck da cowboys
2014-09-21 12:41:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why don't you already have one of those neck pillows?
2014-09-21 12:41:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That seems safely in the realm of impulse buy for you.
2014-09-21 13:54:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well up until recently I've been able to curl up in a ball no problem
2014-09-21 13:55:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but no longer    😕 
2014-09-21 13:55:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]getting old?
2014-09-21 13:56:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess
2014-09-21 13:56:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and realizing the legitimate fear of blood clots
2014-09-21 13:56:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]want to look at my programming assignment?
2014-09-21 13:56:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sure!
2014-09-21 13:59:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]can you see those?
2014-09-21 14:00:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-21 14:01:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]https://github.com/ksil91/ProgrammingAssignment2/blob/master/cachematrix.R
2014-09-21 14:16:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]wellll?
2014-09-21 14:16:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why do you use "%*%"
2014-09-21 14:17:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh, solve was giving me an error so I tried that to fix it but it ended up being a different issue
2014-09-21 14:17:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]does it affect my result?
2014-09-21 14:18:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they are doing different things
2014-09-21 14:18:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just using solve should return the inverse
2014-09-21 14:19:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the %*% operator does a matrix product
2014-09-21 14:19:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which would give you the identity matrix I guess
2014-09-21 14:20:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh. yeah
2014-09-21 14:20:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but otherwise?
2014-09-21 14:20:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but everything else seems correct, it's pretty parallel to the example
2014-09-21 14:20:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had to look at the example for a while to see what they were doing
2014-09-21 14:21:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah, that's why I thought I might be missing something
2014-09-21 14:21:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't done real object-oriented stuff in R
2014-09-21 14:29:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]word
2014-09-21 14:29:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]kinda interesting, but I'm not sure how useful it is
2014-09-21 14:29:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's an invertible matrix so I can test this code
2014-09-21 14:29:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-21 14:29:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]any square matrix?
2014-09-21 14:29:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have no idea lol
2014-09-21 14:30:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no not all matrices are invertible
2014-09-21 14:30:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's why they say that you can assume the ones that they'll give you are
2014-09-21 14:30:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]they said square matrices are 
2014-09-21 14:32:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]they didn't really give us a test line
2014-09-21 14:32:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]which is kinda silly
2014-09-21 14:32:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm testing it
2014-09-21 14:32:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not all square matrices are invertible
2014-09-21 14:32:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just an FYI
2014-09-21 14:32:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha noted
2014-09-21 14:35:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A <- matrix(c(0,1,4,1,0,-3,2,3,8), nrow = 3, ncol = 3)
2014-09-21 14:35:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's an invertible matrix
2014-09-21 14:35:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.math.nyu.edu/~neylon/linalgfall04/project1/jja/group7.htm
2014-09-21 14:35:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the inverse is on that page
2014-09-21 14:35:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your code is working
2014-09-21 14:35:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the first time it calculates the ivnerse
2014-09-21 14:36:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the second time it returns the cached result

2014-09-21 14:40:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, nevermind I see that you did

2014-09-21 16:02:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice. Oh the memories.
2014-09-21 16:12:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like I forgot to give you your black panties back
2014-09-21 16:43:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're quite a pair
2014-09-21 16:44:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the perfect pair!
2014-09-21 17:05:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you 
2014-09-21 17:06:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you too  😘   
2014-09-21 17:06:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this would be a lot easier if I didn't love you so much
2014-09-21 17:10:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was thinking the same thing 
2014-09-21 17:10:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How the only reason this has worked so far is because we love each other so much 
2014-09-21 17:10:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that's also why it really sucks
2014-09-21 17:13:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'm glad we went for it. It still blows my mind you were willing to try!
2014-09-21 17:14:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah yeah, what with my promiscuous history and what not 
2014-09-21 17:15:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]noooo
2014-09-21 17:16:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just seems like a big leap of faith in a way
2014-09-21 17:16:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did it too, but I guess it's less surprising for me
2014-09-21 17:17:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Less surprising...because of your less promiscuous history?
2014-09-21 17:17:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just kidding
2014-09-21 17:18:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm glad we both went for it too obvs
2014-09-21 17:18:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's good. I'm glad I've only been a slight letdown.

2014-09-21 19:26:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or any of those late shows
2014-09-21 19:26:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they go so late!

2014-09-21 19:28:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]live shit is too early
2014-09-21 19:28:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]recorded shit is too late
2014-09-21 19:31:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made salmon stew
2014-09-21 19:31:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's prettttyyyy dope
2014-09-21 19:32:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I feel like you're always eating fish when you're not around me
2014-09-21 19:32:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]am I holding you back?
2014-09-21 19:33:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't mind only eating it when I'm alone
2014-09-21 19:34:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also I buy frozen fish by the bag
2014-09-21 19:34:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-09-21 19:35:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://time.com/3144566/heres-what-a-100-year-old-sex-therapist-thinks-is-wrong-with-sex-today/
2014-09-21 19:35:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When we live together though, you should try something I make
2014-09-21 19:35:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I definitely will!
2014-09-21 19:35:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll try anything you want me to try    😃 
2014-09-21 19:36:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dar posted that link, it's not particularly insightful, but this bit made me think of you "“The use of time is very different in our society today. People are busy all the time. That was not true when I was growing up. At this stage of our development, we want to cover everything, we want to know everything, we want to do everything, and there’s also [our personal] economy which requires an immense amount of time and effort…There is a limit to how much energy and desire and time you can give to one person when there is all this pressure make more money, to be the CEO, to buy a summer house, people want more and more and more. Desire requires a certain amount of energy."
2014-09-21 19:41:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In what way?
2014-09-21 19:42:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess in that you prioritize our relationship.
2014-09-21 19:43:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So it made me think of you in that I didn't think you were like that.
2014-09-21 19:43:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Even if sacrifices have to be made at times in our relationship, I feel like it'll always be a priority for you.
2014-09-21 19:43:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that makes me feel pretty lucky!
2014-09-21 19:45:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-09-21 19:47:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You certainly aren't like that either 
2014-09-21 20:27:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Movie review: very meh
2014-09-21 20:39:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, did you like the first one?
2014-09-21 20:39:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did!
2014-09-21 20:40:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting, it got pretty good reviews
2014-09-21 20:40:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I set my expectations a little too high because of it
2014-09-21 20:40:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This one had weird pacing, and I didn't really like the ending 
2014-09-21 20:41:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it had a weird homosexual reference that I could tell if it was supposed to be a joke or not
2014-09-21 20:41:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what was it?
2014-09-21 20:41:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*couldnt 
2014-09-21 20:41:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The ending?
2014-09-21 20:41:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no the homosexual reference
2014-09-21 20:43:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This adult side kick character said "That's one reason I never got married" referring to some tension between a married couple. 
2014-09-21 20:43:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then followed it up with "well, and for one other reason"
2014-09-21 20:43:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With an awkward pause after
2014-09-21 20:44:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then afterwards he was noticeably flamboyant at parts
2014-09-21 20:44:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see. You think that was inappropriate?
2014-09-21 20:45:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, I guess it just wasn't really funny
2014-09-21 20:45:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's placement in the movie confused me
2014-09-21 20:46:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like, are they making fun of gay people? Or trying to be inclusive?
2014-09-21 20:46:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. I didn't read this article because I want to watch the movie  http://insidemovies.ew.com/2014/06/15/how-to-train-your-dragon-2-gobber-gay/
2014-09-21 20:48:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should watch it
2014-09-21 20:48:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's entertaining 
2014-09-21 20:49:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I guess they meant that comment as a harmless aside, so that's good
2014-09-21 20:50:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool. Yeah, I think I'll try to watch it.
2014-09-21 20:51:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The Wolf of Wall Street is also high on my priority list right now
2014-09-21 20:51:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to watch that with youuu
2014-09-21 20:51:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ooookkkk
2014-09-21 20:54:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-09-21 20:54:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sleepy already
2014-09-21 20:54:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you get any naps in?
2014-09-21 20:55:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not really 
2014-09-21 20:55:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe like 30 min on the plane
2014-09-21 20:56:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm impressed! Have you been drinking caffeine during the day or something?
2014-09-21 20:56:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I took a pill this morning 
2014-09-21 20:56:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-09-21 20:56:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But also I made sure to stay off my bed lol

2014-09-21 21:04:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-09-21 21:05:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]" Both films are speedier than the average animated blockbuster. In places, Dragon 2 is almost too fast to keep up with, and, in other places, it’s a little too dark, at least in 3-D. "
2014-09-21 21:07:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Visually?
2014-09-21 21:07:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess
2014-09-21 21:07:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was mostly sending it for the "too fast to keep up with"
2014-09-21 21:08:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which seemed relevant to your criticism
2014-09-21 21:08:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's from the NY Times by the way
2014-09-21 21:20:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well don't spoil the movie for yourself 
2014-09-21 21:20:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't read it. It was the blurb on Metacritic
2014-09-21 21:40:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Panthers aren't looking too great.
2014-09-21 21:41:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cowboys ended up winning, though.
2014-09-21 21:41:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]🏈🏈🏈
2014-09-21 21:41:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Their biggest regular season comeback ever I guess
2014-09-21 21:41:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-21 21:41:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]such a goofball

2014-09-21 21:45:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna finish silver linings
2014-09-21 21:46:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool.
2014-09-21 21:46:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you know where you stopped?
2014-09-21 21:46:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-09-21 21:47:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i have like an hour left
2014-09-21 21:47:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word!
2014-09-21 22:34:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Such a good movie 
2014-09-21 22:35:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]definitely made me tear up
2014-09-21 22:40:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw I had a feeling you'd like it
2014-09-21 22:40:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i was so nervous it wouldnt be a happy ending!
2014-09-21 22:41:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-21 22:41:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was typing that when you sent that
2014-09-21 22:42:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I said to my mom or someone (or maybe just thought it to myself) that I appreciated the fact that it had a happy ending
2014-09-21 22:42:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like all these Oscars movies always have some strings attached if the ending isn't already completely miserable
2014-09-21 22:43:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]agreed
2014-09-21 22:43:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]this was refreshing
2014-09-21 22:43:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you hugging your mom was the first time I'd ever seen you "tear up"
2014-09-21 22:44:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you've seen me cry
2014-09-21 22:44:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but yeah, not the same I guess
2014-09-21 22:45:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but have I?
2014-09-21 22:45:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that night when we were talking about whether telekinesis could exist and even if it did, would we pick up on it
2014-09-21 22:45:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, but I don't know if I actually saw you crying
2014-09-21 22:46:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or just throw it our as statistical anomalies
2014-09-21 22:46:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was really dark
2014-09-21 22:46:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I've teared up once a little bit after some really sweet love making
2014-09-21 22:46:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]might I don't think I let you know
2014-09-21 22:47:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]might I don't think I let you know   
2014-09-21 22:47:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what
2014-09-21 22:47:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I teared up during Her
2014-09-21 22:47:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]quite a bit actually
2014-09-21 22:47:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]**but I don't think I let you know
2014-09-21 22:48:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-09-21 22:48:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I could tell you had been feeling some emotions during Her
2014-09-21 22:49:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what time was it that you teared up after having sex/
2014-09-21 22:50:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometime during a raleigh visit
2014-09-21 22:50:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would you ever describe me behind you as "making love"
2014-09-21 22:51:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes it can be pretty sweet
2014-09-21 22:51:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]kissing and nuzzling and slow
2014-09-21 22:52:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's true
2014-09-21 22:52:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]even hard and fast sex can make me feel all ooey gooey inside
2014-09-21 22:52:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah?
2014-09-21 22:52:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like during?
2014-09-21 22:52:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or after?
2014-09-21 22:53:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well obviously after
2014-09-21 22:53:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not obvious to me
2014-09-21 22:53:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not inside your head
2014-09-21 22:54:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha I guess I just meant the after sex cuddles when all the endorphins are running to your brain feel very lovey even if we just had hair pulling rough-and-dirty sex
2014-09-21 22:55:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh
2014-09-21 22:55:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well yeah I agree
2014-09-21 22:56:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But right after I have an orgasm (no matter what we're doing to reach that) it's like I'm melting into you or something
2014-09-21 22:57:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel very warm and fuzzy, even if you're fucking me from behind
2014-09-21 22:58:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-09-21 22:58:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like that
2014-09-21 22:58:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's just when you're on top of me I can see your face above me through the warm fuzzy haze
2014-09-21 22:58:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so it feels a little more intimate
2014-09-21 23:00:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I definitely like laying down on you after I finish when I'm behind you
2014-09-21 23:00:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it feels pretty loving for me
2014-09-21 23:01:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get to kiss your neck and back and hold your titties
2014-09-21 23:01:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel loving on top too
2014-09-21 23:01:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I feel like I'm just breathing super hard all up in your space
2014-09-21 23:01:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-21 23:01:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]after I finish that is
2014-09-21 23:02:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like being able to kiss you when I'm on top
2014-09-21 23:02:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha nooo I don't mind
2014-09-21 23:02:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]unless there's no AC, you can breathe heavy on me all you want
2014-09-21 23:02:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-09-21 23:04:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]this interstellar movie looks like it could be cool
2014-09-21 23:05:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]agreed
2014-09-21 23:05:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]see it on my November trip?
2014-09-21 23:05:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's what I was gonna say!
2014-09-21 23:06:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-09-21 23:06:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd totally see this in the theaters
2014-09-21 23:06:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we still haven't seen a movie in theaters, right?
2014-09-21 23:07:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]nope
2014-09-21 23:07:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well maybe we'll finally make it happen
2014-09-21 23:08:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if not then maybe over Thanksgiving
2014-09-21 23:08:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when we will be less sex-deprived
2014-09-21 23:08:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we'll only be two weeks deprived for the first November trip
2014-09-21 23:08:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and when we can get momma silliman to pay for it
2014-09-21 23:09:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-09-21 23:11:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Matthew McConaughey is keeping himself busy these days
2014-09-21 23:11:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]he's blowing up
2014-09-21 23:30:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright I'm drifting to sleep
2014-09-21 23:30:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight, I love you!
2014-09-21 23:31:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wishing desperately I was in your arms 
2014-09-21 23:32:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too. Sweet dreams. I love you.
2014-09-22 10:00:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How long did it take you to bike to the museum?
2014-09-22 10:03:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Google says 30 minutes, but I wouldn't be surprised if it took me closer to 40.
2014-09-22 10:03:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't actually remember, though.
2014-09-22 10:03:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely at least 30.
2014-09-22 10:04:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, google does weird stuff with the actual location of the museum 
2014-09-22 10:04:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where did you lock your bike?
2014-09-22 10:04:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There's a bike rack on the east side of the building. By the entrance closest to Fishes.
2014-09-22 10:05:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-09-22 10:05:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's your morning my dear?
2014-09-22 10:06:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not bad. My phone died overnight so my alarm didn't go off, but I woke up right at 9 anyway.
2014-09-22 10:06:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how's your morning?
2014-09-22 10:06:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you get some rest?
2014-09-22 10:07:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I couldn't fall asleep until like 12:30
2014-09-22 10:07:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And had a lot of really vivid dreams that kept waking me up
2014-09-22 10:07:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I feel mostly rested today
2014-09-22 10:08:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you dream so much!
2014-09-22 10:08:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I guess
2014-09-22 10:08:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've always had pretty vivid dreams
2014-09-22 10:09:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they just wake you up because they feel real?
2014-09-22 10:09:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not necessarily 
2014-09-22 10:10:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]These woke me up because they were stressful 
2014-09-22 10:10:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man. What was happening?
2014-09-22 10:54:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My family was getting ready to go to my old tae Kwon do instructors wedding, and my mom and dad were fighting. My mom really didn't want to go and was being really bitchy about it and making me feel bad for wanting to go. And we were picking out a wedding present in a converse store
2014-09-22 10:55:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was more stressful than it sounds 
2014-09-22 10:55:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it doesn't sound pleasant
2014-09-22 10:56:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kinda want to extract some DNA from myself and sequence it 
2014-09-22 10:57:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha how much would that cost?
2014-09-22 10:57:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I would stick it in with the rest of my samples on a sequencing run
2014-09-22 10:57:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So about $13
2014-09-22 10:58:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word. That'd be pretty cool!
2014-09-22 10:59:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well actually I guess it would cost $80
2014-09-22 10:59:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because i couldn't pool it with the other samples
2014-09-22 11:00:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But $67 of that I pay no matter what
2014-09-22 11:00:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's your call.
2014-09-22 11:00:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But whateve
2014-09-22 11:01:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah I'm not gonna do it
2014-09-22 11:01:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If anyone else asked to look at the raw sequencing reads id be fucked
2014-09-22 11:02:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha probably a good idea not too then
2014-09-22 11:02:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you bike to the museum?
2014-09-22 11:02:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I had to go to campus to get all my shit
2014-09-22 11:02:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna drive 
2014-09-22 11:03:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just asking out of curiosity 
2014-09-22 11:03:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-09-22 11:03:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll probably bike on Thursday 
2014-09-22 11:04:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because I'm going on an architecture boat ride that afternoon with 1st years and they're leaving from the field 
2014-09-22 11:04:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so why is a biking better in that case?
2014-09-22 11:05:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't wanna drive and leave my car there 
2014-09-22 11:05:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, but you're gonna leave your bike?
2014-09-22 11:06:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm I guess maybe that's a bad idea 
2014-09-22 17:11:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]First day at museum was overall a success!
2014-09-22 17:37:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hooray! What'd you do?
2014-09-22 17:59:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Reran the gel (it looked good!) and set up tissue digestions for extraction tm
2014-09-22 17:59:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweeeet
2014-09-22 18:03:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can load coupons on my Tom Thumb and Kroger cards.
2014-09-22 19:37:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty swanky 
2014-09-22 22:57:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's up babe?
2014-09-22 23:03:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not much
2014-09-22 23:04:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's up with you?
2014-09-22 23:07:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We had this beer tasting event tonight 
2014-09-22 23:07:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now hanging at Simons 
2014-09-22 23:09:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's cool. Hanging out with first years?
2014-09-22 23:13:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah
2014-09-22 23:13:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haley, Dallas, Hillary, Simon 
2014-09-22 23:13:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unfortunately anti social 
2014-09-22 23:13:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean
2014-09-22 23:14:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean we're not hanging with 1st years 
2014-09-22 23:14:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah ok
2014-09-22 23:15:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the beer tasting was an orientation thing?
2014-09-22 23:15:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we can just talk tomorrow sometime or whenever you're free next
2014-09-22 23:15:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know you'll be busy this week I suppose
2014-09-22 23:16:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will you be awake in 20 min?
2014-09-22 23:16:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably
2014-09-22 23:38:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm home
2014-09-22 23:38:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But my internet is being super slow
2014-09-22 23:38:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, honestly we shouldn't have internet 
2014-09-22 23:38:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because Darcy hadn't set it up 
2014-09-22 23:40:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha it's all good. I think we should cut back on the late night video sessions anyway.
2014-09-22 23:40:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😭😭😭
2014-09-22 23:40:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not even that late
2014-09-22 23:42:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's kinda late and it would probably go late.
2014-09-22 23:44:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-09-22 23:44:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess
2014-09-22 23:44:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well goodnight
2014-09-22 23:44:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-09-22 23:51:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Goodnight. I love you too.
2014-09-22 23:51:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Snapppp
2014-09-23 09:18:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We have internet!

2014-09-23 09:22:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not bad. How about you?
2014-09-23 09:45:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just talked to Mary West-Eberhard on the phone
2014-09-23 09:45:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know who that is.
2014-09-23 09:47:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Relatively famous scientist, worked on developmental plasticity and behavior in social insects
2014-09-23 09:48:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK.
2014-09-23 09:48:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why were you on the phone with her?
2014-09-23 09:49:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She was nominated as our Sewall wright speaker
2014-09-23 09:49:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice.
2014-09-23 09:59:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But she can't come :/
2014-09-23 10:02:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, that's too bad.
2014-09-23 10:09:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've got the orientation dinner at the Peggy notes art museum tn
2014-09-23 10:11:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But maybe we can talk after?
2014-09-23 10:13:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's cool. I don't think I've been there.
2014-09-23 10:14:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You don't think you're gonna be out late?
2014-09-23 10:16:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's over at 10p
2014-09-23 10:16:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess if that's too late though we can talk some other time
2014-09-23 10:17:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'll just see what time you get back
2014-09-23 10:18:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why the sudden moratorium on late night chats?
2014-09-23 10:20:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just don't think it's something I should be doing on the regular while working in the mornings and taking four classes.
2014-09-23 10:20:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It affects my productivity.
2014-09-23 10:31:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fair enough
2014-09-23 11:06:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you.
2014-09-23 11:07:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:) I love you too
2014-09-23 17:08:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Booty in classssss :))))
2014-09-23 17:38:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought that video from this morning didn't save, but it did! Yay!
2014-09-23 17:38:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It apparently saves the overlay as an image and the video separately.
2014-09-23 22:38:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey honey 
2014-09-23 22:38:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hey, sugar.

2014-09-23 22:43:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got home 
2014-09-23 22:43:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright

2014-09-24 00:23:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol you're the one stewing over my grumpiness
2014-09-24 00:23:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know football is important to you, but I want to be more important than football. 
2014-09-24 00:24:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I don't ask you to make compromises often 
2014-09-24 00:24:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ha you're right. Shouldn't have said anything.
2014-09-24 00:26:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-09-24 00:27:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I loved seeing your face
2014-09-24 00:27:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry I got grumpy 
2014-09-24 00:33:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send me a snapp

2014-09-24 00:33:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Come give me kisssessss
2014-09-24 00:34:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that last one got me to chuckle.
2014-09-24 00:35:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😌  I still got it
2014-09-24 00:39:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're so handsome 
2014-09-24 00:40:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, thanks.
2014-09-24 00:40:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes it feels like physical pain when I see your face, I miss you so much. 
2014-09-24 00:41:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man :( that's sad, but pretty sweet too.
2014-09-24 00:41:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you a lot.
2014-09-24 00:42:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish I could hear about your day face-to-face every day.
2014-09-24 00:42:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]While cuddling
2014-09-24 00:43:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'll happen one day
2014-09-24 00:43:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely. To both.
2014-09-24 00:45:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Goodnight, sugar. I love you so incredibly much.
2014-09-24 00:46:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you too
2014-09-24 09:20:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You aren't my best friend on snapchat anymore :/
2014-09-24 09:20:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like I am again
2014-09-24 09:20:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I had noticed that yesterday
2014-09-24 09:20:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't even top three
2014-09-24 09:20:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah, you're back 
2014-09-24 09:21:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You weren't reciprocating the snaps
2014-09-24 09:21:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess in person sexiness leads to decrease snap sexiness
2014-09-24 09:22:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That makes sense I suppose
2014-09-24 09:22:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but DAMN you are sexy
2014-09-24 09:22:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you are literally a 10
2014-09-24 09:23:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You might be biased my dear lol
2014-09-24 09:23:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But thanks 
2014-09-24 09:28:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I realize I'm biased but you seriously have a great ass (and you can't claim that is biased because I noticed before I loved you), your tits aren't too big or too small and they're really nice to look at (nice shape, nothing weird going on), you're not too skinny and you're not fat, you have nice legs, a sexy back, and a really pretty and interesting face and awesome curly hair (both also noticed before I loved you)
2014-09-24 09:28:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]soo yeah. Not that I would change anything about you physically, but even if I could I wouldn't know what to do.
2014-09-24 09:30:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:) Well you sure know how to put a pep inmy step
2014-09-24 09:31:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha good  😘   
2014-09-24 10:16:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That awkward moment when you're the only one in the elevator so you fart, and then the head administration of the museum get in on the next floor -_-
2014-09-24 10:17:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-24 10:17:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did it smell bad?
2014-09-24 10:24:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-24 10:24:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]niiiice
2014-09-24 11:08:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, I'm pure sex
2014-09-24 11:09:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😉 
2014-09-24 13:21:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's so cold in the lab it makes my nipples hurt 
2014-09-24 13:22:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wow! That sounds unpleasant. They're just super hard?
2014-09-24 13:22:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I guess, I haven't really peaked under my bra to check 
2014-09-24 13:22:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They just ache
2014-09-24 13:23:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man, that sucks. Are you in that lab where museum attendees can see in?
2014-09-24 13:23:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My bench is in a back room, but I do some work up there 
2014-09-24 13:23:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice.
2014-09-24 15:53:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sooo many undergrads on campus
2014-09-24 15:53:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha WTF are they doing there?
2014-09-24 15:54:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They go to school here too? Lol
2014-09-24 15:54:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oooooh    😉 
2014-09-24 15:55:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dork 
2014-09-24 15:55:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just had my advising meeting
2014-09-24 15:55:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how'd it go?
2014-09-24 15:55:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good
2014-09-24 15:55:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. Taking any classes?
2014-09-24 15:56:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The TA training course
2014-09-24 15:56:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-09-24 15:56:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybeee a stats class, but if it's offered winter I'll take it then 
2014-09-24 15:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what stats class?
2014-09-24 15:57:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then I think I might audit the biophycology  of sex differences 
2014-09-24 15:57:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha plant sex
2014-09-24 15:57:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's one that Nancy cox teaches, like stats with application in genetics 
2014-09-24 15:58:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-09-24 16:00:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the first Bioinformatics stuff on Coursera is up
2014-09-24 16:00:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like it's gonna be a lot better than the one I'm in (surprise!)
2014-09-24 16:10:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-09-24 16:10:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I'm looking forward to it
2014-09-24 16:11:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll probably start looking at the stuff next week
2014-09-24 16:25:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All my extractions from this week looked really good!
2014-09-24 16:25:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you da woman
2014-09-24 16:29:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I feel totally justified in not doing anything tonight :)
2014-09-24 16:29:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha there you go
2014-09-24 16:30:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe We can watch a masters of sex episode?
2014-09-24 16:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that'd be fun.
2014-09-24 16:31:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm caught up with you
2014-09-24 16:31:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah you are
2014-09-24 16:32:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to have class 5:30-9p on Tuesdays
2014-09-24 16:32:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, class and then band
2014-09-24 16:32:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh that's not so bad
2014-09-24 16:32:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was about to say eff that
2014-09-24 16:33:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but band should be at least mildly entertaining usually
2014-09-24 16:33:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-24 16:34:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll just have to entertain yourself on those Tuesdays when you visit
2014-09-24 16:34:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll schedule my work for later in the day.
2014-09-24 16:34:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you work during non office hours?
2014-09-24 16:34:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can work whenever I want.
2014-09-24 16:35:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool
2014-09-24 16:35:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you could go to trivia 
2014-09-24 16:35:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With rob and them 
2014-09-24 16:35:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who's all going these days?
2014-09-24 16:37:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't been but from the email group it looks like Laura M, Courtney/Rob, Jon sometimes, Laura S., Sara, and Nate Burkel (the kinda creepy neuro guy) 
2014-09-24 16:39:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. Word, it was like me Rob A., Tim, Rob. L, and Laura M. as the regulars with Jon coming frequently.
2014-09-24 16:40:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol two words in that message
2014-09-24 16:40:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Actually there were ~18
2014-09-24 16:40:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]boooooooo
2014-09-24 16:41:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😑 
2014-09-24 16:41:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In so funnyyyy
2014-09-24 16:44:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found out yesterday that Tim, Brian, and Sara are flying to Australia in dec to travel with Christina and AJ
2014-09-24 16:45:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jon was supposed to go too but backed out, so now Sara is like an awkward 5th wheel with 2 couples that haven't seen each other in months
2014-09-24 16:46:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]eh it's not that awkward
2014-09-24 16:46:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she lived with A.J. for a while
2014-09-24 16:46:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're only booking 2 rooms everywhere, since Sara can't afford to pay for a room by herself 
2014-09-24 16:46:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And so they trade off in who's room she'll stay in
2014-09-24 16:47:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-24 16:47:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's kinda awkward
2014-09-24 16:47:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's kinda awkard
2014-09-24 16:48:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need a back massage
2014-09-24 16:48:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]realllllly would like to give you one
2014-09-24 16:48:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]naked
2014-09-24 16:48:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](in case that needed to be stated)
2014-09-24 16:49:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well then why not just go with a full body massage
2014-09-24 16:49:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would obviously become that
2014-09-24 17:19:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]didn't we stand the hotel for three nights?
2014-09-24 17:19:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-09-24 17:20:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I was only charged for two
2014-09-24 17:20:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you booked Saturday night, did you pay anything?
2014-09-24 17:20:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my AmEx has charges for Sep 17th and Sep 18th
2014-09-24 17:21:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and there are no pending charges
2014-09-24 17:21:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do those total to?
2014-09-24 17:21:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]around $100
2014-09-24 17:21:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-09-24 17:26:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Looks like I'll take a stats course this quarter after all 
2014-09-24 17:26:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One that has a final and weekly homework  😟🔫
2014-09-24 17:27:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]boooooo
2014-09-24 17:28:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that class sounds pretty useful, though
2014-09-24 17:28:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt you'll need much more stats after it
2014-09-24 17:30:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you going to take both quarters?
2014-09-24 17:39:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno
2014-09-24 17:40:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If the work load isn't terrible, i probably will
2014-09-24 17:40:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Turns out it's full though
2014-09-24 17:40:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I may not even get in after all 
2014-09-24 17:40:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can definitely teach yourself stats through online courses
2014-09-24 17:41:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I know
2014-09-24 17:42:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This would probably be a rigorous way to make sure I get it in though
2014-09-24 17:42:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would be more accountable I guess
2014-09-24 17:43:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I don't really mind math classes
2014-09-24 17:43:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless they're taught poorly
2014-09-24 17:43:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I actually really enjoyed differential equations 
2014-09-24 17:44:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I never took that class
2014-09-24 17:44:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I never took a linear algebra class either
2014-09-24 17:44:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my formal mathematical training is actually pretty lacking for someone on my track
2014-09-24 17:45:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you taken them online?
2014-09-24 17:45:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-24 17:46:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like linear algebra could be really useful 
2014-09-24 17:46:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-09-24 17:46:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know how to multiply matrices
2014-09-24 17:46:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I really need the rest
2014-09-24 17:48:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like state-space modeling?
2014-09-24 17:49:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know what that is
2014-09-24 17:50:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a way to model a system with various inputs and outputs
2014-09-24 17:53:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess if it hasn't been an issue yet you probably don't need it
2014-09-24 17:54:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know who needs it
2014-09-24 17:58:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you took differential equations in graduate school?
2014-09-24 17:59:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No in undergrad
2014-09-24 17:59:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got a math minor
2014-09-24 17:59:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-09-24 17:59:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just for the hell of it?
2014-09-24 18:03:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My advisor said math would be helpful when pursuing a pgs
2014-09-24 18:03:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*phd
2014-09-24 18:03:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it did come in use for community and population ecology I guess
2014-09-24 18:03:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Certainly for PopGen
2014-09-24 18:04:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how many hours did you take as an undergad?
2014-09-24 18:05:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like 156 not including 40 AP credits
2014-09-24 18:05:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's like two extra semesters
2014-09-24 18:05:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you had 40 AP credits?
2014-09-24 18:05:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WTF?
2014-09-24 18:05:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what was your GPA?
2014-09-24 18:10:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't remember, like 3.75
2014-09-24 18:10:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They gave 10 credits for a 5 on the bio ap
2014-09-24 18:11:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, that's kinda ridiculous
2014-09-24 18:11:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-24 18:15:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's crazy how different of quality high schools are
2014-09-24 18:15:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Texas definitely seems like it was more on top of AP stuff then Ohio
2014-09-24 18:15:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we had 3 AP courses
2014-09-24 18:15:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Calculus, History, and English
2014-09-24 18:15:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and like
2014-09-24 18:16:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty obvious now how uncompetitive that would make a student
2014-09-24 18:16:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when applying for scholarships and shit
2014-09-24 18:17:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-09-24 18:17:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]scholarships are all so bull shit
2014-09-24 18:18:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my brother got a full ride to Auburn cuz he got a 35 on his ACt
2014-09-24 18:18:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I only got in state
2014-09-24 18:18:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and maybe a couple extra thousand
2014-09-24 18:18:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I only got a 32
2014-09-24 18:18:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I had a much better GPA than him
2014-09-24 18:18:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and started a fucking charity club
2014-09-24 18:18:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and volunteered at a soup kitchen for two years
2014-09-24 18:20:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I know how to game the system for my kids now at least
2014-09-24 18:22:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll state schools obviously have to go more by the numbers
2014-09-24 18:22:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They get so many applications
2014-09-24 18:22:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The reason I got a full scholarship though was because I had research experience
2014-09-24 18:23:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]exactly that's what I mean
2014-09-24 18:23:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you need to pander to academics
2014-09-24 18:23:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so send the kid to some university run camps or something
2014-09-24 18:23:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]get them some "academic" projects before college
2014-09-24 18:23:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even if they don't want to go to academia
2014-09-24 18:24:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or be good at sports 
2014-09-24 18:24:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or get a really high test score 
2014-09-24 18:24:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or apply to a school specific to your talent that involves an audition
2014-09-24 18:24:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]only the first one has real power, though
2014-09-24 18:25:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or the ability to be influenced
2014-09-24 18:31:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your experience makes me even more bitter about my undergrad
2014-09-24 18:33:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jeez I'll just stop talking about my life then
2014-09-24 19:54:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to Haley's for a bit, if it's not too late when I get back I'll let you know
2014-09-24 23:09:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey
2014-09-24 23:09:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]howdy
2014-09-24 23:10:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to?
2014-09-24 23:10:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]working on some homework a bit
2014-09-24 23:10:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what about you?
2014-09-24 23:10:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Darcy and I just got back from Haley's 
2014-09-24 23:11:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was it?
2014-09-24 23:11:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We went in on a pot delivery
2014-09-24 23:11:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-09-24 23:13:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah we got a pretty good price and got to meet her dealer so we could order straight from him
2014-09-24 23:13:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He's a uchicago student and very particular about who picks up from him and in not really knowing his name 
2014-09-24 23:25:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmk well I'm probably going to bed soon, goodnight!
2014-09-24 23:26:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight
2014-09-24 23:27:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-09-24 23:27:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too
2014-09-25 08:25:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's one of those mornings where I hit snooze for over an hour
2014-09-25 08:28:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That really sounds terrible to me haha
2014-09-25 08:34:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll have to help kick me out of bed when we sleep together 
2014-09-25 09:49:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In order to install the new iOS update I has to free up 4.6 gigs of space!
2014-09-25 09:50:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]holy moley
2014-09-25 09:50:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a lot
2014-09-25 09:50:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on your phone or tablet?
2014-09-25 09:50:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Phone. So basically deleting every non-apple app (because they don't let you delete those) and half my pics, all my songs, and old text message threads
2014-09-25 09:50:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The update itself is almost 1 gb
2014-09-25 09:51:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you back everything up?
2014-09-25 09:51:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah some of the pictures had already been backed up elsewhere, and I have all my songs on my computer
2014-09-25 09:51:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But reinstalling apps will be a pain 
2014-09-25 09:52:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can't you back that up too, though?
2014-09-25 09:52:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like Apple's back up
2014-09-25 09:52:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But restoring from backup would've taken just as long as reinstalling from the store 
2014-09-25 09:53:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you lose all your data
2014-09-25 09:53:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, everything I deleted is linked to an online account of some sort. Like Dropbox or Evernote or Facebook
2014-09-25 09:54:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just meant app data, so you'll have to re set everything up
2014-09-25 09:55:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and games will lose all their data
2014-09-25 09:55:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I saved the games 
2014-09-25 09:55:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-09-25 09:55:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I guess you're set then
2014-09-25 09:57:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I'm going to be getting a new phone for a while    😞 
2014-09-25 09:57:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They still haven't said anything about a new one?
2014-09-25 09:58:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no, but I don't think I'd be getting it anyway
2014-09-25 09:58:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why not?
2014-09-25 09:58:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's about to be a pretty significant bump in CPU architecture
2014-09-25 09:59:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At some point having a working phone is more important than having the best phone
2014-09-25 10:01:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not a minor upgrade, though
2014-09-25 10:02:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.anandtech.com/show/7925/qualcomms-snapdragon-808810-20nm-highend-64bit-socs-with-lte-category-67-support-in-2015
2014-09-25 11:07:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I just meant if your phone likes stops working almost completely 
2014-09-25 11:08:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'll manage. The 810 is powerful enough that my next phone would last me until it breaks or until I just feel like getting a new one.
2014-09-25 11:08:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It won't ever feel slow.
2014-09-25 11:09:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if you're current phone breaks before the 810 gets here
2014-09-25 11:09:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got paid!
2014-09-25 11:09:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cha-ching!
2014-09-25 11:12:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it went up $1000 this year 
2014-09-25 11:12:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when you gonna put a ring on it girrllllll
2014-09-25 11:12:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for the whole year?
2014-09-25 11:12:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or per quarter?
2014-09-25 11:13:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Year 
2014-09-25 11:13:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-09-25 11:13:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it went up while I was there
2014-09-25 11:13:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]of course
2014-09-25 11:13:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what is the full stipend now?
2014-09-25 11:13:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got on a training grant 
2014-09-25 11:13:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-09-25 11:13:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]$30k

2014-09-25 15:06:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Got a free Chick-fil-A sandwich and the student union has discounted drinks from 2-4, so I got a Chick-fil-A meal for $1.7.9
2014-09-25 15:38:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whatttt 
2014-09-25 15:38:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm jealous 
2014-09-25 15:50:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should go kayaking on the river next summer
2014-09-25 16:04:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. We should go kayaking somewhere a little less human-influenced too.
2014-09-25 16:13:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I knowww, but it looks like fun!
2014-09-25 16:13:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm down yo!

2014-09-25 16:24:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not good.
2014-09-25 16:24:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we can text now if you want.
2014-09-25 16:25:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because it's all the same app for me.
2014-09-25 16:25:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just won't be able to see when you've read stuff.
2014-09-25 16:25:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe reboot the phone, though.
2014-09-25 16:25:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yeah it's from 3:30-4:30
2014-09-25 16:26:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah mwah mwah 
2014-09-25 18:16:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh I am so bad at the tuba right now

2014-09-25 18:54:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mostly meant that I'm a lot worse than I use to be as far as tone quality 
2014-09-25 18:54:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but still better than most people?
2014-09-25 18:55:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Looks like I might be going out tonight with priya and friend of ours from miami 
2014-09-25 18:55:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice.

2014-09-25 19:08:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I rebooted and everything 
2014-09-25 19:08:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It doesn't even have a little red thing on the app

2014-09-25 19:20:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't know there were bars around their
2014-09-25 19:21:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've already done all those steps they listed

2014-09-25 19:42:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nope

2014-09-25 19:42:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you doing tonight?
2014-09-25 19:42:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well, if it's any consolation, I wouldn't have known if you didn't tell me    😉 
2014-09-25 19:42:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just homework and Thursday night football
2014-09-25 19:46:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]wouldn't't have known what?
2014-09-25 19:46:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that your notifications weren't working
2014-09-25 19:47:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh, because I'm always so poor at responding to messages in a timely manner?
2014-09-25 19:47:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-09-25 19:48:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well that's good
2014-09-25 19:51:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was the architecture tour?
2014-09-25 19:52:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]good
2014-09-25 19:52:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]really pretty day
2014-09-25 20:21:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why would the min function in R be giving me the wrong minimum?
2014-09-25 20:21:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you send me the line of code
2014-09-25 20:22:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hos <- subset(data, State==state)            stuff <- hos[,outCol]                   minn <- min(stuff, na.rm = TRUE)
2014-09-25 20:23:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not giving you the smallest number?
2014-09-25 20:23:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what does stuff hold?
2014-09-25 20:32:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no it's not
2014-09-25 20:32:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]stuff holds a vector of a particular column in the data set
2014-09-25 20:33:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ohhhh
2014-09-25 20:33:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]stuff is giving me a character vector of the numbers
2014-09-25 20:33:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, that was my guess.
2014-09-25 20:34:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sweet
2014-09-25 21:21:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm heading out

2014-09-26 08:41:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘

2014-09-26 08:54:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we ended up going out in River north 
2014-09-26 08:55:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So farther away for me to come home from 
2014-09-26 08:55:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, alright.
2014-09-26 08:56:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Where are you going now?
2014-09-26 08:57:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]South Shore Cultural center for the all day Darwin retreat
2014-09-26 08:59:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice well have fun. I hope you feel better.

2014-09-26 09:09:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]work/class/homework
2014-09-26 09:12:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool cool
2014-09-26 09:13:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What were you planning on doing next week
2014-09-26 09:13:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha the same thing? This is my life.
2014-09-26 09:14:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I thought you were planning to go to a show or something 
2014-09-26 09:15:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope
2014-09-26 09:16:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you just go to some bars last night?
2014-09-26 09:16:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, and this one that was a little bit more underground club-esque
2014-09-26 09:17:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where we made "friends" with dudes at a vip table 
2014-09-26 09:17:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And they gave us free drinks 
2014-09-26 09:18:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then every time we went to the bathroom the bouncer escorted us and that was a little too weird 
2014-09-26 09:22:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice.
2014-09-26 09:23:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why did the bouncer escort you?
2014-09-26 09:23:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cuz you were at the VIP table?
2014-09-26 09:24:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess
2014-09-26 09:24:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like the dude with the table asked him too
2014-09-26 09:25:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-09-26 09:25:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's pretty convenient
2014-09-26 09:25:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what did the guys do/
2014-09-26 09:25:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-09-26 09:29:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is it really a feminist thing to do to exploit the guys buying free drinks social trope?
2014-09-26 09:31:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess trope isn't the right word
2014-09-26 09:31:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you know what I'm saying
2014-09-26 09:36:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No, it's not.
2014-09-26 09:37:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did y'all dance?
2014-09-26 09:37:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did they have any coke?
2014-09-26 09:48:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They invited us to their table 
2014-09-26 09:49:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]k
2014-09-26 09:51:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No what's not?
2014-09-26 10:44:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What did you mean?
2014-09-26 10:46:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was saying I didn't think it was a feminist thing to do. It was antagonistic.
2014-09-26 11:51:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I guess that's the end of that conversation then
2014-09-26 11:55:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-26 12:20:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't know how to deal with your negativity sometimes 
2014-09-26 12:27:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-09-26 12:29:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think that was all that negative
2014-09-26 12:29:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but whatever
2014-09-26 12:29:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've been over this conversation since about 9:00 AM
2014-09-26 12:30:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"conversation"
2014-09-26 12:30:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not just your comment, it's your tone
2014-09-26 12:31:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Including the texts you just sent 
2014-09-26 12:32:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]obviously those were negative
2014-09-26 12:32:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you just said you don't know how to deal with my negativity
2014-09-26 12:35:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you're going to act like this every time I'm busy or go out and have fun or talk about my undergrad experience it's going to wear me down 
2014-09-27 00:53:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey 
2014-09-27 00:54:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Howdy
2014-09-27 00:55:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's up?
2014-09-27 00:55:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not much. You?
2014-09-27 00:56:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got home from a jazz thing at the Promontory 
2014-09-27 00:57:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's cool. How was it?
2014-09-27 00:57:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] It was a lot of fun
2014-09-27 00:58:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]$10 entry which was kinda lame, but the music was good and I got a lot of dancing in
2014-09-27 00:59:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's good.
2014-09-27 01:00:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, I'm sure you wanna crash soon. Goodnight! 
2014-09-27 01:03:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Goodnight
2014-09-27 01:07:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you going to sleep or something?
2014-09-27 01:08:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess eventually 
2014-09-27 01:08:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just know you don't wanna talk later
2014-09-27 01:08:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*late
2014-09-27 01:08:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK.
2014-09-27 01:09:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean, I can tell you if I'd like to go to sleep, right?
2014-09-27 01:09:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes?
2014-09-27 01:10:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So are we done talking because you're done talking then?
2014-09-27 01:11:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] We can keep taking if you want to
2014-09-27 01:14:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How was your day?
2014-09-27 01:14:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not bad
2014-09-27 01:15:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very long, but I played whiffleball for the first time 
2014-09-27 01:15:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And got lots of free food
2014-09-27 01:15:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's cool.
2014-09-27 01:16:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Who did you okay whiffle ball with?
2014-09-27 01:17:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My team was a selection of 2-5 years 
2014-09-27 01:18:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anyways, I'm pretty exhausted 
2014-09-27 01:18:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry
2014-09-27 01:18:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight, maybe we'll talk tn
2014-09-27 01:18:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]K
2014-09-27 01:18:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*tm
2014-09-27 01:21:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This shit is so bull shit haha
2014-09-27 01:22:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Let's just take a break when we're apart like you originally suggested.
2014-09-27 01:22:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool
2014-09-27 01:23:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you gonna remove me from all your social media?
2014-09-27 01:23:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-09-27 01:23:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like why did you say "maybe we'll talk tomorrow"
2014-09-27 01:24:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well maybe you won't want to talk tomorrow, or maybe I'll be busy
2014-09-27 01:25:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh I see.
2014-09-27 01:25:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I was being difficult or w/e. I am tired though so I'm gonna crash
2014-09-27 01:25:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gnight
2014-09-27 01:26:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Whatever, man.
2014-09-27 01:26:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you really wanna break up tn I guess we can 
2014-09-27 01:26:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What?
2014-09-27 01:27:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's just take a break when we're apart like you originally suggested."
2014-09-27 02:52:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why'd you hang up?
2014-09-27 02:52:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hangouts crashed.
2014-09-27 02:53:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We should probably go to sleep, though.
2014-09-27 02:54:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:((((((((//////(((((((
2014-09-27 02:54:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awwww
2014-09-27 02:55:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry I was a jerk today.
2014-09-27 02:55:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am ridiculously tired though
2014-09-27 02:55:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So maybe for the best 
2014-09-27 02:55:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like it.
2014-09-27 02:56:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you, my super fun, interesting, and adventurous girlfriend!
2014-09-27 02:56:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know you don't consciously mean to make me feel bad 
2014-09-27 02:57:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I appreciate everything you do for me and how much you care about my well-being
2014-09-27 03:00:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you so much, and I just want to make you happy. I Our life together is a little bit jerky at the moment, but sooner than you think our lives will be tangled in each other forever 
2014-09-27 03:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know :) but I'm gonna enjoy the present with you too.
2014-09-27 03:02:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really do think I'm crazy lucky to have you.
2014-09-27 03:02:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know
2014-09-27 03:02:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We just gotta get better about showing/seeing that 
2014-09-27 03:03:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe just more consistent? I feel like we're really good at it at times.
2014-09-27 03:04:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're so good kids if the timbd
2014-09-27 03:05:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Most of the time?
2014-09-27 03:06:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well sweet dreams, sugar. I love you.
2014-09-27 10:07:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I barely remember our conversation last night.
2014-09-27 10:07:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But based on our last texts I assume we didn't break up? Lol
2014-09-27 10:23:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Were you drunk?
2014-09-27 10:28:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A bit, but I think I was mostly just exhausted
2014-09-27 10:30:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know I cried a lot 
2014-09-27 10:31:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah. I guess I should've realized that.
2014-09-27 10:32:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's pretty interesting
2014-09-27 10:32:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's happened a couple of times now
2014-09-27 10:32:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me crying?
2014-09-27 10:32:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you know we talked on the phone?
2014-09-27 10:32:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you not remembering the conversation
2014-09-27 10:33:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't remember the specific comments over an hour and a half
2014-09-27 10:34:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know you felt bad near the end, and that you said I didn't make time for you this week
2014-09-27 10:35:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I guess you got the gist.
2014-09-27 10:36:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got the gist, the "I guess we didn't break up" comment was mostly a joke
2014-09-27 10:37:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-09-27 10:37:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's probably something I can handle better too, though.
2014-09-27 10:38:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-09-27 10:38:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should've realized you were fucked up and not instigated things.
2014-09-27 10:38:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could've told you more explicitly 
2014-09-27 10:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess
2014-09-27 10:39:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the odds of you not being intoxicatd that late after being at a bar are pretty low
2014-09-27 10:40:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I also got like 5 hr of poor sleep the night before and was out of the house for over 16 hours
2014-09-27 10:48:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What game are you going to watch at 11?
2014-09-27 10:50:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Georgia/Tennessee
2014-09-27 10:52:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess A&M and Arkansas are playing in the Cowboys' stadium
2014-09-27 10:52:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that would've been fun to go to
2014-09-27 10:53:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Weren't you thinking about going to some football game soon?
2014-09-27 10:53:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]TCU?
2014-09-27 10:53:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-27 10:53:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When?
2014-09-27 10:54:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oct 18th maybe
2014-09-27 10:54:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they play Oklahoma State
2014-09-27 10:55:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they play Oklahoma next week, but the tickets are pretty expensive
2014-09-27 10:55:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what I was thinking when I asked what you were doing next weekend
2014-09-27 10:55:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yesterday morning 
2014-09-27 10:56:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should go to one of them, that'd be fun
2014-09-27 10:57:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish I would've known about the game today earlier
2014-09-27 10:57:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I probably will
2014-09-27 10:57:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not very easy to get too, is the only thing
2014-09-27 10:58:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well invite Carl, and say you'll buy his lunch there or something if he drives 
2014-09-27 11:00:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like i can rent a car for about $30 too, if he can't go
2014-09-27 11:02:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-09-27 11:03:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you still want a birthday party when you visit? 
2014-09-27 11:03:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-09-27 11:04:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just thought I'd double check in the morning when things aren't so dramatic 
2014-09-27 11:05:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK, it's your call!
2014-09-27 11:05:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would have fun, but I don't need one.
2014-09-27 11:06:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's do it
2014-09-27 11:06:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't thrown a party in a long time 
2014-09-27 11:07:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hosting people can kind of unnecessarily stress me out, but I think it would be a lot of fun with you there
2014-09-27 11:08:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well don't stress out over it, if it seems like too much it doesn't have to happen
2014-09-27 11:11:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not the planning, it's the during 
2014-09-27 11:11:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like what if people have a terrible time and are bored??
2014-09-27 11:11:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-09-27 11:20:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The tomorrowworld live snapchat thing is pretty sick
2014-09-27 11:21:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah the live thing is an awesome idea
2014-09-27 11:22:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you share your stories to everyone?
2014-09-27 11:23:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My story is shared to everyone 
2014-09-27 11:23:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. I'm guessing those are the only ones they use.
2014-09-27 11:23:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah
2014-09-27 11:24:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But they aren't shared to everyone, just all your friends 
2014-09-27 11:24:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bet they still ask permission
2014-09-27 11:25:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty sure "everyone" means anyone that follows you
2014-09-27 11:25:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I doubt they have to ask
2014-09-27 11:25:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's like Twitter
2014-09-27 11:26:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But they wouldn't co-op your tweet to show to everyone with Twitter if you had a private account 
2014-09-27 11:26:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like depending on your privacy settings people have to request to be your friend 
2014-09-27 11:26:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but by sharing to everyone you're basically making the equivalent of a public tweet
2014-09-27 11:27:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But when I share my story, it's only to my friends 
2014-09-27 11:27:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I was asking you
2014-09-27 11:27:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you said everyone before
2014-09-27 11:27:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then I corrected myself
2014-09-27 11:28:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK so you have the setting set to "everyone" or "my friends"?
2014-09-27 11:29:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-09-27 11:29:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm saying if a person has that set to "everyone"
2014-09-27 11:29:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Snapchat doesn't have to ask to use it
2014-09-27 11:30:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it's public
2014-09-27 11:30:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-09-27 11:30:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder how the hell they curate those
2014-09-27 11:31:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess they have location info
2014-09-27 11:31:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They probably get location info
2014-09-27 11:31:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-09-27 11:31:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still seems like a lot to filter, though?
2014-09-27 11:32:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They probably have a couple people who's job is just to click through pictures and 10 sec videos for a event 
2014-09-27 11:32:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You get get through quite a few in a relatively short period of time 
2014-09-27 11:33:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I suppose.
2014-09-27 11:33:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Seems like there could be a way to use some machine learning to make it easier, but I'm not sure.
2014-09-27 11:33:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like number of seconds something was viewed.
2014-09-27 11:34:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if a bunch of people watched the whole video clip/pic, then it was probably entertaining
2014-09-27 11:34:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah but you would need to have a person double check in case it had inappropriate content 
2014-09-27 11:35:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or like 5 sec pictures can get viewed entirely but weren't that good
2014-09-27 11:35:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right, I'm saying it'd be like a ranking algorithm
2014-09-27 11:35:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's where the machine learning would come in
2014-09-27 11:36:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have length of snap, number of viewers, and number of seconds
2014-09-27 11:36:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you have another parameter that is human assigned "good" or "bad"
2014-09-27 11:36:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and when you look at enough you can start predicting
2014-09-27 11:36:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could even recognize titties
2014-09-27 11:37:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should work for snapchat lol
2014-09-27 11:38:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]SOMEONE wants me to live in Chicago    😉 
2014-09-27 11:59:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe they have a chicago office?
2014-09-27 12:00:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like there in Venice, CA
2014-09-27 12:00:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt they're big enough to need two offices
2014-09-27 12:01:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-09-27 12:02:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I told a bunch of people you're moving to Chicago yesterday haha
2014-09-27 12:02:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at the retreat?
2014-09-27 12:02:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-27 12:03:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw, that's cute
2014-09-27 12:03:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like people would ask about you and school and the distance thing and I would say it'll be over in May
2014-09-27 12:03:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you say about the distance thing?
2014-09-27 12:04:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It sucks but we're getting lots of visits in
2014-09-27 12:04:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]accurate
2014-09-27 12:04:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And at the Jazz thing last night Dallas and I got to hang out a lot, which was nice
2014-09-27 12:04:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And he talked about his long distance in college 
2014-09-27 12:04:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where they took greyhounds all the time
2014-09-27 12:05:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So thank god we don't have to do that
2014-09-27 12:05:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well how far apart were they?
2014-09-27 12:05:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if it was like 5-6 hours I think that'd be better
2014-09-27 12:05:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Shreveport to Lubbock 
2014-09-27 12:06:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh shit
2014-09-27 12:06:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like a 15 hr bus
2014-09-27 12:06:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yuck
2014-09-27 12:06:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, Iuri (my cohort in E&E) lived with his bf for 5 years, They were MARRIED, and now they're doing PhDs in different states
2014-09-27 12:06:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So they'll be doing long distance for 5+ years
2014-09-27 12:07:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how often do they see each other?
2014-09-27 12:08:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like you'd have to either have a low sex drive or an open relationship for that to work
2014-09-27 12:08:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless you were seeing each other every couple weekends
2014-09-27 12:08:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He's in CA
2014-09-27 12:08:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It looks like every 6 weeks or so
2014-09-27 12:09:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah eff that
2014-09-27 12:14:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you and Dallas are good then?
2014-09-27 12:15:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]eh, he's still a gossip 
2014-09-27 12:16:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and that group is still cliqueish
2014-09-27 12:16:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but its all good
2014-09-27 12:16:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think the new kids are gonna be alright?
2014-09-27 12:18:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah, I like them all except for an E&E girl who talks too much
2014-09-27 12:18:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but that might chill out once shes more comfortable I guess
2014-09-27 12:19:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think they're all going to get along well too
2014-09-27 12:19:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]there's a guy coming in to do biomechanics with mark
2014-09-27 12:19:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]who looks like he's 18
2014-09-27 12:19:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well I guess he's only 22 anyways
2014-09-27 12:19:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-09-27 12:20:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's his name?
2014-09-27 12:24:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]uhhh  I can't remember
2014-09-27 12:24:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]andrew?
2014-09-27 12:24:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]he's got red hair 
2014-09-27 12:24:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm bad with names
2014-09-27 12:29:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]dude thanks again for the watchespn thing
2014-09-27 12:29:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no problem
2014-09-27 12:29:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty sweet
2014-09-27 12:53:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I missssss youuuuu
2014-09-27 12:56:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you too darling
2014-09-27 12:57:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want couch cuddles while watching football
2014-09-27 12:57:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds perfect
2014-09-27 14:34:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you ever been to the Midtown Drinkery
2014-09-27 14:34:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In Chicago?
2014-09-27 14:34:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Houston
2014-09-27 14:35:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's where the Houston Auburn club meets for games
2014-09-27 14:35:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking we could check it out for the Iron Bowl maybe
2014-09-27 14:36:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they seem pretty active/fun
2014-09-27 14:37:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks younger than the Dallas one too
2014-09-27 14:40:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no i don't think I've been out in that area
2014-09-27 14:40:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that'd be really fun though!
2014-09-27 14:41:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd have hit three different TX Auburn Clubs if we do that
2014-09-27 14:41:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]DFW, Austin, and Houston
2014-09-27 14:41:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just missing San Antonio I guess?
2014-09-27 14:41:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I'll start a little Auburn club collection
2014-09-27 14:41:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]thats not a bad goal
2014-09-27 14:42:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and try to go to ones in different cities if I'm there for football games
2014-09-27 14:42:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]did you go to one in raleigh?
2014-09-27 14:42:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it wasn't football season
2014-09-27 14:42:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh yeah, duh
2014-09-27 14:42:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did actually try to look up some info on their club, though, and I couldn't really find anything
2014-09-27 14:57:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]its a smaller city
2014-09-27 14:57:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]programming is so satisfying
2014-09-27 14:58:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]when it works
2014-09-27 14:58:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha dude I know!
2014-09-27 14:58:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did like almost all of the coding assignments for the first chapter of the Bioinformatics course yesterday
2014-09-27 14:58:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll be curious to see how much you're able to do of those
2014-09-27 14:59:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it was hard?
2014-09-27 14:59:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a couple of them were a little involved
2014-09-27 14:59:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]two are like legitimate computer science problems
2014-09-27 15:00:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had to actually look up one
2014-09-27 15:00:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's one I haven't done yet
2014-09-27 15:00:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was on the right track with how I was thinking about it
2014-09-27 15:01:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but implementing it is actually pretty tricky and requires some pretty deep knowledge about whatever language you're using
2014-09-27 15:01:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in my case Python
2014-09-27 15:02:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hmm
2014-09-27 15:02:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if the programming assignments are actually gonna be required or not, though
2014-09-27 15:02:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there were a lot
2014-09-27 15:02:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe I will start on them early
2014-09-27 15:02:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've been playing around on Rosalind
2014-09-27 15:02:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so my python is probably better than my R right now
2014-09-27 15:03:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Python is where it's at
2014-09-27 15:03:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://stepic.org/lesson/Some-Hidden-Messages-are-More-Elusive-than-Others-9/step/7?course=Bioinformatics-Algorithms&unit=407
2014-09-27 15:03:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is the hard one I had to look up
2014-09-27 15:04:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's a very "algorithms" question
2014-09-27 15:04:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in that you have to find a trick to make it efficient
2014-09-27 15:05:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I see
2014-09-27 15:23:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So during your visits, I'll probably have to work at the museum 3:30-5:30p on Sundays and Monday mornings
2014-09-27 15:24:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I'll be free Monday afternoons
2014-09-27 15:24:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Tuesdays, I'll have class 9a-10:15a and 5p-9p
2014-09-27 15:24:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's cool. It's fine if you have to work in the afternoon on weekdays too.
2014-09-27 15:25:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might have homework on Mondays, but no lab work bc I cant go to the lab on Tuesdays
2014-09-27 15:25:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good I should have plenty to do
2014-09-27 15:26:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'll always be able to keep myself occupied while you're busy
2014-09-27 15:27:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]cool
2014-09-27 15:27:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just wanted to give you a heads up
2014-09-27 15:27:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks, sugar  😘   
2014-09-27 15:29:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ughhh the hangouts smileys are so creepy
2014-09-27 15:29:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you're crazy
2014-09-27 15:29:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the iOS ones are so tacky
2014-09-27 15:30:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]these make me cringe
2014-09-27 15:31:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is creepy about them?
2014-09-27 15:31:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're cute little amorphous blobs
2014-09-27 15:31:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't like the wink
2014-09-27 15:32:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or that a blob is kissing me
2014-09-27 15:32:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha we're so different on this
2014-09-27 15:32:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's really interesting
2014-09-27 15:33:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]different tastes I guess
2014-09-27 15:33:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe because the apple ones are the ones I've seen for so long
2014-09-27 15:33:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm too used to them
2014-09-27 15:34:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that would explain why you like the ones you use
2014-09-27 15:34:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not necessarily why you dislike the Hangouts ones so much
2014-09-27 15:34:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're a little too silly
2014-09-27 15:35:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like that kissy face didn't feel romantic, just really goofy
2014-09-27 15:35:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like the silliness
2014-09-27 15:36:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what does the iOS one look like?
2014-09-27 15:37:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😘
2014-09-27 15:37:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that one's winking too!
2014-09-27 15:37:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I like the wink better
2014-09-27 15:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's so funny how you think the Hangouts ones are more silly
2014-09-27 15:37:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-27 15:39:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Treasure Island has a 10% student discount through october
2014-09-27 15:39:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's interesting
2014-09-27 15:39:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]trying to rope in customers at the start of the school year I guess?
2014-09-27 15:39:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah I guess
2014-09-27 15:40:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]all the Hyde Park grocers are too expensive
2014-09-27 15:43:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you been keeping track of the street sweeping schedule?
2014-09-27 15:44:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yessss
2014-09-27 15:44:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]beginning of october
2014-09-27 15:44:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]is the next cycle
2014-09-27 15:44:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-09-27 16:06:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Im gonna practice for a bit then go for a run
2014-09-27 16:06:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]okey dokey
2014-09-27 19:02:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was the auburn game?
2014-09-27 19:02:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ehhh
2014-09-27 19:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we looked pretty rocky again
2014-09-27 19:02:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the final score was good
2014-09-27 19:02:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but we definitely have some weaknesses that need to be addressed before next week
2014-09-27 19:02:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was practice/running?
2014-09-27 19:08:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was good
2014-09-27 19:08:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This was the first run in a while where I felt like I wasn't struggling 
2014-09-27 19:09:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's good
2014-09-27 19:09:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you do around 4 miles again?
2014-09-27 19:16:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup 
2014-09-27 19:18:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I ran around that park behind the museum of science and industry
2014-09-27 19:18:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which I haven't really done before 
2014-09-27 19:18:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I've been back there
2014-09-27 19:19:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's a pretty Japanese garden 
2014-09-27 19:20:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. That sounds cool.
2014-09-27 19:20:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going over to Brian's in a bit for a sci fi movie night 
2014-09-27 19:20:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A.J.'s Brian?
2014-09-27 19:21:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-27 19:21:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. That sounds like fun.
2014-09-27 19:21:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it's going to be him, krinsky, Erica (postdoc), and Darcy coming later
2014-09-27 19:22:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's being viewed?
2014-09-27 19:22:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dune and the Abyss
2014-09-27 19:22:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-09-27 19:23:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to see Dune
2014-09-27 19:23:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what I really want to see by David Lynch is Eraserhead
2014-09-27 19:23:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't seen that 
2014-09-27 19:24:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I saw it on a list of biggest mindfuck movies
2014-09-27 19:25:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I've heard good things 
2014-09-27 19:26:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hyde park is so crowded tonight 
2014-09-27 19:26:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Jazz Fest?
2014-09-27 19:26:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bc of the Jazz fest I guess
2014-09-27 19:30:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am the worst parallel Parker in the world 
2014-09-27 19:30:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh nooo
2014-09-27 19:30:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-09-27 19:30:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not getting any easier?
2014-09-27 19:30:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have moments of brilliance and ease 
2014-09-27 19:30:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But they're fewer and far between 
2014-09-27 19:31:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my credit rating went up to a 725 on Credit Karma
2014-09-27 19:31:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm also bad at judging where I can fit 
2014-09-27 19:32:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I feel like SUVs/trucks are hard to judge
2014-09-27 19:32:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're not really city vehicles
2014-09-27 19:33:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth 
2014-09-27 19:33:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright well I'm here 
2014-09-27 19:34:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]alright have fun.
2014-09-27 19:34:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Tell everybody I said "hello"
2014-09-27 19:34:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will do!
2014-09-27 20:37:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just saved $2.25 using coupons #thrifty
2014-09-27 20:37:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and remind me not to bike to the grocery store at night again
2014-09-27 20:37:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was stupid
2014-09-27 20:39:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude don't die!
2014-09-27 20:39:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm trying not to
2014-09-27 23:54:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How did your credit score go up?
2014-09-27 23:54:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know, but it went up like 57 points
2014-09-27 23:54:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which puts me at like 725
2014-09-27 23:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and "good"
2014-09-27 23:54:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wooooo
2014-09-27 23:54:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-27 23:55:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We finished the abyss
2014-09-27 23:55:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was it?
2014-09-27 23:55:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good, an entertaining adventure movie 
2014-09-27 23:55:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. No Dune then?
2014-09-27 23:56:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We just started it 
2014-09-27 23:56:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-09-27 23:56:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The abyss extended version was 2.5 hr long
2014-09-27 23:56:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha wow
2014-09-27 23:56:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like Dune is a solid two hours too
2014-09-27 23:57:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah it'll be late 
2014-09-27 23:57:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish you were here!
2014-09-27 23:57:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw. Me too!
2014-09-28 00:21:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you read dune?
2014-09-28 00:22:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have.
2014-09-28 00:22:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Summer 2013
2014-09-28 00:23:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What'd you think?
2014-09-28 00:24:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I liked it. Although, I'm having trouble remembering how it ended right now.
2014-09-28 00:25:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I remember some of the spice descriptions being really psychedelic
2014-09-28 00:25:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah very much so
2014-09-28 00:25:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I remember it felt like the ending was setting up for some big shit about to go down
2014-09-28 00:25:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All about expanding consciousness 
2014-09-28 00:25:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-28 00:25:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was pretty rad
2014-09-28 00:27:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I figured you would like it
2014-09-28 00:28:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dammit I forgot the new season of SNL started tonight
2014-09-28 00:29:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who hosted?
2014-09-28 00:30:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Chris Pratt

2014-09-28 00:31:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least the music bits
2014-09-28 00:31:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah they definitely do, it's pretty lame 
2014-09-28 02:31:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm home

2014-09-28 09:59:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah she's goofy
2014-09-28 09:59:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All about the ALL-CAPS too
2014-09-28 10:00:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like it
2014-09-28 10:01:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Her FB sense of humor is pretty similar to my moms 
2014-09-28 10:09:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was your night?
2014-09-28 10:09:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]were you up at 4?
2014-09-28 10:10:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was asleep by 3
2014-09-28 10:11:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh I guess the other person was up at 4
2014-09-28 10:11:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it said you had a new friend at 4 on Facebook
2014-09-28 10:12:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fun, though?
2014-09-28 10:13:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, only Ben and brian and I made it all the way through dune 
2014-09-28 10:16:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]my audition is at 12
2014-09-28 10:17:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's exciting!
2014-09-28 10:17:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you nervous?
2014-09-28 10:19:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh not really
2014-09-28 10:19:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My period is about to start though so I feel kinda shitty
2014-09-28 10:20:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which can make me stress out 
2014-09-28 10:20:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man. That's a drag.
2014-09-28 10:21:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'll be fine
2014-09-28 10:21:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is pretty low stakes 
2014-09-28 10:23:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I guess that's true
2014-09-28 13:24:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK should I call you call you Katherine or Katie
2014-09-28 13:24:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and what should my parents call you
2014-09-28 13:30:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I told you I don't care what you call me, but if you're referring to me to someone else who calls me Katherine then stick with that to keep it less confusing 
2014-09-28 13:30:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They already call me Katie, it's not a big deal to ask them to change 
2014-09-28 13:31:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meaning: don't tell them to change what they call me
2014-09-28 13:31:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK I'll just get everyone to call you Katherine
2014-09-28 13:32:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not a big deal, really
2014-09-28 13:32:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know, but these rules are confusing for me.
2014-09-28 13:32:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And they barely know you.
2014-09-28 13:32:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So it'll be easier for me and everyone I know to just use Katherine universally.
2014-09-28 13:32:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They aren't rules 
2014-09-28 13:33:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to make a big deal about it
2014-09-28 13:34:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's not a big deal
2014-09-28 13:34:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'll all call you Katherine    😃 
2014-09-28 13:34:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why did this come up?
2014-09-28 13:35:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was saying we went to the Auburn Watch Party
2014-09-28 13:35:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I was like "Katie" or I guess it's "Katherine" now
2014-09-28 13:36:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh I should've never said anything about my name 
2014-09-28 13:37:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate when people say Katie and correct themselves, it makes me feel like I'm stressing people out about it when really I don't care that much 
2014-09-28 13:41:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well they really don't mind
2014-09-28 13:41:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and like I said they barely know you
2014-09-28 13:41:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not going to be a huge adjustment
2014-09-28 13:41:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-09-28 13:41:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my best friend Zack changed his name when he got adopted
2014-09-28 13:42:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we'd known him for like three years
2014-09-28 13:44:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made a mistake ordering a smoothie without knowing the price 
2014-09-28 13:44:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was $7
2014-09-28 13:44:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]zoinks!
2014-09-28 13:44:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's in it?
2014-09-28 13:44:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For like 4 pieces of fruits and some juice
2014-09-28 13:44:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Strawberries, bananas, pineapple 
2014-09-28 13:45:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wow at the Jazz Fest?
2014-09-28 13:46:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-28 15:52:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't even think about just making a cheat sheet just in case we were allowed
2014-09-28 15:53:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad you said that, haha
2014-09-28 15:53:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems so obvious
2014-09-28 16:09:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what can I say, I'm a pro
2014-09-28 16:11:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm making some vegan muffins 
2014-09-28 16:12:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. What does that involve?
2014-09-28 16:17:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Instead if eggs, you whip flax meal with water to make it gelatinous
2014-09-28 16:18:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the applesauce does something too I think
2014-09-28 16:18:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. Have you made them before or just giving them a shot?
2014-09-28 16:19:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nope, I just saw the recipe somewhere and thought they sounded good
2014-09-28 16:20:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're Apple carrot cardamom
2014-09-28 16:20:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I love cardamom
2014-09-28 16:20:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I've had it
2014-09-28 16:21:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a spice
2014-09-28 16:21:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kinda reminds me of apple pie species 
2014-09-28 16:21:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*spices
2014-09-28 16:21:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds tasty!
2014-09-28 16:22:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I went to a show and a half of the Jazz fest thing, came home, and ran
2014-09-28 16:22:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then decided I wanted muffins 
2014-09-28 16:23:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds like an OK day
2014-09-28 16:23:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Could be better
2014-09-28 16:23:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could be doing all those things with you
2014-09-28 16:23:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]...except maybe running lol
2014-09-28 16:23:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]smooooooooootttthhhhhh
2014-09-28 16:24:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm sorry I don't have a PhD and I'm not a runner
2014-09-28 16:24:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're just gonna have to accept me for who I am!
2014-09-28 16:24:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And all my flaws    😉 
2014-09-28 16:24:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I keep telling you I never cared if my dream guy had a PhD.
2014-09-28 16:25:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The running part has been tough, but I'm getting over it  😉
2014-09-28 16:25:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just busting your vagina (????)
2014-09-28 16:26:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What??
2014-09-28 16:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-28 16:26:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was trying to do a female equivalent of I'm just busting your balls
2014-09-28 16:26:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it sounded really bad
2014-09-28 16:29:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah that did not work out my dear
2014-09-28 16:38:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss youuuu

2014-09-28 16:39:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if the party gets moved to Halloween would you want to cancel that mid-November flight?
2014-09-28 16:40:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, I guess it'd depend on how busy I was
2014-09-28 16:40:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we can worry about it if it happens
2014-09-28 16:40:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'd just be seeing a lot in November
2014-09-28 16:40:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like every other week
2014-09-28 16:40:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so we could maybe use those flights for another time
2014-09-28 16:41:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but we'll see what happens
2014-09-28 16:44:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get a message from a Microsoft recruit on LinkedIn
2014-09-28 16:45:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*recruiter

2014-09-28 16:46:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there is an office in Chicago
2014-09-28 16:46:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't know if they have engineers working there
2014-09-28 16:49:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just kidding

2014-09-28 16:50:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK. I guess I don't know why you're kidding?
2014-09-28 16:51:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just teasing then
2014-09-28 16:51:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess I don't understand what there is to tease/joke about it
2014-09-28 17:30:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The muffins turned out pretty dope
2014-09-28 17:30:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they honestly sound pretty good

2014-09-28 19:42:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where I was trying to get boar
2014-09-28 19:42:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I might've
2014-09-28 19:42:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't remember, though
2014-09-28 19:42:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah pretty sure I got rabbit

2014-09-28 19:42:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know if I've actually had rabbit
2014-09-28 19:45:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to see you NOW
2014-09-28 19:46:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you reallly want to give up technology and connectivity like that?
2014-09-28 19:46:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not in two weeks
2014-09-28 19:46:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably not
2014-09-28 19:46:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like my guilt we would be the biggest deterrent, though
2014-09-28 19:47:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I'd want it permanently
2014-09-28 19:47:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but would I enjoy a couple of years disconnected from everything with you on a deserted island?
2014-09-28 19:47:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably
2014-09-28 19:48:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno

2014-09-28 21:43:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Use this chat
2014-09-28 21:43:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I guess so.
2014-09-28 21:44:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really?
2014-09-28 21:44:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah? Is that surprising?
2014-09-28 21:44:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That seems so cliche I guess 
2014-09-28 21:44:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so are heels and short skirts
2014-09-28 21:45:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're different 
2014-09-28 21:45:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how so?
2014-09-28 21:45:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The cliche with sucking on stuff is it "reminds the guy of a blow job"
2014-09-28 21:46:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Short skirts are revealing 
2014-09-28 21:46:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't understand why it's different. Sucking on something seems like it should be more of a turn on than short skirts.
2014-09-28 21:47:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it makes sense 
2014-09-28 21:48:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know about using "Daddy" as a nickname before you're actually a daddy
2014-09-28 21:49:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's ok with me
2014-09-28 21:49:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As in you like it?
2014-09-28 21:49:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as in I'm ok with you not using it
2014-09-28 21:53:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They ruined him!
2014-09-28 21:54:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Turns out humans don't do well in random trials with other humans 
2014-09-28 21:54:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure there are humans who would do really well in that scenario
2014-09-28 21:55:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah that's true 
2014-09-28 21:55:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But then it wouldn't be a representative au sample
2014-09-28 21:55:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*subsample
2014-09-28 21:56:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We should see if UChicago is doing sex experiments.
2014-09-28 21:56:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]she does not look ~48
2014-09-28 21:56:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they were doing MDMA stuff while I was there
2014-09-28 21:56:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]really?
2014-09-28 21:57:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-28 21:57:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hannah signed up, but her schedule didn't work or something
2014-09-28 21:57:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like for human trials with it?
2014-09-28 21:57:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep

2014-09-28 21:57:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-28 21:57:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just like effects I think
2014-09-28 21:57:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they were giving some placebo and some MDMA
2014-09-28 21:58:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh noooooooo
2014-09-28 21:58:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whaaat

2014-09-28 22:04:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder how much our sex influenced our falling in love
2014-09-28 22:05:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hard to say
2014-09-28 22:05:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It probably helped
2014-09-28 22:06:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-28 22:06:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like if we had mediocre sex, it would be one less thing to be super excited about when I see you again
2014-09-28 22:06:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-09-28 22:06:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like it wouldn't have worked in that case
2014-09-28 22:07:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hard to say
2014-09-28 22:07:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm totally ok with having a very excellent love and sex life with you

2014-09-28 22:34:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I muted you and now I can't unmute you
2014-09-28 22:41:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All these titty shots

2014-09-28 22:59:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you disappeared!
2014-09-28 23:31:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to cuddle with you while you fall asleep :(
2014-09-28 23:33:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:(
2014-09-28 23:33:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like when you fall asleep before me
2014-09-28 23:33:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like when I was watching movies this last visit 
2014-09-28 23:34:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I can creepily steal glances at you cuddled up next to me and rub your hair 
2014-09-28 23:34:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I was just thinking it seems like I fall asleep before you usually.
2014-09-28 23:35:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha aw.
2014-09-28 23:35:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can only actually think of one time where I know you fell asleep before me.
2014-09-28 23:36:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which time?
2014-09-28 23:36:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In Raleigh. Your last night on the first trip when you were drunk and passed out.
2014-09-28 23:37:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha yeah
2014-09-28 23:37:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I almost fell asleep before you after we kayaked
2014-09-28 23:37:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You were reading and I was curled up next to you 
2014-09-28 23:37:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But then some titty massages happened
2014-09-28 23:37:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-09-28 23:38:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's kinda interesting that I usually fall asleep first.
2014-09-28 23:38:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think at least half the time it's pretty synchronous 
2014-09-28 23:39:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah that'd make sense.
2014-09-28 23:39:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love sleeping in the same bed as you.
2014-09-28 23:40:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too
2014-09-28 23:40:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And being able to wake up in the middle of the night and wrap my arms around you.
2014-09-28 23:40:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or when I wake up in the morning.
2014-09-28 23:41:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless it's too bright, then you hide under the pillow
2014-09-28 23:41:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha yep.
2014-09-28 23:42:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK I'm making myself sad. Goodnight, sugar. I love you so effing much.
2014-09-28 23:42:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't be sad! I love you too, we're already less than 2 weeks away
2014-09-28 23:43:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yay!
2014-09-29 09:19:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhh I want a lazy day in bed with you
2014-09-29 09:20:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too.
2014-09-29 09:20:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lots of kisses and caresses.
2014-09-29 09:20:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And naked bodies wrapped up together.
2014-09-29 09:25:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And giggling 
2014-09-29 09:25:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love how you make me laugh 
2014-09-29 09:25:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can be pretty goofy too
2014-09-29 09:26:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃  it's fun being goofy with you
2014-09-29 09:26:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and, what a coincidence, I love how you make me laugh too
2014-09-29 09:29:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want a "Katherine looking lovingly into my eyes" moment
2014-09-29 09:30:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lovey dovey eyes!
2014-09-29 09:37:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've got really good lovey dovey eyes.
2014-09-29 09:51:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is say the same about you
2014-09-29 18:18:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Temperature drop of 20 deg today
2014-09-29 18:18:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dammmmnnnn
2014-09-29 18:18:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like it got pretty warm today
2014-09-29 18:19:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Richardson is gonna be hot until Wednesday.
2014-09-29 18:19:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or Thursday I guess
2014-09-29 18:20:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah it was really nice the past few days 
2014-09-29 18:20:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I even got a little tan from Jazz fest
2014-09-29 18:21:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-09-29 18:21:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still have to go back to the museum :((
2014-09-29 18:22:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why the sad face?
2014-09-29 18:22:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You want to be done for the day?
2014-09-29 18:24:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-29 18:24:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to have to go back
2014-09-29 18:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When are you going back?
2014-09-29 18:27:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right now
2014-09-29 18:28:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hopefully I'll be home by 9:30
2014-09-29 18:29:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word... I'm just gonna be studying stupid algortithms all night
2014-09-29 18:31:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!
2014-09-29 18:33:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you seen any of Gotham yet?
2014-09-29 18:33:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No. I see that it started last week, though.
2014-09-29 18:33:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should watch that.
2014-09-29 18:34:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Should we try it out together?
2014-09-29 18:35:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah go ahead and tell me how it is 
2014-09-29 18:36:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-09-29 18:37:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll catch next season with you :)
2014-09-29 18:46:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh the fucking museum security guard gave me shit because my ID is "the old kind", even though it still scans in everywhere 
2014-09-29 18:46:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got it in February!
2014-09-29 18:47:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haven't you been using it?
2014-09-29 18:47:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes! And then he called someone saying I had this outdated id from "probably years ago" and whoever he talked to confirmed that they only switched over this summer
2014-09-29 18:48:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol WTF
2014-09-29 18:48:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's annoying
2014-09-29 18:50:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like you got in then, though?
2014-09-29 18:51:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have until tm to get a new ID 
2014-09-29 18:52:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess my ID won't work anymore
2014-09-29 19:04:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it expired?
2014-09-29 19:04:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no, but I guess it's the old type
2014-09-29 19:05:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it expires at the end of the year anyway
2014-09-29 19:12:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Using some Dead Weather in Gotham
2014-09-29 19:14:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Seems appropriate 
2014-09-29 19:25:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ummm advertising totally just worked on me
2014-09-29 19:25:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$5 KFC fill ups
2014-09-29 19:25:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need to find a KFC close to me
2014-09-29 19:36:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh noooo
2014-09-29 19:37:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is a pretty good deal
2014-09-29 19:39:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The closest KFC is 1.5 miles away, which might be enough of a deterrent, if only because there's a McDonald's 0.5 miles away ;)
2014-09-29 19:41:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You could bike to kfc
2014-09-29 19:41:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's only take like 10 min...
2014-09-29 19:43:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's on my busy street. I guess I could take the sidewalk, though.
2014-09-29 19:44:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would be a tad embarrassing to die over a kfc fill up
2014-09-29 19:45:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It really would.
2014-09-29 20:07:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely worth watching the second episode for me
2014-09-29 21:08:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On my way home!
2014-09-29 21:08:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK!
2014-09-29 21:33:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The last 15 minutes of lab were brutal
2014-09-29 21:33:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was so ready to be out if there
2014-09-29 21:33:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha time just dragging?
2014-09-29 21:36:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, and I was ready to be done for the day
2014-09-29 21:37:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was pretty busy 9a-9p
2014-09-29 21:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a long day
2014-09-29 21:37:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if only I could help you take the edge off
2014-09-29 21:39:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nvmmm
2014-09-29 21:39:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I meant mmmmm
2014-09-29 21:39:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Autocorrect is being sassy
2014-09-29 21:39:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm soooo bored with having sex with you
2014-09-29 21:40:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True, I just keep you around for the foot massages now 
2014-09-29 21:40:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha did I do an OK job on that?
2014-09-29 21:40:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think you gave me an evaluation
2014-09-29 21:44:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was good
2014-09-29 21:44:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was kind of at a weird angle, but that wasn't really your fault
2014-09-29 21:45:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds like there's room for improvement
2014-09-29 21:46:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I loved it, really
2014-09-29 21:47:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just didn't have any back support, so I could relax into a big pile of jelly like I wanted to
2014-09-29 21:47:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'll make sure you have some back support next time then    😃 
2014-09-29 21:48:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love that you wear my shirt all the time
2014-09-29 21:49:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is apparently a scarecrow at some park
2014-09-29 21:49:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that is supposed to be for kids
2014-09-29 21:50:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that my bro's family went to
2014-09-29 21:50:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and this scarecrow is just hilariously (and I think unintentionally) dark
2014-09-29 21:52:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's from the movie Up!
2014-09-29 21:52:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-09-29 21:52:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think they intended it
2014-09-29 21:52:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]all the other scarecrows were very kid friendly, though
2014-09-29 21:52:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like Clifford the Big Red Dog friendly
2014-09-29 21:53:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Were they also dead?
2014-09-29 21:53:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-09-29 21:53:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I'm saying
2014-09-29 21:53:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha it's pretty funny though
2014-09-29 21:56:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A friend of mine from college is in a band now and will be doing a show in November.
2014-09-29 21:56:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-09-29 21:57:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He's a pretty good guitar player, I'm glad the music thing is (at least temporarily) working out 
2014-09-29 21:58:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like so many people in the music program that I knew have already drifted into industry 
2014-09-29 21:58:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean by "industry"?
2014-09-29 21:59:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It'd be interesting to look at the socioeconomic status of people who go into things like music or science
2014-09-29 21:59:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I couldn't think of a better word for "not performing music"
2014-09-29 21:59:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like basic research
2014-09-29 21:59:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A couple are teachers
2014-09-29 22:00:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This one guy is doing sound work for events when he really wanted to do jazz bass
2014-09-29 22:00:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This jazz singer is working with some clothing company in LA
2014-09-29 22:01:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure they're all still doing music in some capacity
2014-09-29 22:01:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you gotta pay the bills, though
2014-09-29 22:01:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I guess that's mostly true 
2014-09-29 22:01:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One guy went to school for music business and now works for a portapotty company 
2014-09-29 22:01:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it actually paid pretty well 
2014-09-29 22:02:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how'd he get that job?
2014-09-29 22:02:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think his dad hooked him up somehow 
2014-09-29 22:02:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-09-29 22:02:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's kinda what I was getting at
2014-09-29 22:03:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if you're going to UM without a scholarship, your parents are probably doing pretty well for themselves 
2014-09-29 22:04:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if your parents are paying for your college in general they're probably doing alright
2014-09-29 22:04:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Should we go to acl this year?
2014-09-29 22:04:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]next year?
2014-09-29 22:06:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I meant to say SXSW 
2014-09-29 22:07:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aren't you gonna be doing something around that time?
2014-09-29 22:07:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have the conference the week after 
2014-09-29 22:08:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it would depend heavily on where I'm at with data analysis 
2014-09-29 22:08:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna try to go to BUKU anyway
2014-09-29 22:08:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you can go to BUKU if you're done with your data analysis!
2014-09-29 22:11:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah the conference is 22-26
2014-09-29 22:12:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And buku is 13-15
2014-09-29 22:12:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I could make it work!
2014-09-29 22:12:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who were you going to go with?
2014-09-29 22:12:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Justin A.
2014-09-29 22:13:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and his friend Kyle who I've known through Justin for a while now
2014-09-29 22:13:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they stayed with me in Chicago for Lolla
2014-09-29 22:13:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*whom I've known
2014-09-29 22:13:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that one is tricky for me
2014-09-29 22:14:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-09-29 22:14:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I don't want to crash a boys weekend 
2014-09-29 22:14:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah you wouldn't be doing that
2014-09-29 22:14:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you met Justin
2014-09-29 22:15:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you know he ain't like that
2014-09-29 22:15:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not even 100% yet, I guess
2014-09-29 22:15:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha that's true 
2014-09-29 22:15:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]depends on where Justin winds up and things
2014-09-29 22:15:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he and Kyle went this year and want to go next time, though
2014-09-29 22:15:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was actually debating going to Mardi Gras, so that could be a lot of Nola in a short period of time lol
2014-09-29 22:16:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh really?
2014-09-29 22:16:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just for the heck of it?
2014-09-29 22:17:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Try to organize a TODB trip with Melinda, Elin, and Veronica 
2014-09-29 22:17:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Melinda lived there so has a place we could stay 
2014-09-29 22:17:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is TODB
2014-09-29 22:18:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Troop of drunk bitches  
2014-09-29 22:19:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone called us that summer after freshman year of college and we thought it wS hilarious 
2014-09-29 22:19:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, at the time, quite accurate 
2014-09-29 22:19:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was about tosay
2014-09-29 22:20:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]y'all get your fair share of beads I imagine?
2014-09-29 22:21:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've only flashed a stranger once, not including the time I was topless in key west. Veronica, however, would probably flash every person she saw.
2014-09-29 22:21:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when was the time you did it?
2014-09-29 22:21:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At Bonnaroo, for a free ice cold Lonestars
2014-09-29 22:22:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was very hot 
2014-09-29 22:22:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lollllllllllllllllllll
2014-09-29 22:22:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And dusty 
2014-09-29 22:22:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I wasn't 21 yet
2014-09-29 22:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lollllllllllllllllllllll
2014-09-29 22:23:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]were you like
2014-09-29 22:23:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Can I have a beer?"
2014-09-29 22:23:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the dude said "If you show me your tits"
2014-09-29 22:23:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, he had a sign 
2014-09-29 22:23:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tits for beer
2014-09-29 22:23:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goddamit I've been living my life the wrong way
2014-09-29 22:23:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or something to that edge g 
2014-09-29 22:23:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*effect
2014-09-29 22:24:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really?
2014-09-29 22:24:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha for sure
2014-09-29 22:26:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder how far you could push  that
2014-09-29 22:26:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's what Burning Mas is for
2014-09-29 22:29:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you really want to see a random woman's vagina that hasn't been washed in 3 days?
2014-09-29 22:29:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bless your heart, not talking about looking
2014-09-29 22:32:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I see 
2014-09-29 22:32:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well then why not get a prostitute?
2014-09-29 22:33:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not as challenging I guess?
2014-09-29 22:33:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the girl actually has to want the sex in some capacity?
2014-09-29 22:33:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a little more spontaneous?
2014-09-29 22:35:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you say I'm the one who might get freaked out by a monogamous relationship lol
2014-09-29 22:51:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love youuu 
2014-09-29 22:59:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too
2014-09-29 23:01:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why not flash your tits at MardiGras?
2014-09-29 23:01:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, I guess I might if the mood strikes me
2014-09-29 23:02:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like you get plenty of beads even without flashing though
2014-09-29 23:02:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the beads aren't the point, lol
2014-09-29 23:02:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I don't necessarily like people yelling at me "show me your tits!"
2014-09-29 23:03:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then why go to Mardi Gras?
2014-09-29 23:04:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if you flash once, they'll keep yelling at you about it 
2014-09-29 23:04:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do they know?
2014-09-29 23:05:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you ever been to Mardi Gras?
2014-09-29 23:05:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you think?
2014-09-29 23:05:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sleepy

2014-09-29 23:06:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight!
2014-09-30 08:02:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mother was going through my sophomore year homecoming pics at 7a....
2014-09-30 08:07:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, I am now totally down to watch Gotham
2014-09-30 13:44:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why haven't you responded to me all dayyyy
2014-09-30 13:47:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't love meeee
2014-09-30 13:48:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or else you have like 10 quizzes this week 
2014-09-30 13:52:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sorry. I don't really get the OC reference, soryr.
2014-09-30 13:53:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how's your day going?
2014-09-30 13:53:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He's an attractive guy that was on the oc that's all
2014-09-30 13:54:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's ok, I have terrible cramps (tmi)
2014-09-30 13:54:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But am getting stuff done
2014-09-30 13:55:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man. Well it's good you're getting stuff done at least.
2014-09-30 13:56:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My Bioinformatics exam is tomorrow instead of the 8th
2014-09-30 13:56:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that makes this week a little more busy than I would've liked
2014-09-30 13:56:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess next week should be relatively chill
2014-09-30 13:56:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's your day?
2014-09-30 13:57:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you just not read the schedule correctly?
2014-09-30 13:57:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No, I did. He changed it.
2014-09-30 13:57:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Without sending an email when the change was made I guess.
2014-09-30 13:57:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know when it was changed.
2014-09-30 13:58:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably when you were with me :)
2014-09-30 13:58:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah you're probably right
2014-09-30 13:58:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Doesn't really matter, though.
2014-09-30 13:58:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We get two front and back pages of notes
2014-09-30 13:58:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the algorithms we've gone over are really straight-forward
2014-09-30 13:59:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I don't know why I'd have any trouble
2014-09-30 13:59:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-09-30 13:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you see my email about the party?
2014-09-30 14:00:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did! Looking forward to it.
2014-09-30 14:00:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought it was funny how you referred to me as Michael A. Alcorn
2014-09-30 14:00:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I considered replying all
2014-09-30 14:00:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Didn't want people to get confused 
2014-09-30 14:02:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Most ppl wouldn't mind, just the ones who actually don't know either of us
2014-09-30 14:03:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just gonna call you out for jinxing Auburn
2014-09-30 14:03:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh you and jinxes 
2014-09-30 14:03:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-30 14:03:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess the game could still be going on when the party starts
2014-09-30 14:04:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But ppl never come until an hour after anyways 
2014-09-30 14:04:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nothing wrong with having it on
2014-09-30 14:04:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man academics are squares
2014-09-30 14:04:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just wouldn't want them to be in yourrr way while you watch it
2014-09-30 14:04:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of course we'll have it on
2014-09-30 14:05:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well that's nice of you
2014-09-30 14:05:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should invite your friend justin too
2014-09-30 14:05:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ehhh
2014-09-30 14:05:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-09-30 14:06:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh he's not actually gonna be in town that weekend anyway
2014-09-30 14:06:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but people in the department don't really like him
2014-09-30 14:06:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha why not?
2014-09-30 14:06:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've told you about this
2014-09-30 14:06:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he dated Joyce for a while
2014-09-30 14:06:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeahhh
2014-09-30 14:07:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I guess half the ppl there wouldn't know that
2014-09-30 14:07:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I wouldn't want it to be awkward for Joyce if she goes
2014-09-30 14:07:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well he's not gonna be in town anyway so it's all good
2014-09-30 14:07:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't even invite him to my going away party
2014-09-30 14:08:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That kinda sucks
2014-09-30 14:08:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes it odes
2014-09-30 14:10:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I Scheduled a payment to you for tm  
2014-09-30 14:10:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for what?
2014-09-30 14:11:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The money you lent me
2014-09-30 14:11:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK I thought we were even with flights and stuff?
2014-09-30 14:13:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I just took of $150 for one of the flights 
2014-09-30 14:13:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I paid you $350
2014-09-30 14:14:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm alright, whatever you think is fair I guess.
2014-09-30 14:16:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This way, you paid for stuff in sept, I paid for oct 10, you paid for Halloween and some of nov 15, and I'm hosting you for thanksgiving 
2014-09-30 14:17:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, my family is
2014-09-30 14:19:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds good 😘
2014-09-30 14:23:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just got paid $900 by Red Hat too so I'm making all kinds of money.
2014-09-30 14:23:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woohoo
2014-09-30 14:24:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is that your first paycheck for remote work?
2014-09-30 14:25:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yep.
2014-09-30 14:27:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For 2 weeks? That's crazy 
2014-09-30 14:27:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mom forgave an extra $100 from my debt to her. She said to take you out to a nice dinner for your birthday 
2014-09-30 14:29:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha aw that's nice of her.
2014-09-30 14:30:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What kind of cake should I make?
2014-09-30 14:30:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or rather, what kinds should I not make 
2014-09-30 14:31:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This paycheck is a little bigger than normal because one week had an extra 2.5 hours from that Sunday I worked and I got four hours of holiday pay.
2014-09-30 14:31:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It'll be closer to $800 usually I think.
2014-09-30 14:32:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know what do you have in mind?
2014-09-30 14:32:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could make anything 
2014-09-30 14:32:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My mom's thing is making ice cream cake, but that doesn't really mean anything for you haha
2014-09-30 14:33:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do youuu like?
2014-09-30 14:33:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Chocolate stuff? Fruity stuff?
2014-09-30 14:33:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cheesecake?
2014-09-30 14:34:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Butterscotch/caramel?
2014-09-30 14:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like cake in general. You should come up with something you want to make and check with me.
2014-09-30 14:34:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is there anything you don't like?
2014-09-30 14:34:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nuts? 
2014-09-30 14:34:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Peanut butter?
2014-09-30 14:42:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I'd want nuts in my cake. I like peanut butter, though.
2014-09-30 14:45:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm leaning towards upgrading my phone sooner rather than later again.
2014-09-30 14:47:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I figure if I get a good job I'll be able to just upgrade when I want.
2014-09-30 14:51:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly!
2014-09-30 14:52:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You could even give me the "shitty" phone
2014-09-30 15:01:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha that's true I guess. But the fact that my phone hasn't notified me for several of the messages you've sent me in this conversation is realllllyyyy annoying.
2014-09-30 15:35:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The soda fountain in the dining hall occasionally gets weird and makes drinks taste gross. Today was one of those days :(
2014-09-30 16:23:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry my phone died and I was at the field without a charger 
2014-09-30 16:24:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should ask for a refund 
2014-09-30 16:24:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I dumped it out and didn't pay for it
2014-09-30 16:24:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-30 16:24:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Still sad to be soda-less though
2014-09-30 16:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it really was.
2014-09-30 16:25:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I totally get a little happiness from a solid Coke.
2014-09-30 16:25:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK quiz time!
2014-09-30 16:25:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good luck! Knock em dead!
2014-09-30 16:26:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, any chance you want to go to Vegas, Tampa, or Miami next year for $30? Much more important:  http://wgntv.com/2014/09/30/frontier-airlines-offers-14-99-one-way-flights-from-chicago-ohare/

2014-09-30 17:59:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bummer, I was thinking we could do a 2 night getaway in Miami for my bday 
2014-09-30 17:59:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should've just bought them haha
2014-09-30 18:00:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well they have change fees and stuff
2014-09-30 18:01:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it was only a $30 gamble
2014-09-30 18:01:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good
2014-09-30 18:01:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in the future
2014-09-30 18:01:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also we would've just gotten back from Florida 
2014-09-30 18:01:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have my permission to get tickets like that
2014-09-30 18:01:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll pay you my share if it doesn't work out
2014-09-30 18:01:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok ok, next time 
2014-09-30 18:02:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to?
2014-09-30 18:02:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The flights I wanted were probably sold out at 5p anyways I didn't really check 
2014-09-30 18:02:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got out of TA training course 
2014-09-30 18:02:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was it?

2014-09-30 18:07:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is the last time I can probably go this quarter 
2014-09-30 18:07:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because of band 
2014-09-30 18:07:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, word

2014-09-30 18:10:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'll definitely jump back on the trivia team when I'm back, but I probably won't be driving people if we're not in Hyde Park
2014-09-30 18:11:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just meant when you visit and I have band until 9:30
2014-09-30 18:12:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooooh
2014-09-30 18:12:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I probably won't do that.
2014-09-30 18:12:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Trivia can go kinda late.
2014-09-30 18:12:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that'll be the last night I spend with you.

2014-09-30 23:04:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was permit only, but the signs were like 50+ ft away either direction of where we parked 
2014-09-30 23:05:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that definitely sucks
2014-09-30 23:06:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you have a good time otherwise?
2014-09-30 23:07:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-09-30 23:07:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We did pretty mediocre at trivia

2014-09-30 23:09:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Stop going to school 
2014-09-30 23:09:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt I would've got that one, though
2014-09-30 23:09:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Everyone loves shakira
2014-09-30 23:09:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why do you know that?
2014-09-30 23:10:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I came across it at some point 
2014-09-30 23:10:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And they said the artist wasn't born in the US
2014-09-30 23:10:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So it had to be Latin America 
2014-09-30 23:10:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a vital hint
2014-09-30 23:11:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes 
2014-09-30 23:11:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still doubt I would've got it
2014-09-30 23:11:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There were at least 4 questions that Sara or I said the answer and it was swept away by rob or Laura 
2014-09-30 23:12:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where you were right?
2014-09-30 23:12:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-09-30 23:12:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man.
2014-09-30 23:12:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I never think I'm right 
2014-09-30 23:12:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well then why would they think you're right
2014-09-30 23:12:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-30 23:13:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😔
2014-09-30 23:13:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Laura also intimidates me a little
2014-09-30 23:13:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-09-30 23:15:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not as much after tonight 
2014-09-30 23:16:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But she comes across a little bit like someone that would jump on you if you say something stupid 
2014-09-30 23:16:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely
2014-09-30 23:16:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And as a first year I especially felt that everything I thought was stupid 
2014-09-30 23:17:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that makes sense
2014-09-30 23:17:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she was only a year ahead of me
2014-09-30 23:17:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also being in EvProcesses helped me realize I'm definitely on the same level as most everyone else in the program  
2014-09-30 23:17:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I've ever felt intimidated by a grad student, though
2014-09-30 23:17:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's good
2014-09-30 23:18:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Victoria (a 2nd year) used to kind of intimidate me
2014-09-30 23:19:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I remember you saying that
2014-09-30 23:19:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But now I've just realized she's not a very nice person 
2014-09-30 23:19:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-09-30 23:19:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no kidding
2014-09-30 23:20:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She makes negative, shallow judgements about people behind their back 
2014-09-30 23:20:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yikes
2014-09-30 23:20:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And according to Haley, told max a straight up lie about Haley shit talking Karen
2014-09-30 23:20:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you baen judged?
2014-09-30 23:20:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Almost certainly 
2014-09-30 23:20:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who is Karen
2014-09-30 23:20:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But not to my face 
2014-09-30 23:20:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Max's long time on and off gf
2014-09-30 23:20:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I figured that, just didn't know if you'd heard something
2014-09-30 23:21:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah shit
2014-09-30 23:21:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I always forget her name
2014-09-30 23:21:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never met her
2014-09-30 23:21:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but he always seems to mention her haha
2014-09-30 23:21:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's pretty bad
2014-09-30 23:22:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Max wouldn't speak to Haley for a few weeks, and then finally confronted her about it and she was really confused 
2014-09-30 23:22:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anyways
2014-09-30 23:22:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What've you been up to?
2014-09-30 23:22:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just studying a bit
2014-09-30 23:23:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so much drama in the cluster, man
2014-09-30 23:23:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]y'all need to mellow
2014-09-30 23:24:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously I only tell you the interesting dramatic parts 
2014-09-30 23:24:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't recall this much drama going on while I was there
2014-09-30 23:24:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like ppl like Supriya never experience drama 
2014-09-30 23:24:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but maybe I was out of the loop
2014-09-30 23:24:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It seems like there's a fair amount of drama surrounding Joyce 
2014-09-30 23:25:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Max 
2014-09-30 23:25:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Joyce still has drama?
2014-09-30 23:25:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or you mean while I was there?
2014-09-30 23:25:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess mostly while you were there
2014-09-30 23:26:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dating Tom, and you're friend, and whoever the dude wS she lived with that was a total jerk to her
2014-09-30 23:26:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is dude #3 not the same dude as my friend?
2014-09-30 23:27:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe?
2014-09-30 23:27:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Does he play WoW?
2014-09-30 23:27:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like how the cluster would describe him
2014-09-30 23:27:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]LoL
2014-09-30 23:28:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe they are the same ppl. That would make sense
2014-09-30 23:28:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty sure we discussed this all before
2014-09-30 23:28:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you weren't that invested
2014-09-30 23:28:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-30 23:29:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry 
2014-09-30 23:29:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't do that
2014-09-30 23:29:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't do what
2014-09-30 23:30:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"I guess you weren't that invested"
2014-09-30 23:30:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Passive aggressively making me feel bad about forgetting details of a conversation we had 
2014-09-30 23:31:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't realize that was passive aggressive
2014-09-30 23:31:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe just aggressive then 
2014-09-30 23:31:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aight
2014-09-30 23:34:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I'm cranky 
2014-09-30 23:35:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good
2014-09-30 23:38:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-09-30 23:39:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thinking about the night we watched treasure planet made me pretty happy 
2014-09-30 23:39:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too
2014-09-30 23:40:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was when I officially acknowledged that what we had wasn't some crazy whirlwind fluke 
2014-09-30 23:41:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah?
2014-09-30 23:41:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when did we watch that?
2014-09-30 23:41:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The first time I visited you, right?
2014-09-30 23:41:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]After eating hamburger helper 
2014-09-30 23:41:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, you're right
2014-09-30 23:42:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it was Treasure Planet that sealed the deal, huh?
2014-09-30 23:42:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was that whole visit 
2014-09-30 23:43:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Validation that I wasn't just suffering temporary insanity those 3 days in March
2014-09-30 23:43:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you are pretty cute when you're sleepy 
2014-09-30 23:43:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha making sure it wasn't just cuz I broke your "drought"
2014-09-30 23:44:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I
2014-09-30 23:44:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]'m definitely exceptionally sleepy around you
2014-09-30 23:44:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it's the increased sex 
2014-09-30 23:44:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]2-4 times a day is really quite a lot 
2014-09-30 23:45:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I guess watching movies in the dark is a no no for you 
2014-09-30 23:45:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get that that's a lot of sex
2014-09-30 23:45:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but is it really that exhausting?
2014-09-30 23:46:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess there are some hormones working too
2014-09-30 23:46:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, you hear that some chemicals released after sex can make men sleepy 
2014-09-30 23:46:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, maybe they accumulate 
2014-09-30 23:46:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe sperm production requires increased metabolic rate 
2014-09-30 23:47:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-09-30 23:47:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was actually wondering if the force of my ejaculation went down
2014-09-30 23:47:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with each time
2014-09-30 23:48:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz that time I came on your tits didn't seem particularly forceful
2014-09-30 23:48:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure it does 
2014-09-30 23:49:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The volume almost certainly does 
2014-09-30 23:49:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, for sure
2014-09-30 23:50:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Come here and cum on meeee
2014-09-30 23:51:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish.
2014-09-30 23:51:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's so effing sexy too.
2014-09-30 23:52:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That time you came on my tits and then fingered me was pretty fucking sexy 
2014-09-30 23:52:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like top 10 sexiest moments 
2014-09-30 23:52:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you know I have to ask what the other nine are now.
2014-09-30 23:52:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I agree. That was pretty hot all around.
2014-09-30 23:52:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The lighting was good too
2014-09-30 23:53:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I dunno I'll have to think about it 
2014-09-30 23:53:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's #1?
2014-09-30 23:54:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sexiest is kinda hard to quantify 
2014-09-30 23:54:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I know my best orgasm 
2014-09-30 23:54:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I know the best single session of sex 
2014-09-30 23:54:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you know you're single best orgasm
2014-09-30 23:54:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and single best time of sex?
2014-09-30 23:55:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*your
2014-09-30 23:55:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ick
2014-09-30 23:55:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think so
2014-09-30 23:55:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when?
2014-09-30 23:56:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Either the morning after we rolled or an afternoon in raleigh my 1st visit 
2014-09-30 23:56:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is this sex session or orgasm?
2014-09-30 23:56:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Orgasm 
2014-09-30 23:56:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-09-30 23:58:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I can't pick a sex session off the top of my head
2014-09-30 23:58:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There are a few tied 
2014-09-30 23:58:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That one where I rode you backwards for a bit was pretty good, but it's also most recent so it's probably inflated 
2014-09-30 23:59:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-09-30 23:59:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you really liked that huh?
2014-09-30 23:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I liked the change up, and the way you grabbed my ass
2014-09-30 23:59:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it felt good
2014-09-30 23:59:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was a pretty big fan too
2014-10-01 00:01:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That time you started with a massage was really sexy 
2014-10-01 00:01:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that was pretty fun
2014-10-01 00:02:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like getting to touch all over you body
2014-10-01 00:02:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mmmhmm
2014-10-01 00:03:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the one time on your couch over my spring break was good
2014-10-01 00:03:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was good 
2014-10-01 00:03:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mostly remember the post orgasm chest snuggle 
2014-10-01 00:04:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-10-01 00:04:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm sure everything that came before it to make me feel that way was pretty stellar too
2014-10-01 00:05:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'll take cuddling compliments
2014-10-01 00:05:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You deserve them 
2014-10-01 00:06:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we definitely have bomb cuddle chemistry
2014-10-01 00:06:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, it's time for me to sleep 
2014-10-01 00:06:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-10-01 00:06:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Talking about cuddling makes me sad :(
2014-10-01 00:06:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw
2014-10-01 00:06:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]10 days?
2014-10-01 00:07:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-10-01 00:07:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can't wait 
2014-10-01 00:07:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight, I love you so much
2014-10-01 00:08:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too.
2014-10-01 00:08:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I literally thought to myself "I hit the jackpot" when thinking about you today
2014-10-01 00:08:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, I hit the jackpot 
2014-10-01 00:09:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha the fact that you think that makes me believe I hit the jackpot even more
2014-10-01 00:09:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm so lucky.
2014-10-01 00:09:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much.
2014-10-01 00:09:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love sharing my life with you.
2014-10-01 00:10:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I can't wait to keep sharing it with you.
2014-10-01 00:11:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sharing it every night! In person! Eating Popsicles in bed and giggling and staring into each other's eyes! 
2014-10-01 00:11:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yessss
2014-10-01 00:11:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just sharing everything
2014-10-01 00:11:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]big awesome moments and little mundane shit
2014-10-01 00:11:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's gonna be amazing
2014-10-01 00:12:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want the little mundane shit so bad 
2014-10-01 00:12:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me toooo
2014-10-01 00:13:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is just one more reason why I think we're perfect for each other
2014-10-01 00:14:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd actually say it's a fairly big reason
2014-10-01 00:14:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That we want to spend the rest of our lives together? 
2014-10-01 00:14:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because I guess that's what that boils down to
2014-10-01 00:14:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no that doesn't mean anything
2014-10-01 00:15:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well
2014-10-01 00:15:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't think all couples really necessarily want to share mundane moments together
2014-10-01 00:15:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well they should 
2014-10-01 00:15:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-01 00:15:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If they want to spend the rest of their lives together 
2014-10-01 00:15:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean more like
2014-10-01 00:16:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-10-01 00:16:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it's a bad thing
2014-10-01 00:16:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like some people just aren't that affectionate?
2014-10-01 00:16:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if that's the right word
2014-10-01 00:16:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I just like being around you
2014-10-01 00:16:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't "need my space"
2014-10-01 00:16:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well also right now every moment together is precious 
2014-10-01 00:17:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's true
2014-10-01 00:17:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we'll chill out a bit once we see each other every day 
2014-10-01 00:17:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I will
2014-10-01 00:17:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean if we're both home basically
2014-10-01 00:18:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not gonna want to be away from you
2014-10-01 00:18:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't have to be cuddling with you
2014-10-01 00:18:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'd want to be in the same room probably most of the time
2014-10-01 00:18:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:) that's sweet
2014-10-01 00:19:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess who knows how things will be
2014-10-01 00:19:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Amazing 
2014-10-01 00:19:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They'll be amazing 
2014-10-01 00:19:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, now I really am crashing 
2014-10-01 00:20:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-01 00:20:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight
2014-10-01 00:20:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you
2014-10-01 00:20:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you, too
2014-10-01 07:19:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh I slept terrible. At one point I woke up and I swear. I saw a mass of writhing dead hands hovering over the foot of my bed. Even when I blinked they stayed there. When I turned on my lamp it was just a towel over the fan 
2014-10-01 07:19:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wtf
2014-10-01 08:31:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's so creepy!
2014-10-01 08:32:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-10-01 08:32:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes it was
2014-10-01 08:34:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like where does that even come from? Haha
2014-10-01 08:40:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you.
2014-10-01 08:43:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who knows man 
2014-10-01 08:43:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you too
2014-10-01 08:44:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could've used some backup for my reality check last night lol
2014-10-01 08:45:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I'll make sure to keep the dead hands away when we live together.
2014-10-01 08:51:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-10-01 08:58:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should be better about writing down where i parked
2014-10-01 08:58:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I never had to deal with that
2014-10-01 08:58:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems annoying
2014-10-01 09:00:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also Supriya texted me at like 10 last night asking for a ride this morning so now she's waiting on me
2014-10-01 09:01:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how late are you?
2014-10-01 09:02:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I told her btwn 8:45-9
2014-10-01 09:02:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, well did you text her saying you're gonna be a few late?
2014-10-01 09:03:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She texted saying she decide to walk toy place
2014-10-01 09:03:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-10-01 09:03:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where are you going?
2014-10-01 09:10:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Museum 
2014-10-01 09:10:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just told her to take the 6
2014-10-01 09:10:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-10-01 09:21:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Found it
2014-10-01 09:22:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]53 and university 
2014-10-01 09:22:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh wow. You've been looking this whole time?
2014-10-01 09:22:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found it 5 min ago
2014-10-01 09:22:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's still a bit of time
2014-10-01 09:23:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-10-01 09:35:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well today's the last day I can drive anyways 
2014-10-01 09:35:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why's that?
2014-10-01 09:36:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]when I went to get my new pass they said students can no longer park 
2014-10-01 09:36:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Man, that's some bull shit.
2014-10-01 09:37:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can pay $6 a day if I want 
2014-10-01 09:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's garbage
2014-10-01 09:37:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which I guess is only $1.50 more than the bus
2014-10-01 09:37:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]True.
2014-10-01 09:38:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But then I'm also paying for gas
2014-10-01 09:38:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why are they doing that?
2014-10-01 09:42:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess some new person in administration has slowly been taking away studebt privileges 
2014-10-01 09:42:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can only sign in one guest now
2014-10-01 09:42:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That seems so antagonistic
2014-10-01 09:42:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why would you want to screw the students?
2014-10-01 09:44:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does a smaller percentage of your paycheck get taken out if you're making less money?
2014-10-01 10:04:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-10-01 10:06:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my net on my last paycheck was a higher % than it was over the summer
2014-10-01 10:06:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got 79.8569065% of this paycheck
2014-10-01 10:06:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're probably my in a different pay class
2014-10-01 10:07:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I was getting 75.779326923% over the summer
2014-10-01 10:07:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-01 10:07:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's like an extra free 2.5 hours of work
2014-10-01 10:07:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's a good chance you'll get a dope tax refund 
2014-10-01 10:08:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be sweet
2014-10-01 11:21:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm dropping stats until next quarter 
2014-10-01 11:21:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're offering another session of this class
2014-10-01 11:21:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel much much more relieved 
2014-10-01 11:21:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's good.
2014-10-01 11:22:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't realize you were feeling stressed about it.
2014-10-01 11:22:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was stressed about the lab work 
2014-10-01 11:22:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's why I was gonna have to work weekends and until 9 on Wednesdays
2014-10-01 11:23:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because I couldn't really go to the museum at all tues/thurs
2014-10-01 11:23:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, OK.
2014-10-01 11:23:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So this makes your schedule a lot more reasonable it sounds like.
2014-10-01 11:24:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hopefully, and more likely you can come earlier in dec
2014-10-01 11:24:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'd like that :0
2014-10-01 11:24:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whoops
2014-10-01 11:24:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-10-01 11:36:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made the wind ensemble!
2014-10-01 11:36:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yay!!! Congratulations    😃 
2014-10-01 11:37:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'll be fun
2014-10-01 11:37:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the practices are on Tuesday nights?
2014-10-01 11:37:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]7-9:30
2014-10-01 11:37:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I assume I won't play on every piece 
2014-10-01 11:38:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So maybe less than that some nights
2014-10-01 11:39:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool. Well I'm looking forward to the performance!
2014-10-01 14:52:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cam sent me a snap chat of a picture of a tuba player with the message "How did the audition go"
2014-10-01 14:52:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Weird 
2014-10-01 14:52:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha is it?
2014-10-01 14:53:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hannah actually texted me yesterday.
2014-10-01 14:53:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We had a friendly chat.
2014-10-01 14:55:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What'd you chat about?
2014-10-01 14:56:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]She said she had the "grad school blues"
2014-10-01 14:56:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So she talked about what she's up to.
2014-10-01 14:56:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was gonna tell you yesterday, but I must've forgot.
2014-10-01 14:57:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All my exes have had problems with me talking to exes, and I don't really want that to be an issue with us.
2014-10-01 14:57:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you don't have any "insignificant" exes haha
2014-10-01 14:58:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-10-01 14:59:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess as long as you're upfront about it I don't care 
2014-10-01 15:01:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd feel a littlleeee bit better about it if she knew you had a girlfriend 
2014-10-01 15:01:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I know that's kind of awkward to just bring up out of the blue
2014-10-01 15:01:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-10-01 15:01:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]be like
2014-10-01 15:02:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Yo, I'm moving in with this chick I've been dating for six months."
2014-10-01 15:02:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"I'm planning on marrying her and having kids with her."
2014-10-01 15:03:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well now you just make us sound crazy 
2014-10-01 15:04:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you interact with your exes?
2014-10-01 15:06:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Rarely. I think I told you I got the impression Reuel was a little more bummed that I had found someone else than he had initially let on so I haven't really talked to him at all since spring 
2014-10-01 15:06:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Scott and I had a brief FB chat about housing options for my friend Melinda 
2014-10-01 15:07:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And buying drugs from cam 
2014-10-01 15:07:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think Brett counts as an ex
2014-10-01 15:08:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-01 15:10:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My comment about cams snap was more about how it was a really odd medium for a conversation like that
2014-10-01 15:10:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really have no idea what y'all's relationship is like
2014-10-01 15:11:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I have no conception of what is weird or not
2014-10-01 15:11:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All I know is he got stalker-ish for a while.
2014-10-01 15:11:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But that you didn't sever ties.
2014-10-01 15:11:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I don't really know how to interpret your situation.
2014-10-01 15:13:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We didn't interact at all from like oct to after we started dating 
2014-10-01 15:13:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He asked to be my fb friend some time after the new year and I said yes just because I didn't want him to bug me about it 
2014-10-01 15:15:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I guess he sent a text in January out of the blue essentially asking if an Instagram picture of a cheesecake I'd posted was a tbt to the one i made him for his birthday 
2014-10-01 15:16:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no shit
2014-10-01 15:16:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was it?
2014-10-01 15:17:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, it was a completely different looking cheesecake I made for Simons one Sunday 
2014-10-01 15:17:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I didn't think so
2014-10-01 15:17:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-01 15:18:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn, dude.
2014-10-01 15:18:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd feel bad for him if it wasn't for the stalker shit.
2014-10-01 15:18:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd send you the literally insane messages he sent me, but that'd probably be rude. 
2014-10-01 15:20:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha, I don't particularly want to see them I guess.
2014-10-01 15:20:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you've made it pretty clear he was doing messed up shit.
2014-10-01 16:39:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh hell yes. Bioinformatics is a cakewalk class.
2014-10-01 16:41:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The test was a joke?
2014-10-01 17:18:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-10-01 17:18:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It might've been the easiest exam I've ever taken.
2014-10-01 17:19:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely didn't get the notification that you sent that message, though.
2014-10-01 17:19:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fucking phone.
2014-10-01 17:20:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hangouts is trying to break us up
2014-10-01 17:20:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha, but it's been so instrumental in our development
2014-10-01 17:21:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from professing our love to proposing for marriage
2014-10-01 17:21:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should make Hangouts my best man
2014-10-01 17:21:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It makes sense that it's involved in our demise 
2014-10-01 17:21:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-10-01 17:21:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-10-01 17:21:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you!
2014-10-01 17:22:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are you up to?
2014-10-01 17:22:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]About to go to zumbaaaa
2014-10-01 17:22:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then Haley and I are going to get manicures 
2014-10-01 17:22:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fun fun
2014-10-01 17:23:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The reviews on this place said sometimes they give you free shoulder massages
2014-10-01 17:23:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fingers crossed
2014-10-01 17:23:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha good luck
2014-10-01 17:25:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's nice to have a girl friend here 
2014-10-01 17:25:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think that's part of the reason I was feeling kinda down last year 
2014-10-01 17:26:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I can definitely relate to that.
2014-10-01 17:26:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess y'all didn't start hanging out until later in the year?
2014-10-01 17:28:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, SICB was the first time we had really interacted socially. And then we didn't really hang out until broomball 
2014-10-01 17:29:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, well I'm glad you guys hang out. I've been a fan of Haley since she interviewed!
2014-10-01 17:31:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might be kinda tired for my party.
2014-10-01 17:31:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Better not get delayed too!
2014-10-01 17:40:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Got my application fee back too.
2014-10-01 17:40:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's another $150
2014-10-01 20:13:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why will you be tired?
2014-10-01 20:13:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Early flight.
2014-10-01 20:14:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhh you don't come in friday?
2014-10-01 20:14:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope

2014-10-01 20:20:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't ask for Rsvps, but everyone I've talked to except Supriya  
2014-10-01 20:20:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They better be, BC I'm sure not getting you one 
2014-10-01 20:21:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I get a present when I give you a present, so it'll work out.

2014-10-01 20:25:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]euphemism

2014-10-01 20:29:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought we talked about it on Hangouts
2014-10-01 20:29:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I can't seem to find it
2014-10-01 20:30:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought we talked in person 
2014-10-01 20:30:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you search "Lolita"
2014-10-01 20:30:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-10-01 20:30:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did
2014-10-01 20:30:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]stupid real life not being searchable
2014-10-01 20:30:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One day 
2014-10-01 20:33:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it was Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?
2014-10-01 20:34:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or maybe Foundation
2014-10-01 20:34:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was sci-fi I think
2014-10-01 20:35:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dune?
2014-10-01 20:35:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-01 20:40:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Does that mean not dune?
2014-10-01 20:40:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, you asked me if I've ever read that the other night.
2014-10-01 20:40:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh my god! You're doing it again
2014-10-01 20:41:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jeez, you can't even remember what you said the other night
2014-10-01 20:42:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't know what you remember from our conversations.
2014-10-01 20:42:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not mad about it.
2014-10-01 20:42:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even really know what I just did.
2014-10-01 20:42:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said you asked me the other night.
2014-10-01 20:43:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which is true?
2014-10-01 20:43:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was how you responded with "haha" initially. You can just say, "remember, I told you the other night I've read that book"
2014-10-01 20:46:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Stuff like that might take me a time or two to remember 
2014-10-01 20:46:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially when we talk late at night after I've been working all day
2014-10-01 20:47:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's actually the second time it's come up
2014-10-01 20:48:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-10-01 20:48:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was gonna ask if you wanted to video tonight, but I'm pretty tired and will probably forget the finer details of what we talk about 
2014-10-01 20:49:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'll talk to you tm
2014-10-01 20:49:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yuck.
2014-10-01 20:49:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-01 20:50:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude it clearly bothers you a little bit I don't remember stuff from our conversations 
2014-10-01 20:50:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you express it like you're making fun of me for it
2014-10-01 20:50:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dude, I don't care. I honestly thought there was a chance you were making a joke.
2014-10-01 20:51:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you might be kinda forgetful
2014-10-01 20:51:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll keep that in mind going forward.
2014-10-01 20:56:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I thought you were blowing me off for not remembering 
2014-10-01 20:56:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fucking texting 
2014-10-01 20:56:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really did want to video with you though 
2014-10-01 20:57:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mighttt still be convinced to 
2014-10-01 20:57:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you want
2014-10-01 21:00:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah we can do that
2014-10-01 21:04:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok lemme get all my electronics in order 
2014-10-01 21:12:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're being slow 
2014-10-01 21:13:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-10-01 21:13:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hangouts won't connect for some reason 
2014-10-01 21:13:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on your Mac?
2014-10-01 21:13:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-10-01 21:14:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've had that happen to me a couple of times
2014-10-01 21:14:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]something about a server error?

2014-10-01 22:52:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I'm on bacon duty
2014-10-01 22:53:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This makes a fair amount of sense though 
2014-10-01 22:54:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've heard rumors of orgasms from nipple play
2014-10-02 00:24:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I was such a whiny bum tonight 
2014-10-02 00:26:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm hormonal and feeling a little burnt out and am frustrated because I know if you were here I'd be so much happier 
2014-10-02 00:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's OK. I love you.
2014-10-02 00:31:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I still miss you.
2014-10-02 00:32:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]9 more days 
2014-10-02 08:55:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've lost 5 lbs since I got back from visiting you
2014-10-02 08:59:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wow that's a lot.
2014-10-02 09:00:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's what you were going for?
2014-10-02 09:07:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kinda, I didn't really have a goal number. But I was actively trying to cut out some alcohol and bacon on top of excerpting again 
2014-10-02 09:07:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*exercising 
2014-10-02 09:08:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for Vegas or just in general?
2014-10-02 09:08:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Both. Also when I got back I was probably carrying a lot of water weight from eating so much sodium
2014-10-02 09:09:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was almost the heaviest I've ever been
2014-10-02 09:09:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And one of my skinny jeans I got last winter didn't fit very well :/
2014-10-02 09:10:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you feel better now?
2014-10-02 09:11:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-10-02 09:13:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's good
2014-10-02 09:13:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can show your titties with pride    😉 
2014-10-02 09:14:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, you might think it's bullshit but I really do hate tan lines
2014-10-02 09:14:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And love the feeling of sun on my tits
2014-10-02 09:28:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't bottoms give you tanlines?
2014-10-02 09:38:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess Euro-style bathing probably means you wear bottoms
2014-10-02 09:39:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like the images used on the Mirage's website are meant to titillate
2014-10-02 09:39:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but maybe I'm wrong
2014-10-02 09:40:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]everyone who goes there only wants to avoid tan lines and feel the sun on their chest
2014-10-02 09:40:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and dude's definitely aren't going to look at tits
2014-10-02 09:40:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*dudes
2014-10-02 09:41:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am done talking to you about this
2014-10-02 09:48:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let's just talk when you get back Monday
2014-10-02 09:48:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Stop acting like this
2014-10-02 09:49:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like you're indirectly trying to make me feel bad about the trip 
2014-10-02 09:49:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not.
2014-10-02 09:49:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do think you're being coy.
2014-10-02 09:50:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes, going to that pool (if we do it) is a bit about the experience too
2014-10-02 09:51:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And most people there are probably going for the experience 
2014-10-02 09:52:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not planning on rubbing my bare breasts on anyone though, and would honestly rather just like the opportunity to lie by the pool and tan
2014-10-02 09:54:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you're going to act like this though, where you spiral into self propelled antagonistic comments (similar to the ones you did last Friday when I talked about going out)
2014-10-02 09:54:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then I don't want to talk to you until I get back 
2014-10-02 09:56:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'd really prefer that not to happen 
2014-10-02 17:52:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, Cam and I are your best friends on Snapchat  ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤ ❤    
2014-10-02 19:23:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-10-02 20:16:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where'd you meet that puppy?
2014-10-02 20:17:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's David's dad's dog.
2014-10-02 20:17:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Soooo much nicer than little shithead
2014-10-02 20:17:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he's chilling in my room right now just laying on the floor
2014-10-02 20:17:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he's come in for pets throughout the day
2014-10-02 20:18:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he even makes little shithead chill out a bit it seems
2014-10-02 20:18:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz this dog doesn't freak out when I leave or come home
2014-10-02 20:18:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and little shithead seems to be following him all over the place
2014-10-02 20:18:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's nice
2014-10-02 20:19:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]little shithead reminds me of one of those people who just follow around the "cool kids" and don't ever voice their own opinions
2014-10-02 20:20:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So when he has no one to follow around he just acts obnoxious?
2014-10-02 20:20:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha pretty much
2014-10-02 20:27:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How has your day been?
2014-10-02 20:29:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not too bad. 2 reading groups, some grant writing, and TA class
2014-10-02 20:29:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice.
2014-10-02 20:30:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess my manager talked to one of the VPs at Red Hat about my work.
2014-10-02 20:30:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the guy was digging it.
2014-10-02 20:31:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's exciting 
2014-10-02 20:51:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Seems like your manager does that a lot 
2014-10-02 20:51:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which is good for you
2014-10-02 20:52:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for sure.
2014-10-02 20:52:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you excited for Vegas yet?
2014-10-02 20:52:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah pretty excited
2014-10-02 20:52:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's the weather like there?
2014-10-02 20:52:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My flight is at 6;45a though 
2014-10-02 20:53:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hot I magine?

2014-10-02 20:53:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you and Haley on the same flight?
2014-10-02 20:54:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The high is low 90s and low is mid 60s
2014-10-02 20:54:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it's a dry heat 
2014-10-02 20:54:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's actually not bad
2014-10-02 20:54:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-02 20:54:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Our flights are at the same time, but from different airports 
2014-10-02 20:54:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She doesn't like SWA

2014-10-02 20:57:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-02 21:00:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Laundry is such a drag
2014-10-02 21:01:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you know... it's not so bad when you have a washer and dryer in your place
2014-10-02 21:01:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-02 21:02:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never had that since graduating high school

2014-10-02 21:02:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had it for three years in college.
2014-10-02 21:02:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's not right.
2014-10-02 21:02:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Two years
2014-10-02 21:02:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sophomore and Junior year.
2014-10-02 21:03:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm surprised Miami apartments don't have them
2014-10-02 21:03:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some Miami apartments probably do
2014-10-02 21:04:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I guess I meant like they weren't normal enough for you to have one
2014-10-02 21:04:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they were really typical in Auburn
2014-10-02 21:12:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I dunno
2014-10-02 21:12:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I usually did my laundry at a friend's place junior and senior year 
2014-10-02 21:13:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I was doing it at my brother's place for the first half of my senior year then at Hannah's the second half
2014-10-02 21:13:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]big pain in the ass
2014-10-02 21:13:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was actually hauling my recycling to the city recycling area too
2014-10-02 21:13:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]back when I retained a bit of optimism
2014-10-02 21:13:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha

2014-10-02 21:22:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you really think you'll be that tired?

2014-10-02 21:30:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah? It stormed here today too.
2014-10-02 21:30:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just missed it so I didn't get rained on when I biked.
2014-10-02 21:30:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-10-02 21:30:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hopefully these days in the mid 90s are over
2014-10-02 21:31:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it does not make for a pleasant bike ride
2014-10-02 21:31:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]biking legit stresses me out
2014-10-02 21:31:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd be kinda fun if the roads weren't so shitty and I wasn't afraid I was gonna fall and get my head run over
2014-10-02 21:32:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I read about that happening to someone on the /r/chicago subreddit while I lived there
2014-10-02 21:32:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't tell me that!
2014-10-02 21:32:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha oh yeah
2014-10-02 21:32:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was probably a bad idea
2014-10-02 21:37:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]these deep networks are fucking rad man
2014-10-02 21:38:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]these are all images it hasn't seen before
2014-10-02 21:38:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this convolutional neural network
2014-10-02 21:39:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a coelogyne is an orchid
2014-10-02 21:40:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty awesome 
2014-10-02 21:41:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just thought to myself "I wonder what would happen if you through some video at these things"
2014-10-02 21:41:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Google it
2014-10-02 21:41:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2014 paper
2014-10-02 21:42:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from a Google Research and Stanford people
2014-10-02 21:43:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that should be threw by the way
2014-10-02 21:43:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what a funny error
2014-10-02 21:48:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Speech and image processing?
2014-10-02 21:48:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-10-02 21:49:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What study am I looking for?
2014-10-02 21:49:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're looking for the paper I just mentioned?
2014-10-02 21:50:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, you said to google it 
2014-10-02 21:50:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooooh
2014-10-02 21:50:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant I Googled it
2014-10-02 21:50:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's what I found
2014-10-02 21:50:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as in "a day late a dollar short" yet again
2014-10-02 21:50:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There will still be things to do once you get out of school 
2014-10-02 21:51:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah I know
2014-10-02 21:51:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is all really cutting-edge
2014-10-02 21:51:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just feel like I could've been part of it!
2014-10-02 21:52:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you'll be part of the next 'thing'
2014-10-02 21:52:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe!
2014-10-02 21:56:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we decided to go to this Absinthe show instead of the male revue show 
2014-10-02 21:57:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you bummed about that?
2014-10-02 21:57:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, the show does look pretty amazing 
2014-10-02 21:57:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright. Cool.
2014-10-02 21:57:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's just money after all
2014-10-02 21:58:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I was trying to tell ya!
2014-10-02 21:58:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I'll be able to convince anyone else to shell out $90 for dinner
2014-10-02 21:59:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I found a $35 on Monday that's at one of the new hotels and is supposed to be really good 
2014-10-02 21:59:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice.
2014-10-02 22:02:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was thinking about also making pudding shots for next weekend 
2014-10-02 22:02:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah?
2014-10-02 22:02:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you like pudding 
2014-10-02 22:03:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sure
2014-10-02 22:04:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you gonna try to get me drunk and sleep with you
2014-10-02 22:04:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I was not planning on that 
2014-10-02 22:05:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I assumed I didn't need to get you drunk for that 
2014-10-02 22:05:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no I guess you're right
2014-10-02 22:14:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The shots are pretty low alcohol per shot though 
2014-10-02 22:14:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So it'd take quite a few to get you drunk lol
2014-10-02 22:15:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word. It's whatever you want. I feel like these be more for your benefit than mine    😉 
2014-10-02 22:17:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just trying to think of something fun to do
2014-10-02 22:23:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Glad you seem to be in a better mood than this morning
2014-10-02 22:45:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright well I'm going to bed soon
2014-10-02 22:45:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]okey dokey
2014-10-02 22:49:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-10-02 22:50:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you!
2014-10-02 22:50:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So, so, so much
2014-10-02 22:50:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have a blast in Vegas
2014-10-02 22:52:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks, I'll call you when I have down time 
2014-10-02 22:52:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good
2014-10-02 22:52:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah!
2014-10-02 22:52:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-10-02 22:56:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send me lots of snaps 
2014-10-02 22:56:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'll try
2014-10-02 22:56:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not good at that, though
2014-10-02 22:56:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I'll try!
2014-10-02 22:56:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're talking about, you send great snaps 
2014-10-02 22:57:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Swooning all over again
2014-10-02 22:57:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha awww
2014-10-02 22:58:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you're OK with mirror imaged Michael
2014-10-02 22:59:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know how to flip
2014-10-02 23:00:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But now that you mention it, it does look weird 
2014-10-02 23:00:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha really?
2014-10-02 23:01:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's interesting.
2014-10-02 23:01:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure how much I can actually tell with you.
2014-10-02 23:01:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just tried to imagine kissing your face and it looked wrong 
2014-10-02 23:01:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha maaaan you're adorable
2014-10-02 23:02:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I guess you look different
2014-10-02 23:02:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we should test this someday
2014-10-02 23:03:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we need to take pics of you without your nose ring in, though
2014-10-02 23:03:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still have a little dot there, but yeah
2014-10-02 23:03:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have a mole on my face that is a give away too
2014-10-02 23:03:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'd be interesting 
2014-10-02 23:04:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know if I had the mole memorized though 
2014-10-02 23:04:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like if it was in the wrong place I'd probably know something was off, but could t tell you exactly what 
2014-10-02 23:05:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah that makes sense
2014-10-03 00:32:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can't sleep :/
2014-10-03 00:32:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh noooo
2014-10-03 00:32:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz you know you have to fall asleep?
2014-10-03 00:33:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably. And I drank coffee  at like 6p. Stupid. And now I'm paranoid there won't be a lyft/uber at 5:30a
2014-10-03 00:33:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm gonna wake up in time to take the bus if I have to
2014-10-03 00:34:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure there'll be a Lyft or Uber in Chicago at any time
2014-10-03 00:34:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess it's better to be safe than sorry
2014-10-03 00:34:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe in chicago. But not in south side/hyde park 
2014-10-03 00:35:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]True, but that's only like 10/15 minutes from downtown that early
2014-10-03 00:35:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's true 
2014-10-03 00:35:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why are you still awake?
2014-10-03 00:36:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]working on this lecture
2014-10-03 00:36:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and this Oregon vs. Arizona game is exciting
2014-10-03 00:36:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not too late for me yet
2014-10-03 00:36:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I usually go to sleep right around 12:30
2014-10-03 00:37:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Next Saturday can't come soon enough 
2014-10-03 00:38:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was thinking that's the other nice thing about a busy weekend- it'll make the time seem shorter  
2014-10-03 00:38:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Until I see you 
2014-10-03 00:38:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awww
2014-10-03 00:38:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you love me so much
2014-10-03 00:38:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-03 00:39:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes 
2014-10-03 00:39:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-10-03 00:39:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you might hate me at others
2014-10-03 00:39:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never ever felt hate towards you 
2014-10-03 00:39:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I believe that
2014-10-03 00:40:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I pretty much only ever feel love from you even when you're mad at me
2014-10-03 00:41:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha that might be a stretch 
2014-10-03 00:41:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm not saying you necessarily feel that way
2014-10-03 00:41:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't ever doubt that you love me
2014-10-03 00:42:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's good 
2014-10-03 00:42:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You shouldn't 
2014-10-03 00:44:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My mom said your smartness makes you good for me and my smartness
2014-10-03 00:45:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes our smartnesses lead to tension though lol
2014-10-03 00:45:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I guess it's been a little while 
2014-10-03 00:45:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]been a while since what?
2014-10-03 00:46:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since we had an overly heated debate on some topic
2014-10-03 00:46:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-10-03 00:46:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when was the last one?
2014-10-03 00:46:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe we've exhausted controversial topics
2014-10-03 00:47:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we've just taken a sabbatical to get overly heated about minute details in our relationship instead 
2014-10-03 00:48:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's been effective
2014-10-03 00:49:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dude
2014-10-03 00:49:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the Cowboys are doing well right now
2014-10-03 00:49:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]their offense is sick actually
2014-10-03 00:49:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think they might actually make the playoffs this year
2014-10-03 00:50:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Htown haters gotta hate though 
2014-10-03 00:50:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-10-03 00:50:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're not doing bad right now either
2014-10-03 00:51:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dude, collect some data I can build a convolutional neural network for 
2014-10-03 00:51:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm
2014-10-03 00:52:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can it detect loci under selection?
2014-10-03 00:52:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's probably not best for that
2014-10-03 00:52:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha
2014-10-03 00:53:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you just look for changes in frequencies right?
2014-10-03 00:53:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too many "has"
2014-10-03 00:53:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was a lot of has
2014-10-03 00:53:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not temporal changes
2014-10-03 00:53:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But between populations 
2014-10-03 00:54:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know how you would do that
2014-10-03 00:54:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is different frequencies not  valid in that case?
2014-10-03 00:55:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, if I gave a neural network the 100 bp seq at 10,000 loci for 300 individuals grouped into populations 
2014-10-03 00:55:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What would it do with that
2014-10-03 00:56:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you want it to do with that?
2014-10-03 00:56:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you didn't give it the 300 gropus
2014-10-03 00:56:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it could group them
2014-10-03 00:56:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you already know the groups
2014-10-03 00:57:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you sure it could group them?
2014-10-03 00:57:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably
2014-10-03 00:57:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless you think they aren't indicative
2014-10-03 00:57:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the loci
2014-10-03 00:57:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would still group them
2014-10-03 00:57:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they might not be accurate
2014-10-03 00:58:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like it would more likely group everything by homologous loci
2014-10-03 00:58:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like all 300 copies of a particular loci 
2014-10-03 00:59:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that wouldn't give any information basically
2014-10-03 00:59:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a homologous locus
2014-10-03 00:59:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it wouldn't do that
2014-10-03 00:59:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That would be a different way to do clustering and read mapping 
2014-10-03 00:59:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The only thing I'm worried about is the amount of data
2014-10-03 01:00:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be 300 * 100 * 10,000
2014-10-03 01:00:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh no
2014-10-03 01:00:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]its 100 * 10,000
2014-10-03 01:00:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are 300 data points
2014-10-03 01:00:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or wait
2014-10-03 01:00:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-03 01:00:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There are 100 base pairs in a sequence 
2014-10-03 01:00:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's just a string 
2014-10-03 01:01:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I know
2014-10-03 01:01:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but there are 10,000 of them
2014-10-03 01:01:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]300 * 10000 
2014-10-03 01:01:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so there are 1,000,000 inputs
2014-10-03 01:01:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-03 01:01:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'd have 300 samples
2014-10-03 01:01:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but each input size is 1,000,000
2014-10-03 01:01:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why are you counting each bp as an input?
2014-10-03 01:02:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you don't have to do it that way
2014-10-03 01:02:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well
2014-10-03 01:02:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm actually not sure
2014-10-03 01:02:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have access to the UChicago cluster 
2014-10-03 01:02:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-10-03 01:03:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well not right this second 
2014-10-03 01:03:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I can sign up when I want it
2014-10-03 01:03:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-10-03 01:03:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's why I said it'd have to be that way
2014-10-03 01:04:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you need numerical inputs
2014-10-03 01:04:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it's doing these weight linear mulitplications
2014-10-03 01:04:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it applies functions to them at each hidden layer
2014-10-03 01:04:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmmm
2014-10-03 01:05:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]actually, I just read a natural language processing paper where they used convolutional neural networks
2014-10-03 01:05:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so there must be a way to feed strings in
2014-10-03 01:05:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless
2014-10-03 01:05:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they have an input for each possible word
2014-10-03 01:05:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they assign it a 1 if its present and a 0 if its not
2014-10-03 01:05:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's * 2
2014-10-03 01:06:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so there are 10,000 loci
2014-10-03 01:07:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ehh I don't know
2014-10-03 01:07:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'd have to think of a way to numerically represent each locus
2014-10-03 01:08:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you'd have to do that by using some clustering algorithm probably
2014-10-03 01:08:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It sounds like this is not the right tool for my data lol
2014-10-03 01:08:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-03 01:08:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you want the bioinformatics algorithms
2014-10-03 01:09:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]string mismatches and such
2014-10-03 01:09:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now
2014-10-03 01:09:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you had a bunch of ecological data
2014-10-03 01:09:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and wanted to predict something
2014-10-03 01:09:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like reproductive success
2014-10-03 01:09:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that might be interesting
2014-10-03 01:09:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that would actually be really interesting
2014-10-03 01:10:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because these deep nets pick up "low-level" and "high-level" features
2014-10-03 01:10:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so for images
2014-10-03 01:10:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they pick up things like edges
2014-10-03 01:10:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as low-level features
2014-10-03 01:10:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and at higher levels things get more complex and complete
2014-10-03 01:10:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it'd be interesting to know what "low-level" and "high-level" features you could learn from ecological data
2014-10-03 01:11:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that might be a Nature paper honestly
2014-10-03 01:11:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You could reanalyze some classic data sets 
2014-10-03 01:11:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like the turtle one!
2014-10-03 01:11:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's the turtle one?
2014-10-03 01:14:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't find the paper right now. But basically they took a bunch of data for different life stages put them into some population demographic models and showed that increasing the survival of the offspring actually had little effect on the overall reproductive success of the population 
2014-10-03 01:14:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The sensitive life's rage wS juveniles 
2014-10-03 01:14:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*stage 
2014-10-03 01:15:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-10-03 01:15:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now that I'm actually thinking about it
2014-10-03 01:15:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there wouldn't be any local structure to the data
2014-10-03 01:15:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is what convolutional nets are good at detecting
2014-10-03 01:15:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a deep net would still be interesting to see if was good at predicting things
2014-10-03 01:16:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](it probably would be)
2014-10-03 01:16:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you mean, no local structure?
2014-10-03 01:16:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you wouldn't be getting the abstractions
2014-10-03 01:16:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so in images
2014-10-03 01:16:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there is local structure
2014-10-03 01:16:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in the picture
2014-10-03 01:16:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]adjacent pixels are correlated
2014-10-03 01:16:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and in music
2014-10-03 01:16:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]adjacent seconds are correlated
2014-10-03 01:16:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's why it picks up on edges in images
2014-10-03 01:16:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or harmonies in music
2014-10-03 01:17:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aren't all the individuals in a small closes population correlated 
2014-10-03 01:17:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or some factor of their biology?
2014-10-03 01:18:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but what would be the local structure
2014-10-03 01:18:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in that dataset
2014-10-03 01:18:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the way you feed neural nets
2014-10-03 01:18:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is you provide a vector of numbers
2014-10-03 01:19:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or a matrix I guess
2014-10-03 01:19:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so a matrix in an image is gonna have local structure
2014-10-03 01:19:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and in a spectrogram of music
2014-10-03 01:19:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the variables won't be related to adjacent variables
2014-10-03 01:19:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in any structural way
2014-10-03 01:19:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can talk about this another night 
2014-10-03 01:20:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-10-03 01:20:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's a lot of matrix stuff in ecology 
2014-10-03 01:20:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get that.
2014-10-03 01:20:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Esp population ecology 
2014-10-03 01:20:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think you're understanding what I'm saying.
2014-10-03 01:20:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not the matrix that is important
2014-10-03 01:21:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's the fact that a blue pixel is probably gonna be next to another blue pixel
2014-10-03 01:22:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm becoming less impressed with the possible applications of these networks 
2014-10-03 01:22:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they are meant to recognize abstract objects
2014-10-03 01:23:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or abstractions in general
2014-10-03 01:23:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]regressions are easy
2014-10-03 01:23:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we've been doing it forever
2014-10-03 01:23:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]recognizing music or objects in an image is very abstract
2014-10-03 01:24:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So can it recognize abstract patterns or correlations in a dataset?
2014-10-03 01:24:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not abstract
2014-10-03 01:24:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at all
2014-10-03 01:24:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]saying a collecting of pixels is a horse is an abstraction
2014-10-03 01:24:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I meant correlations we can't detect with our current statistical methods 
2014-10-03 01:24:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*collection
2014-10-03 01:25:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-10-03 01:25:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you fed a neural net a bunch of data
2014-10-03 01:25:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like that turtle data
2014-10-03 01:25:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would make accurate predictions
2014-10-03 01:25:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the hidden layers would be finding correlations
2014-10-03 01:39:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]actually there would be locality in genes
2014-10-03 01:39:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it might pick up on genes affecting each other
2014-10-03 01:39:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still don't know how to represent that data, though
2014-10-03 01:39:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for NLP stuff
2014-10-03 01:40:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it looks like they have a matrix of weights for each word in a possible dictionary
2014-10-03 01:40:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know what the equivalent of that would be for genes
2014-10-03 01:42:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you could just number genes by their order on a chromosome 
2014-10-03 01:42:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for the input
2014-10-03 01:43:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could count the number of nucleotides
2014-10-03 01:43:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for each gene
2014-10-03 01:43:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and order it like that
2014-10-03 01:43:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so Gene1: #As, #Cs, #Gs, #Ts
2014-10-03 01:43:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the vector would be like
2014-10-03 01:43:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1,9,15,20,24,15,2,10
2014-10-03 01:44:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that doesn't work
2014-10-03 01:44:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because you don't have mismatches
2014-10-03 01:44:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It wouldn't work for population stuff
2014-10-03 01:45:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But maybe in like detecting transcription factor binding sites.  
2014-10-03 01:45:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or detecting conserved motifs in a species 
2014-10-03 01:46:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like you don't tell it what a binding site is, but it finds this 4 bp motif is always 1 kb away from a conserved coding sequence
2014-10-03 01:48:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-03 01:48:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-10-03 01:48:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could do a 300 * 100 * 10,000 matrix
2014-10-03 01:48:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and for each sample
2014-10-03 01:48:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have it's distance away from each other sample
2014-10-03 01:49:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for each nucleotide
2014-10-03 01:49:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so if they're the same
2014-10-03 01:49:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd be a 0
2014-10-03 01:49:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and if it's a purine to pyrimidine a 1
2014-10-03 01:49:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or whatever those rules are
2014-10-03 01:49:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that would be a shit ton of data
2014-10-03 01:49:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'd have 300 of those matrix volumes
2014-10-03 01:50:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it wouldn't be a volume
2014-10-03 01:50:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd be 2D
2014-10-03 01:50:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]300 x (100 * 10,000)
2014-10-03 01:50:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still
2014-10-03 01:50:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a lot of data
2014-10-03 01:51:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We'll figure out a way to collaborate some day haha
2014-10-03 01:53:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol ok
2014-10-03 01:53:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I appreciate the serious thought you put into my proposal though 
2014-10-03 01:53:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna crash 
2014-10-03 01:54:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hopefully 
2014-10-03 01:54:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-03 01:54:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should too!
2014-10-03 01:54:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hope so too.
2014-10-03 06:16:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're offering $300 credit to get there 3 hours later
2014-10-03 06:16:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sooo tempting 
2014-10-03 06:27:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then they bumped it to $450.......
2014-10-03 08:31:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You did it right?!
2014-10-03 10:33:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was actually getting there 5 hours later 
2014-10-03 10:33:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I didn't want to wait around the airport that long and couldn't do that to Haley 
2014-10-03 10:33:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's a little long
2014-10-03 10:34:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Her flight left at 5:15 (connecting in Phoenix) so I couldn't talk to her about it
2014-10-03 10:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]holy shit that's early
2014-10-03 10:35:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Plus, I've officially spent $2000 on my card, so I have 50,000 miles (~4 round trip Dallas flights) coming in a few weeks 
2014-10-03 10:35:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't really need that credit 
2014-10-03 10:35:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wow awesome!
2014-10-03 10:35:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My last Dallas flight was 10,000 points 
2014-10-03 10:36:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that's BC I picked early weird times 
2014-10-03 10:36:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so maybe more like ~3 roundtrips?
2014-10-03 10:37:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I also have like 3000 points just from my spending so far 
2014-10-03 10:37:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright sweet
2014-10-03 10:37:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yeah, either way I'm not going to be paying for a flight for a while 
2014-10-03 10:37:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If it was $400 cash, no question 
2014-10-03 10:37:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word, that's what I thought you meant at first
2014-10-03 10:38:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should only really have to use a couple of those roundtrips on me
2014-10-03 10:38:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm hoping for ~5 visits next semester
2014-10-03 10:38:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then we won't need to fly to each other anymore    😃 
2014-10-03 10:39:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!
2014-10-03 10:39:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-10-03 10:40:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too!
2014-10-03 10:46:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This new iOS saps my battery for some reason 
2014-10-03 10:46:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I've heard that being an issue
2014-10-03 10:47:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have a 4S right?
2014-10-03 10:47:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-10-03 10:47:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can probably upgrade at some point yeah?
2014-10-03 10:47:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could now, since my mom got the 6
2014-10-03 10:47:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can take her 5
2014-10-03 10:48:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright haha
2014-10-03 10:48:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But Daniel has a 3
2014-10-03 10:48:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ouch
2014-10-03 10:48:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm surprised it even works
2014-10-03 10:48:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He hasn't updated in a long time 
2014-10-03 10:49:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably a good decision
2014-10-03 10:51:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you just hanging out at the airport until Haley gets there?
2014-10-03 10:51:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm getting my bag 
2014-10-03 10:51:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh alright
2014-10-03 10:51:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Her flight should land in 10 min
2014-10-03 10:51:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-10-03 10:51:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Flying over the Rockies and desert was pretty awesome 
2014-10-03 10:52:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least the parts where I was conscious lol
2014-10-03 10:52:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I bet.
2014-10-03 10:52:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you played any slots yet?
2014-10-03 10:54:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha noo
2014-10-03 10:54:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm staying away from gambling 
2014-10-03 10:55:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You gotta play SOMETHING.
2014-10-03 10:55:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I will I will 
2014-10-03 10:55:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha good.
2014-10-03 10:55:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Might go to the hotel casino with $40 
2014-10-03 12:27:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I ate too much before I thought to take a snap
2014-10-03 12:28:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yummy!
2014-10-03 12:28:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's the thing in the glass?
2014-10-03 12:28:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to the right of the dip

2014-10-04 10:52:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We got to dance behind the DJ booth at a table with another girl there for her bday
2014-10-04 10:53:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And get free drinks 
2014-10-04 10:53:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The music was fun too

2014-10-04 10:57:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did not hydrate enough yesterday though
2014-10-04 10:57:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We literally drank from 9a to 2a
2014-10-04 10:58:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a lot of alcohol
2014-10-04 11:15:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My phone is being swept
2014-10-04 11:15:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*derpt
2014-10-04 11:15:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how so?
2014-10-04 11:16:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Typing is really slow 
2014-10-04 11:16:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the 4g isn't working well
2014-10-04 11:16:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bummer

2014-10-04 19:41:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Leaving the Steve Aoki pool party now 
2014-10-04 19:42:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh it's a day thing?
2014-10-04 19:43:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah we got there at noon
2014-10-04 19:43:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-10-04 19:43:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am a much tanner person 
2014-10-04 19:43:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was it?
2014-10-04 19:43:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was pretty fucking awesomw 
2014-10-04 19:43:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*awesome 
2014-10-04 19:44:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We paid like $120 each for essentially all you can drink/eat
2014-10-04 19:44:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice.
2014-10-04 19:44:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it was worth it 
2014-10-04 19:45:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We are definitely going to Vegas together sometime soon 
2014-10-04 19:46:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to grind up on you in a pool 
2014-10-04 19:48:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha sounds good.
2014-10-04 19:50:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are you doing tonight?
2014-10-04 19:55:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The other girls are seeing a show, but I think Haley and I are gonna watch tv until midnight and relax 
2014-10-04 19:56:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And maybe go to a club after
2014-10-04 19:56:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's the show they're going to?
2014-10-04 19:56:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I
2014-10-04 19:56:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*O
2014-10-04 19:57:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cirque show 
2014-10-04 19:57:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh nice.
2014-10-04 19:57:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's the pool one at the Bellagio?
2014-10-04 19:58:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Umm maybe 
2014-10-04 19:58:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know much about it
2014-10-04 20:01:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you been watching football?
2014-10-04 20:03:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-04 20:04:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Looks like auburn is destroying lsu
2014-10-04 20:04:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-04 20:04:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still a whole half to play
2014-10-04 20:04:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]our offense has looked good, though
2014-10-04 20:04:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and their QB is terrible
2014-10-04 20:06:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-10-04 21:26:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mom asked if you were secretly here and we were getting married
2014-10-04 21:27:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha not this time
2014-10-04 21:28:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't put it outside the realm of possibilities if we go to Vegas together, though
2014-10-04 21:31:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha true, but she doesn't need to know that yet  
2014-10-04 21:31:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]know that we're that serious?
2014-10-04 21:32:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess she obviously suspects it already 
2014-10-04 21:32:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah
2014-10-04 21:34:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what club you think you're going to tonight?
2014-10-04 21:35:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe hakkasan 
2014-10-04 21:35:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The other girls have some friends in town we might meet up with 
2014-10-04 21:36:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-10-04 21:36:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Miami fucking sucks 
2014-10-04 21:36:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so funny how girls and guys tickets are different prices
2014-10-04 21:37:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's pretty unfair 
2014-10-04 21:37:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not really
2014-10-04 21:37:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess some states are outlawing it
2014-10-04 21:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-10-04 21:38:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it makes sense from an economics point-of-view
2014-10-04 21:38:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-10-04 21:38:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm OK with it
2014-10-04 21:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]especially if it keeps the ratio more in the guys favor
2014-10-04 21:39:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]than it would be otherwise
2014-10-04 21:41:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-10-04 21:41:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess if you're gay it's not ideal
2014-10-04 21:42:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I suppose so
2014-10-04 21:42:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A gay male 
2014-10-04 21:42:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I imagine these clubs have less appeal to gay dudes
2014-10-04 21:42:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they probably got their own awesome gay clubs to go to
2014-10-04 21:44:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-10-04 21:44:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We got dominos for dinner 
2014-10-04 21:44:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love dominos so much 
2014-10-04 21:45:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Almost as much as I love you  😘😘😘😘😘
2014-10-04 21:45:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-04 21:45:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was the pool thing today topless?
2014-10-04 21:46:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No 
2014-10-04 21:46:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like that would be a good idea
2014-10-04 21:46:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The topless pool didn't even have that many topless women 
2014-10-04 21:47:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like 20% women there were too less
2014-10-04 21:47:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*topless
2014-10-04 21:47:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just saying
2014-10-04 21:47:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at like a club like atmosphere
2014-10-04 21:47:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pool
2014-10-04 21:47:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why not let some titties out
2014-10-04 21:47:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that could be sexy
2014-10-04 21:47:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure 
2014-10-04 21:48:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is still America though 
2014-10-04 21:48:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's Las Vegas
2014-10-04 21:48:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the whole point is to get fucked up and fuck people
2014-10-04 21:48:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what it was built for
2014-10-04 21:49:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I should start one
2014-10-04 21:50:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know if that many women are into it 
2014-10-04 21:50:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Based on the low participation at the actual topless pool
2014-10-04 21:50:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-04 21:50:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess
2014-10-04 21:50:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but what if some drunk girls see some other drunk girls having a really good time
2014-10-04 21:51:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]rubbing their titties on some dude
2014-10-04 21:51:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd be worth a shot
2014-10-04 21:51:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just allow it I guess
2014-10-04 21:51:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If that's not their thing, they'd probably just judge the girls 
2014-10-04 21:51:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and see what happens
2014-10-04 21:51:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you think so?
2014-10-04 21:51:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's fucking Las Vegas
2014-10-04 21:51:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who has the right to judge?
2014-10-04 21:52:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just saying how it is
2014-10-04 21:53:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's too bad
2014-10-04 21:53:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's so much more titillation to be had.
2014-10-04 21:53:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd only judge the girls based on the quality of their breasts.
2014-10-04 21:53:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because that's just the stand up kind of guy I am
2014-10-04 21:54:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]....
2014-10-04 21:59:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't even know why I talk to you 
2014-10-04 22:00:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-10-04 22:00:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your bitterness (or whatever it is) is overwhelming 
2014-10-04 22:01:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-10-04 22:01:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I said I'd judge girls by the quality of their titties?
2014-10-04 22:02:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeesh
2014-10-04 22:02:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whatever
2014-10-04 22:05:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you clarify?
2014-10-04 22:07:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-10-04 22:07:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for real
2014-10-04 22:07:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]clarify
2014-10-04 22:08:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My phone died
2014-10-04 22:08:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't think your joke was funny 
2014-10-04 22:09:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Every time this topic has come up, your attitude about it is harsh and kind of poisonous 
2014-10-04 22:09:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what topic?
2014-10-04 22:09:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even know what you're talking about
2014-10-04 22:10:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I didn't feel bitter
2014-10-04 22:10:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I feel pretty fucking bitter now
2014-10-04 22:10:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so congrats
2014-10-04 22:11:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why do you even date me if I'm "so bitter"
2014-10-04 22:15:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man, I'm so fucking stressed now!
2014-10-04 22:15:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why did you do that?
2014-10-04 22:15:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then you just disappear
2014-10-04 22:15:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's so inconsiderate
2014-10-04 22:17:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK well I want you to know you've made me pretty upset
2014-10-04 22:52:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The topic of toplessness at a club, and whether I participate in it or not 
2014-10-04 22:53:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And indirect judgements on the type of women who do go topless
2014-10-04 23:28:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna lose you one day because I'm crazy and paranoid 
2014-10-04 23:29:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not usually like this in a relationship 
2014-10-04 23:30:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hope that doesn't happen.
2014-10-04 23:30:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it will.
2014-10-04 23:31:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when you say things like "why do I even talk to you"
2014-10-04 23:31:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and say I'm bitter
2014-10-04 23:31:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it makes ME crazy and paranoid
2014-10-04 23:31:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was really upset when that just happened
2014-10-04 23:31:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had to stop what I was doing and just lie down on the bed for a bit
2014-10-04 23:34:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know what's fucking wrong with me. Even though you were making me frustrated, it was nearly bad enough to merit me making you feel that way
2014-10-04 23:37:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just a very valid reason for you to not want to be with me
2014-10-04 23:37:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I take things like that very seriously
2014-10-04 23:37:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I know it's a flaw of mine
2014-10-04 23:38:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Taking things like that too seriously?
2014-10-04 23:38:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-04 23:38:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]having a tendency to be negative at times
2014-10-04 23:40:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need to not take your negativity so personal though 
2014-10-04 23:41:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're observation is totally right, I'm self conscious or have a complex about some of the "wilder" things I do 
2014-10-04 23:41:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And more prone to be overly sensitive about them 
2014-10-04 23:43:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I guess it's a bad combo then
2014-10-04 23:43:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's something we can work on 
2014-10-04 23:44:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right?
2014-10-04 23:44:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I guess so
2014-10-04 23:49:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't give up on us
2014-10-04 23:51:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gotta at least make it to close-distance haha
2014-10-04 23:51:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right
2014-10-05 01:47:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not making it out to the club 
2014-10-05 21:03:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-10-05 21:04:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too.
2014-10-05 21:18:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But seriously, I'm gonna marry you and spend the rest of my life wth you

2014-10-06 12:10:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But wisely decided not too 
2014-10-06 12:11:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm definitely bringing some kind of stimulant next time I come though 
2014-10-06 12:11:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah?
2014-10-06 12:12:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a struggle to keep going at times 
2014-10-06 12:12:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-06 12:13:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate alcohol 
2014-10-06 12:13:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would you fly with cocaine?

2014-10-06 12:16:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Rolling at the pool party would've been pretty fun

2014-10-06 12:17:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She has

2014-10-06 12:23:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I don't think her friends would've been down 
2014-10-06 12:24:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess they wouldn't have had to have known, but oh well
2014-10-06 12:24:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]next time
2014-10-06 12:24:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]should we do some drugs while I visit?

2014-10-06 15:17:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's closing day for this pool, so locals get open bar
2014-10-06 15:19:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And so there are a lot more locals here 
2014-10-06 15:20:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Both guys were rolling, so obviously pretty friendly 
2014-10-06 15:20:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-10-06 15:20:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean by open bar?

2014-10-06 19:57:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah?
2014-10-06 19:57:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how so?
2014-10-06 19:58:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some guy Haley was talking to sucked on her nipples lol
2014-10-06 19:58:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is this the topless pool?
2014-10-06 19:58:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah

2014-10-06 19:58:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't even go topless today 
2014-10-06 19:58:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bc I was wearing a 1 piece 
2014-10-06 19:59:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the pool is down with people sucking on titties?
2014-10-06 19:59:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I guess. 
2014-10-06 19:59:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas I guess
2014-10-06 20:00:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are people just like making out at this pool?
2014-10-06 20:00:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and getting frisky?
2014-10-06 20:01:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not on previous days 
2014-10-06 20:01:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But they were trying to make this one rowdy 
2014-10-06 20:01:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They handed out water guns 
2014-10-06 20:01:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who was?
2014-10-06 20:01:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh the pool people?
2014-10-06 20:02:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-10-06 20:02:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-10-06 20:02:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could get laid so much as a Las Vegas local
2014-10-06 20:02:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably 
2014-10-06 20:03:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is Sergey one of your new pool friends?
2014-10-06 20:03:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Compared to Miami, the vibe in Vegas was generally less creepy and aggressively trying to hook up
2014-10-06 20:03:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder why that is.
2014-10-06 20:03:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kinda think it has too do with demographics
2014-10-06 20:04:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't get me wrong, there was still a lot of benefits for women 
2014-10-06 20:04:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But as far as dancing, none of us were grabbed or danced up on unless we initiated it 
2014-10-06 20:05:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you dance up on some dudes?
2014-10-06 20:05:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-10-06 20:05:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I swung danced with one guy
2014-10-06 20:06:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Actually, I guess Haley was hit on pretty aggressively by a couple of lesbians at a gay bar 
2014-10-06 20:07:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like she did Vegas right
2014-10-06 20:07:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah Sergei is a pool friend 
2014-10-06 20:07:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you planning on seeing him again?
2014-10-06 20:07:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One of the ones with Molly hook up
2014-10-06 20:07:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess if I got back to Vegas 
2014-10-06 20:07:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah?
2014-10-06 20:07:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A drug hookup could be valuable 
2014-10-06 20:09:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Vegas lived up to the hype?
2014-10-06 20:10:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm a fan 
2014-10-06 20:10:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish I had friends to go to Vegas with
2014-10-06 20:10:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hate my life
2014-10-06 20:10:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-10-06 20:10:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm beat though 
2014-10-06 20:10:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh
2014-10-06 20:15:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we can try to come together next October 
2014-10-06 20:16:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's more the friends part that depresses me
2014-10-06 20:17:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I can't help you there 
2014-10-06 20:17:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no shit
2014-10-06 20:18:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sorry
2014-10-06 20:19:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-10-06 20:19:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even when you're a crabby patty 
2014-10-06 20:20:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's more depressed.
2014-10-06 20:20:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just feel really sad all the time.
2014-10-06 20:20:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And here I am thinking that I was making you really happy 
2014-10-06 20:21:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really?
2014-10-06 20:21:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is that a joke?
2014-10-06 20:22:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-06 20:22:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like our relationship hasn't been bringing me much happiness the past couple of weeks
2014-10-06 20:22:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not your fault
2014-10-06 20:22:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just am in a really shitty situation socially
2014-10-06 20:22:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we are very incompatible
2014-10-06 20:23:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for long-distance
2014-10-06 20:23:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd rather not have this conversation over text right before I get on a 4 hr plane ride 
2014-10-06 20:24:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-06 20:24:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's not really a conversation to be had
2014-10-06 20:24:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you want to break up with me, I'd prefer you to do it in person 
2014-10-06 20:24:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not saying anything new
2014-10-06 20:24:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not breaking up with you
2014-10-06 20:24:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Jesus
2014-10-06 20:24:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you
2014-10-06 20:24:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK?
2014-10-06 20:24:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not going to ever break up with you.
2014-10-06 20:24:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm explaining why I'm donw.
2014-10-06 20:25:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're just going to be miserable 75% of the time for the next 7 months?
2014-10-06 20:25:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hopefully not
2014-10-06 20:25:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're gonna see each other a lot for the next few months
2014-10-06 20:26:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then maybe I'll try to travel some in the spring or something to keep me from getting in these funks
2014-10-06 20:26:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]visit Justin or my family or something
2014-10-06 20:29:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We've seen each other more the past 2 months than we will the next 2
2014-10-06 20:29:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like # of days?
2014-10-06 20:30:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-10-06 20:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not really the # of days we see each other that are the problem
2014-10-06 20:31:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's the gaps
2014-10-06 20:31:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I had friends, this would be a lot easier
2014-10-06 20:31:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for me
2014-10-06 20:32:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna go out with Dar tomorrow night I think
2014-10-06 20:32:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fun 
2014-10-06 20:33:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just wish I could be enough to make you happier instead of making you feel worse by comparison 
2014-10-06 20:34:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like if I just lived near Justin
2014-10-06 20:34:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or Zack and Jacob
2014-10-06 20:34:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess there's only so much I can do
2014-10-06 20:34:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or in Chicago
2014-10-06 20:34:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd be fine
2014-10-06 20:35:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if fI just had some people to hangout with a couple to a few times a week
2014-10-06 20:38:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K I'm boarding 
2014-10-06 20:38:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Talk to you later

2014-10-07 01:24:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Turning on my computer
2014-10-07 01:30:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where is ya?
2014-10-07 12:05:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was freaky
2014-10-07 12:05:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-10-07 12:05:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't brush my teeth after taking pepto, and I woke up with a pitch black mouth 
2014-10-07 12:05:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whaaaat
2014-10-07 12:05:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you take a picture?
2014-10-07 12:06:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha no, I should've though 
2014-10-07 12:06:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My teeth looked like they were gonna fall asleep 
2014-10-07 12:06:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Google Images has some results
2014-10-07 12:06:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fall asleep?
2014-10-07 12:07:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]all they are showing are tongues, though
2014-10-07 12:07:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh that's because it auto completed to black tongue
2014-10-07 12:07:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*fall out 
2014-10-07 12:07:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that would freak me out!
2014-10-07 12:08:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you got sulfur in yo saliva
2014-10-07 12:08:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-10-07 12:09:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wrote a script to download 25,000 images from this website that has a bunch of pictures of paintings
2014-10-07 12:09:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-07 12:09:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's gonna run for like 20 hours
2014-10-07 12:10:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice 
2014-10-07 12:14:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's gonna cause a lot of traffic on their website, but I sent them an email asking for a bulk download and no one responded.
2014-10-07 12:16:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you'll boost their advertising score 
2014-10-07 12:18:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think they have advertisements. It's supposed to be an educational website I think.
2014-10-07 12:19:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might name the network ARTificial Intelligence if it works
2014-10-07 12:21:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Clever 
2014-10-07 12:21:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wouldn't be very searchable, though
2014-10-07 16:41:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My girlfriend just texted me "thespacebuttonisbrokenonmyphonecanyoupleasegivemeanalternative"
2014-10-07 16:41:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Does anyone know what "ternative" means?
2014-10-07 16:42:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-10-07 16:42:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I get it 
2014-10-07 16:42:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-10-07 16:42:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Reddit joke?
2014-10-07 16:42:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You know it!
2014-10-07 16:43:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-10-07 16:43:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm waiting at a ups pickup location 
2014-10-07 16:43:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For what?
2014-10-07 16:44:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They didn't drop something off because my name wasn't in the building directory 
2014-10-07 16:44:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yet, they put the notice in my mailbox...
2014-10-07 16:44:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's something my mom sent me
2014-10-07 16:44:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How do you get your name in the directory?
2014-10-07 16:45:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On the buzzer it still says Ross/Palmer 
2014-10-07 16:45:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it says my name on the mailbox 
2014-10-07 16:46:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obnoxious 
2014-10-07 16:47:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can you ask your landlord to change that?
2014-10-07 16:47:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did a while ago, I'll remind him 
2014-10-07 16:50:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I got shafted on my algorithms quiz grade. It says "incorrect algorithm", but it's almost identical to the algorithm as presented on Wikipedia.
2014-10-07 17:52:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was told it was wrong because "it wasn't the one we learned in class"
2014-10-07 17:52:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whoops
2014-10-07 21:48:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ah I figured it would be something like that
2014-10-07 21:48:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just got back from band
2014-10-07 21:48:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it ends at 9:30?
2014-10-07 21:48:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had in my head it started at 9:30
2014-10-07 21:50:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's 7p to 9:30p
2014-10-07 21:50:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that would be pretty insane to start at 9:30
2014-10-07 21:50:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]intramural stuff can start pretty late
2014-10-07 21:51:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's a basketball league here that plays games at 11 PM
2014-10-07 21:51:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but how'd it go?
2014-10-07 21:51:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]good
2014-10-07 21:51:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm out of shape
2014-10-07 21:51:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]as far as lip strength
2014-10-07 21:51:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tender?
2014-10-07 21:52:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I like most of the pieces and I like the director
2014-10-07 21:52:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]they will be tomorrow
2014-10-07 21:52:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's cool
2014-10-07 21:52:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you make friends with some band people?
2014-10-07 21:53:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I talked to the tuba and euphonium players on either side
2014-10-07 21:53:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]friendly little 18 year old band dorks
2014-10-07 21:54:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-10-07 21:54:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I get to play on one piece all by myself
2014-10-07 21:54:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]as in no other tuba players
2014-10-07 21:54:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet!
2014-10-07 21:54:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why's that?
2014-10-07 21:59:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]cause I'm da best
2014-10-07 21:59:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lol
2014-10-07 21:59:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]because it's a french horn solo concerto and so a smaller ensemble plays with her
2014-10-07 22:03:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how was your day?
2014-10-07 22:06:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]eh OK
2014-10-07 22:06:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that quiz kinda pissed me off
2014-10-07 22:07:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Carl just paid me for the tickets to the TCU vs. Kansas State game we're going to
2014-10-07 22:08:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sweet
2014-10-07 22:08:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how much were they?
2014-10-07 22:09:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$31.80, but because it's my birthday month I got free e-delivery on StubHub
2014-10-07 22:09:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so like $27.50 I think
2014-10-07 22:09:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]wooo
2014-10-07 22:09:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we went to dennys the other day for breakfast
2014-10-07 22:09:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and bc it was haleys bday she got a free grand slam
2014-10-07 22:09:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh yeah!
2014-10-07 22:09:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty sure my mom's all about that
2014-10-07 22:10:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so are you really the only tuba player because you're the best?
2014-10-07 22:11:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess
2014-10-07 22:12:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you got that tuba swag
2014-10-07 22:12:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]someone didn't show up to rehearsal who's a tuba teacher in the suburbs
2014-10-07 22:12:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and so I played that piece and the director said even if that dude does start coming I can stay on it
2014-10-07 22:12:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm thinking they haven't had very good tuba players the past few years
2014-10-07 22:13:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why's that?
2014-10-07 22:14:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]because they obviously had to have a non-uchicago tuba player come play
2014-10-07 22:14:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and the other tuba players are freshman
2014-10-07 22:14:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh I see
2014-10-07 22:14:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that makes sense

2014-10-07 23:10:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't slept awesome the past couple of nights and I've been ok
2014-10-07 23:14:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why haven't you slept well?
2014-10-07 23:15:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just feeling bad

2014-10-07 23:16:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's OK
2014-10-07 23:16:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I realized today that I was actually getting used to just being by myself last year
2014-10-07 23:16:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]before I met you
2014-10-07 23:17:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or before we started dating I should say
2014-10-07 23:17:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I think I got away from doing the things that were giving me happiness
2014-10-07 23:17:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like watching movies and listening to music and reading books
2014-10-07 23:17:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm gonna try to get back into that stuff
2014-10-07 23:18:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well I feel like you still do some of that stuff
2014-10-07 23:18:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but maybe not at the same frequency?
2014-10-07 23:19:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-07 23:19:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and not with like a purpose I guess
2014-10-07 23:19:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like it was something I was actively doing last year
2014-10-07 23:20:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I see
2014-10-07 23:21:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you just reminded me how much I like being around people having a good time and I want it all the time
2014-10-07 23:21:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]especially being around you
2014-10-07 23:21:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're so much fun
2014-10-07 23:21:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and full of life

2014-10-07 23:21:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's addicting
2014-10-07 23:22:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I prefer this attitude to the one where I tell you about my life and you respond that you hate yours lol
2014-10-07 23:23:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I know
2014-10-07 23:23:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not ever trying to make you feel bad
2014-10-07 23:23:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's more just stream of conscious that I should keep to myself
2014-10-07 23:23:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or really get over
2014-10-07 23:23:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is what I'm trying to do with this movies/books/music thing
2014-10-07 23:24:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]then I support it %100
2014-10-07 23:24:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I always fuck up my % signs
2014-10-07 23:24:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-07 23:24:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it should go in front!

2014-10-07 23:24:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha hmm
2014-10-07 23:25:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe the dollar sign should go at the back?

2014-10-07 23:25:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha

2014-10-07 23:25:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm going through it faster than Lolita I think
2014-10-07 23:26:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you could probably tear through it
2014-10-07 23:26:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]which book are you starting with?

2014-10-07 23:32:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why's that
2014-10-07 23:33:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]she forgets to bring it to school a lot and doesn't check it very often
2014-10-07 23:33:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's so not 21st century
2014-10-07 23:33:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha definitely not
2014-10-07 23:35:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight, beautiful
2014-10-07 23:35:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you
2014-10-07 23:35:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah!
2014-10-08 01:28:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Come cuddle me 
2014-10-08 01:28:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*pout*
2014-10-08 09:16:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw. Couldn't fall asleep?
2014-10-08 09:21:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-10-08 09:22:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I overslept yesterday 
2014-10-08 09:22:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how late did you sleep?
2014-10-08 09:23:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like noon
2014-10-08 09:23:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah that might've had something to do with it
2014-10-08 09:24:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I was antsy about you being here 
2014-10-08 09:24:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I always get terrible sleep right before I see you
2014-10-08 09:25:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw. That sucks, but it's pretty adorable too.
2014-10-08 09:28:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got approved for that Quicksilver card
2014-10-08 09:28:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just waiting to get it in the mail
2014-10-08 09:28:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice 
2014-10-08 09:28:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What are the benefits/rewards again?
2014-10-08 09:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no annual fee
2014-10-08 09:29:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1.5% cashback on everything
2014-10-08 09:29:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah 
2014-10-08 09:29:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And an actual credit card 
2014-10-08 09:30:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so even if I don't use it much I'll be getting more "money" back than I was with my AmEx
2014-10-08 09:30:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-08 09:30:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$5 k limit
2014-10-08 09:30:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wooo
2014-10-08 09:30:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Between our cards, we can buy something for 13k!
2014-10-08 09:30:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha we're rich!
2014-10-08 09:33:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't forget to check in to your flight Friday morning 
2014-10-08 09:33:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or you'll get stuck with a middle seat between 2 crying babies 
2014-10-08 09:34:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-10-08 09:34:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did that happen to you?
2014-10-08 09:37:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Megabus for thanksgiving is showing up!
2014-10-08 09:37:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweeeet
2014-10-08 09:37:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still cheap tickets?
2014-10-08 09:37:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]From $1
2014-10-08 09:37:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hell yes
2014-10-08 09:38:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna get the 11:15 to 3:45 on Tuesday
2014-10-08 09:38:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool?
2014-10-08 09:38:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh nevermind
2014-10-08 09:38:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that one is $36
2014-10-08 09:39:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2:50 to 6:45
2014-10-08 09:39:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hold on lemme check my flight
2014-10-08 09:40:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]check your Sunday one too
2014-10-08 09:40:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]3:45 would be better, then no one has to pick you up at dinner time 
2014-10-08 09:40:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll pay
2014-10-08 09:40:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's OK
2014-10-08 09:40:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what time should I come back
2014-10-08 09:40:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just
2014-10-08 09:40:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I get that one
2014-10-08 09:40:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and like the $51 one coming back
2014-10-08 09:40:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there might be better options
2014-10-08 09:41:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Greyhound was at least $70 one way and the flights were at least $100
2014-10-08 09:42:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but there's also the one way rental option
2014-10-08 09:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good
2014-10-08 09:43:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what time should I come back?
2014-10-08 09:43:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I leave at 9:30p Sunday
2014-10-08 09:44:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK I'll just take the 8:00 bus then
2014-10-08 09:44:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that cool?
2014-10-08 09:45:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]will you be getting in too late?
2014-10-08 09:45:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll have to get a Lyft or something
2014-10-08 09:45:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the buses that leave more in the middle of the day are $31
2014-10-08 09:45:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean $51
2014-10-08 09:45:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it'd still be cheaper
2014-10-08 09:46:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how early do you have to get to the bus stop?
2014-10-08 09:46:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not much
2014-10-08 09:47:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like 15 minutes I guess
2014-10-08 09:47:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hold on 1 sec before you buy
2014-10-08 09:47:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-08 09:47:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]gotta ask management
2014-10-08 09:47:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-10-08 09:48:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could get dropped off earlier too if that's more convenient
2014-10-08 09:52:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]mom says there is a katy megabus stop
2014-10-08 09:52:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-10-08 09:53:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they all go to Houston on the website
2014-10-08 09:55:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do the 3:45p
2014-10-08 09:56:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for getting in?
2014-10-08 09:56:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what about leaving?
2014-10-08 09:56:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes
2014-10-08 09:56:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and 8p
2014-10-08 09:56:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-08 09:57:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]there is a Katy Megabus stop but it doesn't look like any of these buses stop there
2014-10-08 09:57:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-08 09:57:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it doesn't even show up when you're trying to pick a leaving point
2014-10-08 09:57:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's not a big deal, she's going to pick me up at 1p, we'll get lunch, then pick you up
2014-10-08 09:57:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but when you click bus stops it shows it for houston
2014-10-08 09:57:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah but I'm saying none of the buses actually go or leave from there
2014-10-08 09:58:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe it's only to certain places
2014-10-08 09:58:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I can't imagine what those places would be if Dallas isn't one of them
2014-10-08 09:58:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Austin
2014-10-08 09:59:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it shows up for Austin and San Antonio
2014-10-08 09:59:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you don't come through Katy when traveling to Dallas
2014-10-08 09:59:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you go to Houston 1st
2014-10-08 09:59:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh so you're saying because it's on the way
2014-10-08 09:59:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and not because of demand
2014-10-08 10:01:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah, that'd make sense
2014-10-08 10:02:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]west houston is kinda big too
2014-10-08 10:02:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok well I'm glad that's taken care of
2014-10-08 10:02:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep, all bought
2014-10-08 10:02:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are we back in your room since your brother is gonna be there?
2014-10-08 10:03:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we're moving my bed to the guest bedroom lol
2014-10-08 10:04:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well that's accommodating 
2014-10-08 10:04:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Daniel says my bedroom freaks him out because its so big
2014-10-08 10:04:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha y'all are goofy
2014-10-08 10:04:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]definitely goofy
2014-10-08 10:05:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]everywhere I go on the internet I get vegas adds now
2014-10-08 10:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess you'll have to go back
2014-10-08 10:07:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I told mom you and I would make thanksgiving dessert
2014-10-08 10:08:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'll be fun    😃 
2014-10-08 10:08:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hurry up and get here!
2014-10-08 10:08:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't get any work done
2014-10-08 10:09:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha awww
2014-10-08 10:09:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to be there so bad
2014-10-08 10:10:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really have any work to do for Red Hat right now
2014-10-08 10:10:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we had a meeting on Friday where they were talking about this new stuff that they want me to be working on
2014-10-08 10:10:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they have to get all the data first
2014-10-08 10:11:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually fell back asleep after my alarm went off until 9:15 today
2014-10-08 10:11:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-08 10:12:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was wondering why you replied so late
2014-10-08 10:12:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought maybe you were exercising self control and not trying to wake me up early    😉 
2014-10-08 10:13:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you mostly message me first in the mornings these days!
2014-10-08 10:16:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hopefully that starts to happen again soon
2014-10-08 10:16:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]#lazy
2014-10-08 10:16:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]should I get destiny on ps3 or xbox360?
2014-10-08 10:17:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even know it
2014-10-08 10:18:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's one of the biggest games to come out this year?
2014-10-08 10:19:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've been waiting for my paycheck 
2014-10-08 10:19:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm not really in the gaming scene much anymore
2014-10-08 10:19:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and shooters aren't really my thing
2014-10-08 10:19:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you think we'll ever upgrade to nextgen?
2014-10-08 10:20:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably
2014-10-08 10:20:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can see myself buying a Wii U before anything else honestly
2014-10-08 10:20:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]those are pretty neat
2014-10-08 10:21:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the reason I ask is because this game and another I saw are offering free nextgen upgrades if you buy digital
2014-10-08 10:21:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.destinythegame.com/digital-upgrade
2014-10-08 10:22:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt it'd be worth it
2014-10-08 10:22:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It'll probably be cheap by the time we'd upgrade
2014-10-08 10:22:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-10-08 10:22:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-10-08 10:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's no reason to get a digital version
2014-10-08 10:22:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when we probably won't have a next-gen console for a while still
2014-10-08 10:22:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you can sell a physical copy
2014-10-08 10:23:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok, but if I buy it for 360 now, and then upgrade to a ps4 in a year I can't transfer all my shit
2014-10-08 10:23:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that wouldn't really bother me
2014-10-08 10:23:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how often do you go back to games you've beat?
2014-10-08 10:23:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you don't beat this game
2014-10-08 10:23:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]gosh, go look it up
2014-10-08 10:24:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant in general
2014-10-08 10:24:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]fairly often
2014-10-08 10:24:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm replaying Mass Effect 2 (very slowly) right now
2014-10-08 10:24:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so your account data isn't going to be stored in the cloud?
2014-10-08 10:24:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've replayed Dead Space 1
2014-10-08 10:24:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how would having a digital copy help in this situation
2014-10-08 10:24:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not a copy of your data
2014-10-08 10:24:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've played Zelda at least 11 times to completion
2014-10-08 10:25:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you can transfer all your data to your next gen
2014-10-08 10:25:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not XBox to PS4
2014-10-08 10:25:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]exactly!
2014-10-08 10:25:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's why I'm trying to decide which nextgen I may 1 day want to buy
2014-10-08 10:25:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-10-08 10:25:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]soooo
2014-10-08 10:26:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean I barely play games
2014-10-08 10:26:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the last game I played completely was Bioshock Infinite
2014-10-08 10:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so if we go next-gen it's gonna be because you want one
2014-10-08 10:27:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't even looked into the pros/cons of the systems
2014-10-08 10:27:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]honestly you might as well just build a computer if you want "the best" gaming experience
2014-10-08 10:27:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's whatever you want out of it
2014-10-08 10:27:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it seems like you use the XBox mostly
2014-10-08 10:28:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which would probably make transitioning to the XBox One smoother
2014-10-08 10:29:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-10-08 10:30:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you looked at recent games, maybe there's some you'd like
2014-10-08 10:30:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]something else to get in to
2014-10-08 10:30:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's why I said I think I'd get a Wii U
2014-10-08 10:30:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so many games on the PS and XBox are just shooters
2014-10-08 10:31:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think Nintendo games are more fun and creative a lot of hte times
2014-10-08 10:31:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like Last of Us bored me
2014-10-08 10:31:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so did Uncharted
2014-10-08 10:31:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and these are like the "best" games
2014-10-08 10:31:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]according to reviewers
2014-10-08 10:33:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]fair enough
2014-10-08 10:34:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I'm just old
2014-10-08 10:34:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-08 10:35:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]though looking at the Wii U list there's not as many I'd buy
2014-10-08 10:35:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://theevilwithin.com/en-us
2014-10-08 10:35:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what would you buy for other systems?
2014-10-08 10:36:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://theevilwithin.com/en-us
2014-10-08 10:36:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh I just sent that lol
2014-10-08 10:36:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-10-08 10:36:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that might be fun
2014-10-08 10:37:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The Last of Us maybe
2014-10-08 10:37:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the shooting mechanic is just not interesting to me

2014-10-08 10:37:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's something to consider too

2014-10-08 10:39:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]those are usually fun
2014-10-08 10:40:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'd definitely buy a Wii U actually
2014-10-08 10:40:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when we move in together
2014-10-08 10:40:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz Nintendo games are fun to play with other people too
2014-10-08 10:40:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like the Mario games

2014-10-08 10:41:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd be fun to get back into Smash Bros
2014-10-08 10:42:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]agreed
2014-10-08 10:42:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh I beat the Batman games

2014-10-08 10:42:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it was around the same time
2014-10-08 10:43:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]have you played half life?

2014-10-08 10:43:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]those have a little more to them than just a shooter in my opinion
2014-10-08 10:43:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I agree
2014-10-08 10:43:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]okkkkk I gotta go work

2014-10-08 15:28:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://literock969.com/how-common-is-your-birthday-chart-shows-most-least-common-birthdays-2/
2014-10-08 15:28:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]People having sex for the holidays?
2014-10-08 15:31:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Your birthday is pretty uncommon
2014-10-08 15:31:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]302nd
2014-10-08 15:39:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know 4 ppl with my birthday 
2014-10-08 15:39:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no shit
2014-10-08 15:39:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One of them a good friend from high school
2014-10-08 17:09:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cam is getting 6 rolls for me at $15 each
2014-10-08 17:09:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet.
2014-10-08 17:12:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I guess we have that option for Halloween if we want
2014-10-08 17:13:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. I'll let you make that decision haha
2014-10-08 17:15:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's going to be so tempting 
2014-10-08 17:16:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess what would stop you? People in the department knowing?
2014-10-08 17:17:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've done drugs "secretly" a couple times and it weirds me out a bit 
2014-10-08 17:18:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And yeah, I just don't know how most people would respond and I'd prefer to not be judged because of that 
2014-10-08 17:18:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean, 70% of people would totally not care
2014-10-08 17:18:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe even be jealous 
2014-10-08 17:18:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, what if we start making and and groping obscenely haha
2014-10-08 17:19:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Who would be jealous of what?
2014-10-08 17:19:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jealous we had drugs 
2014-10-08 17:19:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha that's a definite risk.
2014-10-08 17:19:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe you can ask people if they'd be interested?
2014-10-08 17:20:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]6 was the max I could get
2014-10-08 17:20:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Either because that's all his dealer had or he wants to maintain a reason for me to text him lol
2014-10-08 17:21:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll still try to get coke
2014-10-08 17:21:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we can save the mdma for another time 
2014-10-08 17:22:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish you were here oct 16
2014-10-08 17:22:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Glitch mob is playing at the Aragon 
2014-10-08 17:36:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man
2014-10-08 17:36:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah that'dbe fun
2014-10-08 17:36:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who is your coke contact?
2014-10-08 17:37:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the person you met at North Coast?
2014-10-08 18:24:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, a friend of Priyas
2014-10-08 18:26:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Zumba was killer today
2014-10-08 18:26:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I can go on Friday 
2014-10-08 18:27:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Otherwise I'll have zero flexibility for Saturday ;) 
2014-10-08 18:35:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Whoop whoop!
2014-10-08 18:46:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was actually thinking about how you put your legs during sex the other day
2014-10-08 18:55:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In what way?
2014-10-08 18:55:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well you usually put like your right leg up, right?
2014-10-08 18:56:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was trying to recall 100% how it worked and it's hard for me to visualize because I guess I'm not usually paying attention to your legs
2014-10-08 18:56:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-10-08 18:56:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think more often I put both up
2014-10-08 18:56:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But if I only put one OTS usually the right
2014-10-08 18:56:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can have a refresher
2014-10-08 18:56:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds good
2014-10-08 18:57:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so they're like both on my shoulders?
2014-10-08 18:57:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know that happens sometimes
2014-10-08 18:57:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-10-08 18:57:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that just what feels best for you?
2014-10-08 18:57:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes, it makes you go in deeper
2014-10-08 18:58:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-08 18:58:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But most of the time they're wrapped around your upper waist 
2014-10-08 18:58:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see
2014-10-08 18:58:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I'll pay attention more next time
2014-10-08 18:58:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-08 18:58:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]make a mental note
2014-10-08 18:59:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so does deeper = feel better?
2014-10-08 19:06:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I hopped in the shower
2014-10-08 19:06:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a different sensation 
2014-10-08 19:07:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like it when you fuck me slow and deep just about as much as hard and fast
2014-10-08 19:07:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha good to know
2014-10-08 19:07:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But starting out really deep can be uncomfortable sometimes 
2014-10-08 19:08:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm OK
2014-10-08 19:09:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what would be the best thing for me to do when starting out?
2014-10-08 19:09:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha you don't need to change anything!
2014-10-08 19:09:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh OK
2014-10-08 19:10:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to give you hard rules for how to have sex with me 
2014-10-08 19:10:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like the variety we have 
2014-10-08 19:10:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. I just don't want to be making you uncomfortable if I can avoid it, but I'm guessing you'll let me know if it's a problem
2014-10-08 19:11:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I usually tell you to go slow or something if I need it
2014-10-08 19:11:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that doesn't happen very often 
2014-10-08 19:11:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I was about to say
2014-10-08 19:11:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure if I remember that happening
2014-10-08 19:11:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've definitely directed me with fingering you and eating you out
2014-10-08 19:12:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe once or twice
2014-10-08 19:12:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Usually when we've had a bunch of sex already and I'm a little sore 
2014-10-08 19:12:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]makes sense
2014-10-08 19:14:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maaaan I'm excited for some Katherine lovin'
2014-10-08 19:15:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Google suggested I change your name to Katharine
2014-10-08 19:16:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] How did it do that?
2014-10-08 19:16:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It just underlined your name.
2014-10-08 19:16:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It wasn't a hard correction, though.
2014-10-08 19:16:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just a gray underline, not a red one.
2014-10-08 19:17:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you see they're making an all female Ghostbusters?
2014-10-08 19:22:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No they're not 
2014-10-08 19:22:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I read that Bill Murray was just kidding 
2014-10-08 19:22:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah it's for real now
2014-10-08 19:23:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the guy who directed Bridesmaids is doing it
2014-10-08 19:43:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bet it has half the cast of bridesmaids 
2014-10-08 19:43:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least
2014-10-08 19:43:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Man, cooking for one person sucks 
2014-10-08 19:44:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It takes the same amount of time as cooking for 2 people, but less payback
2014-10-08 19:44:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why is there less payback?
2014-10-08 19:45:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because there's less food
2014-10-08 19:45:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha what
2014-10-08 19:45:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can't you just make enough for two?
2014-10-08 19:45:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fewer people are fed
2014-10-08 19:45:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I don't want to eat 2 meals
2014-10-08 19:46:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I get bored with lots of leftovers 
2014-10-08 19:46:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's more that fewer people are fed?
2014-10-08 19:46:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All I'm trying to say is I'd rather make 2 people happy and full than 1 for the same amount of time and effort
2014-10-08 19:47:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well seven more months
2014-10-08 19:47:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you'll get to feed me all you want
2014-10-08 19:48:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and make me eat healthy all you want
2014-10-08 19:48:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz I KNOW that's coming
2014-10-08 19:48:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not healthy allll the time
2014-10-08 19:49:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have an appreciation for fatty, salty, fried  food
2014-10-08 19:49:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just not everyday 
2014-10-08 19:49:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We do need to find a salmon recipe you like
2014-10-08 19:49:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I love me some salmon
2014-10-08 19:49:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds good
2014-10-08 19:50:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you want for your birthday dinner?
2014-10-08 19:50:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't knowwwwww
2014-10-08 19:50:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha

2014-10-08 19:51:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We could go out to eat too
2014-10-08 19:51:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If we're doing the maze thing all day, might be better to save a big cooking fish for Monday
2014-10-08 19:52:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt the maze will be all day
2014-10-08 19:52:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm down with the dinner being Monday too
2014-10-08 19:52:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, all afternoon

2014-10-08 20:14:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok
2014-10-08 20:14:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but you don't like squash, or lots of mushrooms, or pickles?
2014-10-08 20:14:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no pickles
2014-10-08 20:14:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or eggplant?
2014-10-08 20:15:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no pickles
2014-10-08 20:15:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can do what you want with the rest
2014-10-08 20:15:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]pickle pasta
2014-10-08 20:15:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]mmmm
2014-10-08 20:15:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-08 20:16:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]when you visit, keep our plan to move in together on the dl
2014-10-08 20:16:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-08 20:16:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't told darcy yet
2014-10-08 20:16:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why's that?
2014-10-08 20:16:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-10-08 20:18:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel bad, because that night I went out with her to Liz's and the Cove she talked about how nice it was to finally have a roommate she could hang out with and how she's really happy I moved in and stuff
2014-10-08 20:18:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man    😕 
2014-10-08 20:19:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you don't necessarily have to move out
2014-10-08 20:19:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-10-08 20:19:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] 😕 
2014-10-08 20:19:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-08 20:19:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want cuddles every day at 6p!!
2014-10-08 20:19:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me two
2014-10-08 20:21:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've mentioned to her that you're thinking about moving to chicago after school. I'm gonna wait until after thanksgiving, and then maybe she'll just ask herself
2014-10-08 20:21:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or at least will have hung out with us together and be more understanding that I'm not necessarily leaving her but more moving in with you
2014-10-08 20:21:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]does that make sense?
2014-10-08 20:22:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it does... I guess you want to talk to her about it sooner than later so she can start making arrangements?
2014-10-08 20:22:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't imagine she'd have a problem with it
2014-10-08 20:22:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it just might be a bit of a bummer
2014-10-08 20:23:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and finding a person to move in is a hassle
2014-10-08 20:23:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's the nature of the beast
2014-10-08 20:23:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The way I'm kind of imagining it is that you stay here once you get done until we find a place
2014-10-08 20:24:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and you find a job
2014-10-08 20:24:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and if I'm doing a summer field season, you could sublet from me until you move in somewhere lol
2014-10-08 20:24:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I better have a job before I move up there
2014-10-08 20:24:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that makes sense
2014-10-08 20:24:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok, then just until we find a place we like
2014-10-08 20:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I have a job before I move up there
2014-10-08 20:25:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is what I'm planning on
2014-10-08 20:25:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was hoping to have a place
2014-10-08 20:25:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to move into
2014-10-08 20:25:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so you want me to find a place?
2014-10-08 20:25:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'm gonna visit a couple times
2014-10-08 20:26:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can maybe visit a couple weekends in a row
2014-10-08 20:26:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can find places online
2014-10-08 20:26:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and spend a couple weekends checking places out
2014-10-08 20:26:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If that's what you want
2014-10-08 20:27:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like you're not digging it
2014-10-08 20:27:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]my only concern was one of us being super busy, either with class or defending my proposal
2014-10-08 20:27:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-10-08 20:28:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we can think about it more when it's closer
2014-10-08 20:28:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's probably gonna be a little hectic
2014-10-08 20:29:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know you want to move as few times as possible
2014-10-08 21:37:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you like sweet potatoes
2014-10-08 21:37:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna go with no
2014-10-08 21:38:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think they're just weird to me
2014-10-08 21:38:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]good to know
2014-10-08 21:38:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm really not a fan of sweet potato fries
2014-10-08 21:38:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was going to make this
2014-10-08 21:38:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://thepigandquill.com/2013/04/21/sweet-potato-gnocchi-with-apples-bacon-balsamic/
2014-10-08 21:38:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I'll save it for a solo meal lol
2014-10-08 21:38:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean that might be good
2014-10-08 21:39:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd be a bunch of flavors together
2014-10-08 21:39:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not that I don't really like the taste of sweet potatos
2014-10-08 21:39:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just think they're kinda weird on their own
2014-10-08 21:39:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ehh I'll wait
2014-10-08 21:39:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to risk it
2014-10-08 21:39:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-10-08 21:40:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I have other options
2014-10-08 21:47:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]merrrr I don't wanna go to school tomorrow
2014-10-08 21:47:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me neither. I have an exam    😞 
2014-10-08 21:48:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I also volunteered to pik up someone from the airport for UChicago minority recruitment
2014-10-08 21:48:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]are you studying?
2014-10-08 21:48:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-08 21:48:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's algorithms
2014-10-08 21:48:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I don't feel that good about now
2014-10-08 21:48:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]after that quiz
2014-10-08 21:48:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if it's gonna be memorization based like that I don't like my odds
2014-10-08 21:53:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my mom just told me my due date was today
2014-10-08 21:53:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]awww
2014-10-08 21:54:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you just had to make everyone wait
2014-10-08 21:54:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess so
2014-10-08 21:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe algorithms will be better since you've been in class more?
2014-10-08 21:59:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you don't have to rely on wikipedia
2014-10-08 22:00:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't pay attention

2014-10-08 22:58:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]at the aragon
2014-10-08 22:58:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]want to do that?
2014-10-08 22:59:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sure
2014-10-08 22:59:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really care honestly
2014-10-08 22:59:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]listen to the music 1st, but I think you'd like it
2014-10-08 22:59:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oooooo or Flying Lotus on Friday Oct 24
2014-10-08 23:00:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's funny how often you use numbers for words like first and second
2014-10-08 23:00:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]etc.
2014-10-08 23:00:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]except you get in pretty late
2014-10-08 23:00:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying to type fast enough to keep up wit u
2014-10-08 23:00:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess it would just slow me down
2014-10-08 23:00:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I'd have to reach and look for the numbers
2014-10-08 23:01:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what time does Flying Lotus start?
2014-10-08 23:01:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it says doors open at 8p, and there is an opener
2014-10-08 23:01:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm guessing He wouldn't come on until 10?
2014-10-08 23:02:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably
2014-10-08 23:02:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not sure how late it'd go, though
2014-10-08 23:02:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This place has a lot of artists I like
2014-10-08 23:02:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://concordmusichall.com
2014-10-08 23:03:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]something to keep in mind, maybe when you're here over winter
2014-10-08 23:03:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cooool
2014-10-08 23:06:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe we should just rent a hotel room for $60 and entertain ourselves
2014-10-08 23:07:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that would be fun too
2014-10-08 23:27:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well I leave it up to you
2014-10-08 23:28:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we have 6, so we can do it at least 3 times before we run out
2014-10-08 23:28:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we only need one pill?
2014-10-08 23:28:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]they're 200 mg
2014-10-08 23:28:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]each
2014-10-08 23:29:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that big?
2014-10-08 23:29:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess maximum of 3 times
2014-10-08 23:29:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we took 200 mg last time
2014-10-08 23:29:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and Cam has done these before and says 1 makes him roll pretty hard
2014-10-08 23:29:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-08 23:29:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you could do 1.5 if you felt you needed it
2014-10-08 23:30:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I felt great last time so if that was 200 mg I should be fine
2014-10-08 23:31:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what I'd like to do
2014-10-08 23:31:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is go somewhere with a bunch of pretty lights
2014-10-08 23:31:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and music
2014-10-08 23:31:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and things to sit on

2014-10-08 23:38:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we should just make that for ourselves. Buy some colorful cheap strobe lights, make a playlist ahead of time(!), and suck on each other as much as we want
2014-10-08 23:39:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd definitely be fun!
2014-10-08 23:39:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and have a bar nearby with some cool vibes that we can go to if we want to get out of the room
2014-10-08 23:39:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I like the sound of that

2014-10-08 23:54:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the pool is indoors right?
2014-10-08 23:54:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it doesn't say
2014-10-08 23:55:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"indoor or outdoor"
2014-10-08 23:55:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if it's outdoor it doesn't matter
2014-10-08 23:55:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Similiar hotels are: These hotels include really nice independent hotels, plus brands similar to: Hyatt Courtyard by Marriott Four Points Doubletree Indigo Holiday Inn
2014-10-08 23:55:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok

2014-10-08 23:56:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it depends how bad we want a pool
2014-10-08 23:56:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is pretty hard to predict
2014-10-08 23:57:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The difference is $24
2014-10-08 23:57:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]which is really not that much
2014-10-08 23:57:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]might be the Essex

2014-10-09 12:03:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn!
2014-10-09 12:03:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]everything's just piling on today
2014-10-09 12:03:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need to do better about staying off my phone/computer when I have trouble sleeping 
2014-10-09 12:04:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think of something I want to look up and then do and it's a feedback loop of sleeplessness 
2014-10-09 12:04:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah that definitely doesn't help
2014-10-09 12:05:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so did you sleep at all last night?
2014-10-09 12:05:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]part of it is probably you were staying up late on Pacific time for several nights
2014-10-09 12:06:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is basically morning CST
2014-10-09 12:06:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-10-09 12:08:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Regrettable decisions won

2014-10-09 12:09:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Land of the lost 
2014-10-09 12:09:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what day is the party?
2014-10-09 12:10:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think the 25. Jon(even though he was a staunch supporter of the 25) at the last minute said they could actually only host of the 31
2014-10-09 12:11:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But a 1st year stepped up
2014-10-09 12:11:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For the 25
2014-10-09 12:11:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-10-09 12:18:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone on the planning committee suggested that a banner saying "Welcome to graduate school" should be at the front door lol
2014-10-09 12:18:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-10-09 12:18:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was kinda leaning towards going as myself again too
2014-10-09 12:19:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if you come up with a couple costume I'd be down
2014-10-09 12:19:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well what should I do?
2014-10-09 12:19:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you want to be?
2014-10-09 12:19:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dress up as Brett?
2014-10-09 12:19:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-09 12:20:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]harsh
2014-10-09 12:20:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A little bit 
2014-10-09 12:20:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate this theme 
2014-10-09 12:20:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't think of anything 
2014-10-09 12:21:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I'm not really crazy about it
2014-10-09 12:22:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So maybe we'll save the pumpkin patch for next visit?
2014-10-09 12:22:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why's that
2014-10-09 12:23:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK cuz it'll be closer to Halloween?
2014-10-09 12:23:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*oh
2014-10-09 12:23:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I want to go to the museum in the afternoon lol 
2014-10-09 12:23:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Esp since I'll probably take Tuesday morning off

2014-10-09 12:29:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm definitely falling asleep at evmorph
2014-10-09 12:29:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-09 12:29:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's the topic tonight?
2014-10-09 12:31:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Biogeography evolution patterns neo/paleo method combining 
2014-10-09 12:31:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-10-09 12:33:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I actually think I'll dig it 
2014-10-09 12:33:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-10-09 12:33:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-10-09 12:33:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too
2014-10-09 12:44:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is this too inappropriate for an Instagram tbt?
2014-10-09 12:44:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't mind
2014-10-09 12:45:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when was that?
2014-10-09 12:46:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hotel in Dallas 
2014-10-09 12:46:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even remember you taking that
2014-10-09 12:46:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-09 12:46:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a pretty cute picture, though!
2014-10-09 12:46:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We had just woken up
2014-10-09 12:46:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love it
2014-10-09 12:47:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too
2014-10-09 12:47:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you look really happy
2014-10-09 12:47:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to be getting squished by me
2014-10-09 12:49:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of course!
2014-10-09 12:49:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should think of a cocktail you like for Bacardi rum
2014-10-09 12:49:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or else a mixer
2014-10-09 12:50:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why's that
2014-10-09 12:50:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We have a shit ton
2014-10-09 12:50:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-10-09 12:50:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Darcy wants to get rid of it
2014-10-09 12:50:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not really crazy about rum
2014-10-09 12:50:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but maybe there's a good cocktail out there
2014-10-09 12:54:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]any rum cocktails you like
2014-10-09 12:54:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-10-09 12:54:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Frozen fruity ones 
2014-10-09 12:54:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-10-09 12:54:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But they're never my favorite 
2014-10-09 12:54:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe banana mamas? 
2014-10-09 12:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like mojitos alright
2014-10-09 12:54:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though a frozen drink seems silly and inefficient 
2014-10-09 12:55:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found a Moscow mule punch size recipe 
2014-10-09 12:55:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And have a cute pitcher to make them in
2014-10-09 12:56:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds good
2014-10-09 12:58:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cuba libres
2014-10-09 12:58:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Rum and coke with lime
2014-10-09 13:02:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]alcohol completely ruins Coke
2014-10-09 13:02:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't like Coke as a mixer
2014-10-09 13:02:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha well it turns it into a different flavor
2014-10-09 13:02:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's good to know though
2014-10-09 13:03:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I pretty much like lighter, refreshing stuff if I'm gonna be drinking several
2014-10-09 13:08:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-10-09 13:08:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found a couple 
2014-10-09 13:09:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm gonna make a bunch of recipes and tape them up around the bar so people can make drinks with what we have 
2014-10-09 13:09:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a good idea!
2014-10-09 13:10:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish we had 1 more strainer though 
2014-10-09 13:11:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ahhhh I'm so excited for this weekend
2014-10-09 13:12:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Focus on studying!
2014-10-09 13:12:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]boooo
2014-10-09 13:12:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No more talking about it until after 
2014-10-09 13:12:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I also need to knock out this grant today
2014-10-09 13:13:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fiiine
2014-10-09 13:13:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-09 13:13:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll talk to you tonight
2014-10-09 13:13:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love youuuuuuuuuuu
2014-10-09 13:14:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]💛💙💜💚❤️💛💙💜💚❤️💛💙💜💚❤️💓💕💖💞💓💕💖💞💗💗💋
2014-10-09 13:15:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahahaha
2014-10-09 13:15:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're bokners
2014-10-09 16:29:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you like the taste of baileys?
2014-10-09 17:40:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do.
2014-10-09 18:58:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wanted to make cookies and cream pudding shots 
2014-10-09 18:58:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I couldn't find the right pudding anywhere!
2014-10-09 18:59:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whaaaat
2014-10-09 18:59:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think cookies and cream pudding exists 
2014-10-09 18:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I can make a chocolate one with baileys and Oreo garnish 
2014-10-09 18:59:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.jello.com/product/pudding-mousse-desserts/oreo-cookies-'n-cr%C3%A8me
2014-10-09 19:01:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well it wasn't at target or treasure island 
2014-10-09 19:01:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lame
2014-10-09 19:03:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Next birthday 
2014-10-09 19:03:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure you can order them from somewhere 
2014-10-09 19:03:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm sure the chocolate pudding will be good
2014-10-09 19:04:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It won't be perfect wahhhhg
2014-10-09 19:04:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha no it definitely will
2014-10-09 19:04:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I went a little overboard with the shopping today 
2014-10-09 19:04:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh yeah?
2014-10-09 19:04:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what'd you get?
2014-10-09 19:05:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Stuff for your dinner. It's going to be really tasty 
2014-10-09 19:05:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yayy
2014-10-09 19:06:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]2 bags of donkey chips, stuff for the cake, 2 12 packs of beer, stuff for the pudding shots including mini ice cream cones
2014-10-09 19:06:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tonic water
2014-10-09 19:06:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lines
2014-10-09 19:06:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*limes
2014-10-09 19:06:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oj
2014-10-09 19:06:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you throwing a party or something?
2014-10-09 19:07:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, treasure island is having a 10% off deal for Uchicago students 
2014-10-09 19:07:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But they ran out of the little cards
2014-10-09 19:07:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And said they won't have new ones for a few weeks 
2014-10-09 19:07:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fucking bulkshit 
2014-10-09 19:07:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like a rewards card?
2014-10-09 19:08:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just 10% off if you have an ID
2014-10-09 19:08:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you can't just use your ID for some reason 
2014-10-09 19:08:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have to use your ID to get a card?
2014-10-09 19:09:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-10-09 19:09:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's some bull shit
2014-10-09 19:10:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would've bought more stuff at target had I known 
2014-10-09 19:10:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was your test?
2014-10-09 19:10:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not great
2014-10-09 19:10:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-09 19:10:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh
2014-10-09 19:10:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good
2014-10-09 19:11:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If I end up not doing well in this class I think the worst-case scenario is I need to take four classes next semester
2014-10-09 19:11:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but hopefully it doesn't come down to that
2014-10-09 19:11:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hopefully I do better than enough of the other students to get a B
2014-10-09 19:12:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you didn't go with the nude #tbt I see
2014-10-09 19:13:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nah 
2014-10-09 19:14:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll save that for another Thursday 
2014-10-09 19:15:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure you'll do better than you think 
2014-10-09 19:15:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tonight has been surprisingly alcohol heavy 
2014-10-09 19:15:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah?
2014-10-09 19:16:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There was a big lecture with reception after
2014-10-09 19:16:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With free prosecco
2014-10-09 19:16:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Kate said we could bring beer to TA class 
2014-10-09 19:16:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol what
2014-10-09 19:17:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like every week?
2014-10-09 19:17:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And now I'm in my office drinking whiskey alone lol
2014-10-09 19:17:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, just from the reception 
2014-10-09 19:17:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-10-09 19:17:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was in the bslc lobby 
2014-10-09 19:18:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still got EvMorph too, right?
2014-10-09 19:22:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-10-09 19:22:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At 7:30
2014-10-09 21:07:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, evmorph got heated 
2014-10-09 21:07:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like Rick ree just tore the speaker a new one 
2014-10-09 21:08:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol oh yeah? What happened?
2014-10-09 21:08:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well Rick made the most commonly used biogeographic model 
2014-10-09 21:09:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And this guy took ricks model and added founder event speciation probability as a parameter 
2014-10-09 21:09:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then did model testing and showed that for almost every case his model was a better fit 
2014-10-09 21:10:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Including for a bunch of ricks data 
2014-10-09 21:11:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Rick said that founder speciation was not a viable parameter in his model because his model did not model speciation events but continuos range expansion/contraction events 
2014-10-09 21:12:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that by calling founder speciation its own parameter it was comparing different probability distrubutions and the model fit would obviously always be better BC it was 3 free parameters vs 2
2014-10-09 21:13:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then! Rick said that the guy was "doing his simulations completely wrong" 
2014-10-09 21:13:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In front of everyone 
2014-10-09 21:13:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yowza
2014-10-09 21:14:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so how do people actually test their models?
2014-10-09 21:14:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like
2014-10-09 21:14:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in machine learning
2014-10-09 21:14:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have a test set
2014-10-09 21:14:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]AIC
2014-10-09 21:14:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and if you do well on it
2014-10-09 21:15:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's that?
2014-10-09 21:15:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Likelihood scores of data given the various models 
2014-10-09 21:15:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Compare the log likelihood 
2014-10-09 21:15:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-09 21:15:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-10-09 21:15:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's kinda bull shit
2014-10-09 21:15:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-09 21:15:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no offense
2014-10-09 21:15:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's one thing I really don't like about biology
2014-10-09 21:16:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]him saying the extra parameter isn't valid or whtever
2014-10-09 21:16:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is bull shit
2014-10-09 21:16:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just make some predictions with the model
2014-10-09 21:16:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and see who's model does better
2014-10-09 21:16:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The guy did (sort of) in his simulations 
2014-10-09 21:16:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And still showed his model did better 
2014-10-09 21:17:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was the data simulated, though?
2014-10-09 21:17:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But rocks 2nd point was he did those simulations wrong 
2014-10-09 21:17:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like this stuff just would not fly in machine learning research
2014-10-09 21:17:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can definitely see that point
2014-10-09 21:17:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're both wrong
2014-10-09 21:17:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as far as I'm concerned
2014-10-09 21:17:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-10-09 21:17:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can't predict evolutoin
2014-10-09 21:17:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sucks
2014-10-09 21:17:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's what I've concluded
2014-10-09 21:17:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How do you know Rick is wrong? 
2014-10-09 21:18:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]saying an extra parameter makes the model a better fit does not make the parameter worthless or incorrect
2014-10-09 21:18:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Noooo
2014-10-09 21:18:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was because the extra parameter wasn't really a parameter 
2014-10-09 21:19:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a binary possibility at each node (did founder speciation occur or not) while the other parameters were continuous processes  
2014-10-09 21:20:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the model did not reflect that 
2014-10-09 21:20:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did not reflect what?
2014-10-09 21:20:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that one was binary?
2014-10-09 21:20:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the other were continuous?
2014-10-09 21:20:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess 
2014-10-09 21:20:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's nothing wrong with that
2014-10-09 21:20:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok nvm 
2014-10-09 21:21:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's hard for me to describe the situation in vague terms over text, and you are determined to take everything negatively towards my field  
2014-10-09 21:22:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-10-09 21:22:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]k
2014-10-09 21:22:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why don't these models just predict the number of speciation events or something?
2014-10-09 21:22:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from a certain clade
2014-10-09 21:22:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know what the point of the model is I guess
2014-10-09 21:22:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what a node is 
2014-10-09 21:22:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A cladogenesis event 
2014-10-09 21:23:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right 
2014-10-09 21:23:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so rather than just fit the models too data
2014-10-09 21:23:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fit the models to some data
2014-10-09 21:23:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and predict other ones
2014-10-09 21:23:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Biogeographers take a phylogeny derived from molecular or morphological data  
2014-10-09 21:23:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]other data you have
2014-10-09 21:23:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so look at one clade
2014-10-09 21:23:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fit it
2014-10-09 21:23:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whatever
2014-10-09 21:23:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]predict another clade
2014-10-09 21:23:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the one that's better wins
2014-10-09 21:23:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just fitting models you get into this bull shit
2014-10-09 21:24:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with people arguing over which parameters are valid
2014-10-09 21:24:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who gives a fuck
2014-10-09 21:24:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh my god!
2014-10-09 21:24:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]predict the outcome
2014-10-09 21:24:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't know what biogeographers do
2014-10-09 21:24:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know
2014-10-09 21:24:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know anything about biology
2014-10-09 21:24:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry I should have explained that 
2014-10-09 21:24:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you always tell me
2014-10-09 21:25:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why do you always have to assume no one in biology is going your ideas?
2014-10-09 21:25:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You act like you're smarter than all biologists 
2014-10-09 21:25:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not
2014-10-09 21:25:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's my issue 
2014-10-09 21:25:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-09 21:25:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not how I act
2014-10-09 21:26:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's silly to argue over these things honestly
2014-10-09 21:26:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and demean people
2014-10-09 21:26:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because no one actually knows who is right
2014-10-09 21:30:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I do know what biogeographers do
2014-10-09 21:30:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which solidifies my point
2014-10-09 21:30:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can't make predictions with the models
2014-10-09 21:31:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or I guess you can try
2014-10-09 21:31:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but no model is going to be able to accurately simulate evolution and the history of Earth
2014-10-09 21:31:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to the point that it'll be able to predict biogeographical patterns
2014-10-09 21:31:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is why everyone just fits their models to data
2014-10-09 21:34:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we should just stop trying? 
2014-10-09 21:34:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-09 21:34:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]umm
2014-10-09 21:34:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think that should be publicly funded
2014-10-09 21:34:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-09 21:36:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you really gotta stop shitting on me
2014-10-09 21:37:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or talking to me like I'm an idiot
2014-10-09 23:20:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let's not fight like this right before we see each other 
2014-10-09 23:32:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I also don't know where I talked to you like an idiot 
2014-10-09 23:34:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except maybe the biogeographers one, but even then you had just admitted you didn't understand the point of the model 
2014-10-09 23:34:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't like that you respond that way every time I disagree with you 
2014-10-09 23:35:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Respond what way?
2014-10-09 23:37:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That I'm shitting on you or talking to you like an idiot. I'm just disagreeing with you
2014-10-09 23:38:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You did shit in biologists though 
2014-10-09 23:38:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Without knowing all the information 
2014-10-09 23:38:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that happens pretty frequently 
2014-10-09 23:38:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What did I miss?
2014-10-09 23:39:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's condescending 
2014-10-09 23:42:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought that was pretty light
2014-10-09 23:42:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said I agreed with Rick's point literally the previous statement
2014-10-09 23:43:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hadn't even told you how the simulations were done and you said they were both wrong.
2014-10-09 23:43:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I do a good job giving you all the information 
2014-10-09 23:43:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In these situations 
2014-10-09 23:43:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't like how your attitude always goes to the negative about my field 
2014-10-09 23:43:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is "your field"
2014-10-09 23:44:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this isn't a negative attitude towards "your field"
2014-10-09 23:44:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's a negative attitude towards certain types of model building and validationg
2014-10-09 23:44:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]validation
2014-10-09 23:46:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We don't know the actual number of speciation events, or the actual processes of range expansion/contraction 
2014-10-09 23:46:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we can't check which model is more correct 
2014-10-09 23:46:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]exactly
2014-10-09 23:46:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that is not awesome to me
2014-10-09 23:47:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but we don't have to talk about that I guess
2014-10-09 23:47:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So people are using the best statistical test they have at their disposal 
2014-10-09 23:47:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't you think it's better than nothing? 
2014-10-09 23:47:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No one says their model is %100 correct 
2014-10-09 23:47:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or even mostly correct 
2014-10-09 23:47:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get that
2014-10-09 23:48:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it fits the data better
2014-10-09 23:48:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that gets to Rick's point
2014-10-09 23:48:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Until you come up with a new model that fits even better I guess
2014-10-09 23:48:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]about how you can just add parameters
2014-10-09 23:48:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it'll fit better
2014-10-09 23:48:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like
2014-10-09 23:48:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in machine learning
2014-10-09 23:48:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can get really high accuracy
2014-10-09 23:48:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on your training set
2014-10-09 23:48:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]by using a bunch of parameters
2014-10-09 23:49:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but your ability to predict NEW instances
2014-10-09 23:49:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]will go down at a point
2014-10-09 23:49:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the model needs to be able to generalie
2014-10-09 23:49:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]generalize
2014-10-09 23:49:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is why simpler models are prefered
2014-10-09 23:49:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the way you VALIDATE
2014-10-09 23:49:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that
2014-10-09 23:49:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is by actually testing it on unseen data
2014-10-09 23:49:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's the missing step here
2014-10-09 23:51:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Rick would like more parameters in the model too, not just for statistical reasons 
2014-10-09 23:51:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He just didn't think this one added was a parameter at all
2014-10-09 23:52:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except it obviously did something?
2014-10-09 23:52:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm so sorry I brought this up in passing 
2014-10-09 23:52:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too
2014-10-09 23:53:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool
2014-10-09 23:53:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight 
2014-10-09 23:57:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-09 23:57:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not an idiot
2014-10-09 23:57:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-09 23:57:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my criticisms
2014-10-09 23:57:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are not irrational
2014-10-09 23:57:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they aren't even mean-spirited
2014-10-09 23:58:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I never ever fucking said you were an idiot 
2014-10-09 23:58:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you're one of the most intelligent men I've ever met 
2014-10-09 23:58:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-10-09 23:59:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]   Why do you always have to assume no one in biology is going your ideas? You act like you're smarter than all biologists
2014-10-09 23:59:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]stuff like that
2014-10-09 23:59:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]makes it sound like you aren't taking me seriously
2014-10-09 23:59:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and like my opinions aren't valid
2014-10-10 00:00:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wikipedia says this about the Akaike information criterion
2014-10-10 00:00:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"AIC does not provide a test of a model in the sense of testing a null hypothesis; i.e. AIC can tell nothing about the quality of the model in an absolute sense. If all the candidate models fit poorly, AIC will not give any warning of that."
2014-10-10 00:00:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that is ALL I was trying to say
2014-10-10 00:00:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you just got super defensive
2014-10-10 00:01:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You called it "bullshit"
2014-10-10 00:02:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then generalizing something you interpreted from my comment to all of biology 
2014-10-10 00:02:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Using bulkshit methods 
2014-10-10 00:02:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the methods are not bull shit
2014-10-10 00:02:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That wouldn't fly in your field 
2014-10-10 00:02:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]statistics are valid
2014-10-10 00:02:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]AIC
2014-10-10 00:02:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is a good measure
2014-10-10 00:02:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for building models
2014-10-10 00:02:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it doesn't validate the model
2014-10-10 00:02:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's useful for building good models
2014-10-10 00:02:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then you have to test it
2014-10-10 00:03:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well they are building models right now 
2014-10-10 00:03:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's the stage that field of research is in 
2014-10-10 00:03:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The first nonverbal biogeographic model was like 10-15 years ago  
2014-10-10 00:04:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You were aggressive and antagonistic 
2014-10-10 00:05:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And turned a comment I made about something that happened during my day into a debate 
2014-10-10 00:05:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-10-10 00:05:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was not turning it into a debate
2014-10-10 00:05:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you didn't have to get defensive
2014-10-10 00:06:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just supposed to accept what you were saying and stop explaining a situation I thought you were misinterpreting?
2014-10-10 00:06:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-10-10 00:07:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]" It's hard for me to describe the situation in vague terms over text, and you are determined to take everything negatively towards my field    "  
2014-10-10 00:07:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm telling you I interpreted your comments as aggressive and unbased. Maybe you didn't mean them that way, but that doesn't change how I feel when you talk like that 
2014-10-10 00:08:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was the first aggressive message
2014-10-10 00:08:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in my opinion
2014-10-10 00:08:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said the log likeiihood thing is kinda bull shit
2014-10-10 00:08:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]before that
2014-10-10 00:08:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I didn't think that was aggressive
2014-10-10 00:08:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's how I would talk to Jon or Tim or any other grad student
2014-10-10 00:09:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't say the guy was obviously an idiot
2014-10-10 00:09:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You said bullshit twice and indicated his actions were indicative of all biology 
2014-10-10 00:09:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I'm too sensitive 
2014-10-10 00:10:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said that's one thing I don't really like about biology
2014-10-10 00:10:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I stand by it
2014-10-10 00:13:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] I'm trying to drop this 
2014-10-10 00:13:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you want to gain from continuing this conversation? Proving to me that I'm the asshole, not you? 
2014-10-10 00:14:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At this point, we've both made each other unhappy and I'm over it 
2014-10-10 00:14:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll just not comment on things like that going forward
2014-10-10 00:15:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Great, we won't discuss topics that intersect our research interests 
2014-10-10 00:15:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's exactly how I want to spend the rest of my life 
2014-10-10 00:15:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't say we can't discuss it
2014-10-10 00:16:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I apparently can't be critical without you feeling like I'm attacking you and your field
2014-10-10 00:16:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it really doesn't matter
2014-10-10 00:16:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in the grand scheme of things
2014-10-10 00:16:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can still talk about your research
2014-10-10 00:18:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's funny, I feel like I can't disagree with you without you thinking I'm attacking your personal intelligence. 
2014-10-10 00:18:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not when you disagree
2014-10-10 00:18:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Either we're both shitty to each other or both poor listeners 
2014-10-10 00:19:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you personally attack me
2014-10-10 00:19:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when I'm just going after the methods
2014-10-10 00:20:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where did I personally attack you?
2014-10-10 00:20:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"

 you are determined to take everything negatively towards my field"
2014-10-10 00:20:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"

  You don't know what biogeographers do"
2014-10-10 00:20:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"

 Why do you always have to assume no one in biology is going your ideas? You act like you're smarter than all biologists"
2014-10-10 00:21:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you like me to list yet again the comments you made where I felt you were attacking me field?
2014-10-10 00:21:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unfairly 
2014-10-10 00:22:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think I was attacking the methods unfairly
2014-10-10 00:23:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Without knowing all the information 
2014-10-10 00:23:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Seriously though, goodnight.
2014-10-10 00:23:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even if that was the case
2014-10-10 00:23:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you attacked me
2014-10-10 00:23:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was never coming after you
2014-10-10 00:24:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whatever
2014-10-10 00:24:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this put a nice damper on my excitement
2014-10-10 01:08:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Sorry I was a bitch 
2014-10-10 09:36:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't have to come any more if you're not going to be happy to see me 
2014-10-10 09:40:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But if you are coming, you should check into your flight now lol
2014-10-10 10:11:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And pack an umbrella of you have one 
2014-10-10 10:12:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are we supposed to get rained on?
2014-10-10 10:12:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's storming on Monday 
2014-10-10 10:13:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And probably Sunday too
2014-10-10 10:13:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my umbrella is small and shitty
2014-10-10 10:13:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my umbrella doesn't fit in my bag
2014-10-10 10:23:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha ok I'll buy one
2014-10-10 10:23:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will you bring your guitar?
2014-10-10 10:23:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you want me to?
2014-10-10 10:25:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure 
2014-10-10 10:25:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since you can check a bag for free
2014-10-10 10:26:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was I supposed to say I was checking a bag when I checked in
2014-10-10 11:05:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-10-10 11:05:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They have an express bag drop if you already have a boarding pass 
2014-10-10 11:05:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK

2014-10-10 11:27:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of course
2014-10-10 11:28:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can talk about that discussion sometime in person and what went wrong. But I'm ok with tabling it for a few days if you are. 
2014-10-10 11:28:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you really not excited to see me anymore?
2014-10-10 11:29:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was never not excited, I just felt less excited last night.
2014-10-10 11:37:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:/

2014-10-10 16:53:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're gonna need to chop out whole sentences.
2014-10-10 16:53:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I probably should've asked you that before I started editing
2014-10-10 16:54:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry I thought I told you 
2014-10-10 16:59:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Does it include that thing at the end?

2014-10-10 17:12:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Actually, one sentence should do it.
2014-10-10 17:24:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, I'll play with it 
2014-10-10 17:25:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cathy actually wants me to add stuff 
2014-10-10 17:25:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You're basically gonna have to drop a sentence for every one you want to add then
2014-10-10 17:27:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Does your mom think I look like a model, or is that a different Michael?

2014-10-10 21:01:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never used a vibrator before so you might have to coach me up a bit
2014-10-10 21:02:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never had one used on me
2014-10-10 21:02:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooh a new experience for both of us    😃

2014-10-10 22:16:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it did feel like an invasion of privacy
2014-10-10 22:16:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry 
2014-10-10 22:17:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I don't find that stuff particularly embarrassing or whatever 
2014-10-10 22:17:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially among ppl I'm close with 
2014-10-10 22:17:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I can definitely be more respectful

2014-10-10 22:31:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though it's very frantic feeling 
2014-10-10 22:31:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like "omg fuck fuck fuck die you fucker"
2014-10-10 22:33:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna marry you 
2014-10-10 22:33:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In case you didn't know

2014-10-10 22:49:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Playing Dead Space. I cannot get past this fucking part.
2014-10-10 22:50:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hate when that happens 
2014-10-10 22:50:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then you have to save there 
2014-10-10 22:50:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With no anmo and shirty health 
2014-10-10 22:50:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah it's getting pretty annoying.

2014-10-10 22:55:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Being a lonely woman is not terrible sometimes 
2014-10-10 22:55:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it was also only $2
2014-10-10 22:56:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha they just gave it to you?
2014-10-10 22:57:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I asked for the check and the manager said "if that's all you're getting, it's on us. Come back and see us sometime for dinner"
2014-10-10 22:57:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean it was a totally good marketing ploy 
2014-10-10 22:58:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to go back immediately 
2014-10-10 22:58:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice.

2014-10-10 23:10:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How'd you get the shopping bag one?
2014-10-10 23:11:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got it in Vegas 
2014-10-10 23:11:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Doesn't really make sense 
2014-10-10 23:12:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess people shop a lot in Vegas
2014-10-10 23:13:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True 
2014-10-10 23:14:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't checked in anywhere since September 20th haha
2014-10-10 23:14:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I got it after checking in to a hotel 
2014-10-10 23:15:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did I not check you in at the no label brewery?
2014-10-10 23:15:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That was the 20th
2014-10-10 23:15:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ah
2014-10-10 23:15:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhh I just got a text from Daniela about falcon inN
2014-10-10 23:15:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I literally just put my pjs on 
2014-10-10 23:16:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha
2014-10-10 23:17:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I usually have a little more fomo than this, but I'm totally content with staying in bed
2014-10-10 23:17:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My last night of Kitty snugs for a few days ;)
2014-10-10 23:18:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd never heard fomo before
2014-10-10 23:18:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fear of missing out 
2014-10-10 23:18:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I looked it up
2014-10-10 23:18:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It got popular a little after yolo
2014-10-10 23:19:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least in my generation 
2014-10-10 23:19:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm too old for that stuff
2014-10-10 23:19:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Apparently lol 
2014-10-10 23:19:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]doesn't sound like I'm missing out
2014-10-10 23:19:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-10 23:19:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's funny how sharp those divides can be 
2014-10-10 23:19:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol
2014-10-10 23:20:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah there are a lot things that have to come together I guess for memes like that to spread
2014-10-10 23:20:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and high school/college are the perfect breeding grounds
2014-10-10 23:26:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True 
2014-10-10 23:26:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I decided to stay in 
2014-10-10 23:27:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The only ppl there are probably Daniela and Shane, Dallas and his tinder date, and a couple 1st years. 
2014-10-10 23:27:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dallas got a Tinder date?
2014-10-10 23:28:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol yeah, apparently he blew her off for the show and she came down to hyde park instead 
2014-10-10 23:28:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She was pretty cute 
2014-10-10 23:28:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it seems like a good idea
2014-10-10 23:28:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-10-10 23:29:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Tinder
2014-10-10 23:30:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess 
2014-10-10 23:30:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that the app where the people have to agree or something?
2014-10-10 23:30:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think it would be my matchmaker of choice 
2014-10-10 23:31:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's you choose if a person is "attractive or not" and if you both think the other person is attractive you're aatch 
2014-10-10 23:31:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*match 
2014-10-10 23:31:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-10 23:31:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've actually heard a lot of chicks on there aren't actually trying to get with anyone and just want to see how many dudes like them, which is kinda shitty
2014-10-10 23:32:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they should kick people out if they don't accept x% or something
2014-10-10 23:32:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, my old college roommate sort of did that 
2014-10-10 23:32:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If more she liked rating ppl
2014-10-10 23:32:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And judging them 
2014-10-10 23:33:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But had no desire to communicate with anyone 
2014-10-10 23:33:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-10 23:33:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Okcupid seems a lot more rigorous in terms of matching 
2014-10-10 23:33:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I'm gonna take the time to go on a pseudo blind date 
2014-10-10 23:34:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt, but it also seems kinda more serious I guess
2014-10-10 23:34:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like more pressure
2014-10-10 23:34:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want some confidence we'll also be good together 
2014-10-10 23:34:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we should make OKCupid profiles and see if we're matches
2014-10-10 23:34:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There are tons of PPl explicitly looking just for a hookup on okc
2014-10-10 23:35:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what?
2014-10-10 23:35:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In response to your "more serious comment"
2014-10-10 23:35:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I changed it to more pressure
2014-10-10 23:35:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I guess it does take more time to make a profile 
2014-10-10 23:36:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*more effort 
2014-10-10 23:36:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think there's more pressure
2014-10-10 23:36:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because you're supposed to be compatible
2014-10-10 23:36:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]higher expectations
2014-10-10 23:36:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh, maybe maybe not 
2014-10-10 23:36:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whereas Tinder it's more like who gives a fuck
2014-10-10 23:36:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not really sure how that feels 
2014-10-10 23:37:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A blind date probably always has some pressure associated with it 
2014-10-10 23:37:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-10-10 23:37:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I'd feel any pressure on a Tinder date
2014-10-10 23:37:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And dudes on okc will message anyone that pops up in their matches that they find attractive 
2014-10-10 23:38:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know if most dudes just looking for a fun time will feel pressure on a date from either site 
2014-10-10 23:38:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's true
2014-10-10 23:39:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least from okc you probably my know the other person is also looking for something casual 
2014-10-10 23:39:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]isn't the assumption with Tinder that everything is casual?
2014-10-10 23:40:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno 
2014-10-10 23:40:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess 
2014-10-10 23:40:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-10-10 23:40:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're going on a date with someone purely on looks
2014-10-10 23:40:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-10 23:40:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what more could you expect
2014-10-10 23:40:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do want to see our OKCupid match score or whatever
2014-10-10 23:40:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how would we do that
2014-10-10 23:41:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We probably have to say we're in the same city 
2014-10-10 23:41:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah I made a profile once
2014-10-10 23:41:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my username is gone
2014-10-10 23:41:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have too 
2014-10-10 23:41:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I deleted it within five minutes
2014-10-10 23:41:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-10-10 23:41:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't remember anything about the site
2014-10-10 23:42:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe one day we can set aside a couple hours to answer questions and then one of us finds the other based on username and it will calculate scores 
2014-10-10 23:43:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We gotta answer a lot of questions though 
2014-10-10 23:43:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-10-10 23:43:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we know in what level we match for a variety of topics 
2014-10-10 23:44:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-10-10 23:44:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm really curious now
2014-10-10 23:44:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha 
2014-10-10 23:44:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not an activity for tonight, but we can deg do it 
2014-10-10 23:44:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometime 
2014-10-10 23:45:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-10 23:45:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm getting pretty sleepy. All the food is getting to me

2014-10-10 23:49:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I saw that too, but it seems to be updating
2014-10-10 23:49:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's why I originally said 1:25
2014-10-10 23:50:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when you Google 

  Southwest Airlines Flight 1326    
2014-10-10 23:50:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it says schedule 1:25
2014-10-10 23:50:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then 1:04 big underneath
2014-10-10 23:50:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I don't know what's going on
2014-10-10 23:50:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The southwest flight status says 1:25
2014-10-10 23:50:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll check again in the morning 
2014-10-10 23:50:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-10 23:51:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you checking a bag?

2014-10-10 23:53:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-10-10 23:53:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If that 
2014-10-10 23:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah true
2014-10-10 23:54:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'll just have to prime me up on the drive back    😉 
2014-10-10 23:55:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never given road head while driving 
2014-10-10 23:55:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'd be interesting 
2014-10-10 23:55:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha not the safest thing
2014-10-11 00:07:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I guess I'll go to bed.
2014-10-11 00:07:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Goodnight. I love you!
2014-10-11 00:08:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woah yeah sorry
2014-10-11 00:08:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was drifting I love you 
2014-10-11 00:08:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]See you soon
2014-10-11 04:27:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My throat is sore! And one of the tonsils are swollen!
2014-10-11 05:56:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a dream where I took like a bong hit of heroin 
2014-10-11 05:56:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was intense 
2014-10-11 07:03:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha wow. I wonder what inspired that?
2014-10-11 07:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And noooo to the sore throat.
2014-10-11 08:12:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then I had a dream where dad bought coke off of a guy in a gorilla suit 
2014-10-11 08:12:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some pretty strange ones over all 
2014-10-11 08:13:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I took some Emergen-C and will make a turmeric tea
2014-10-11 08:13:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So hopefully it'll be ok 
2014-10-11 08:13:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WTF haha. You got drugs on the mind I guess.
2014-10-11 08:13:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe 
2014-10-11 08:13:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can you check the status of my flight.
2014-10-11 08:15:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Flight #9 and #1326 correct?
2014-10-11 08:16:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It looks like you leave Dallas at 9a and get to chicago at 1:25
2014-10-11 08:17:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you at the airport?
2014-10-11 08:17:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The check in people were saying it might get delayed.
2014-10-11 08:17:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your 1st flight?
2014-10-11 08:19:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-10-11 08:20:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh that would suck 
2014-10-11 08:20:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So far so good though
2014-10-11 08:21:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should get the southwest app
2014-10-11 08:21:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hope so. I'd be pretty unhappy if I have to miss the Auburn game.
2014-10-11 08:29:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And see me later?!
2014-10-11 08:32:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Obviously! I need that kickoff blowjob ;)
2014-10-11 08:39:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you boardingggg
2014-10-11 08:42:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In line.
2014-10-11 08:42:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok sweet
2014-10-11 08:42:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should be fine then 
2014-10-11 08:48:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]On the plane. I'll text you when I get to Houston 😘
2014-10-11 08:48:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😽😽😽
2014-10-11 09:57:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Houston!
2014-10-11 09:57:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woo!
2014-10-11 10:37:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It still looks like your next flight gets in at 1:25
2014-10-11 10:37:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes?
2014-10-11 10:37:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm on the plane!
2014-10-11 10:40:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yay! I'll be there like 1:30 waiting at cell phone lot so call when you're at baggage claim 
2014-10-11 10:40:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So excited!
2014-10-11 10:40:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Me too! See you soon :)))))
2014-10-11 13:26:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]At the baggage claim.
2014-10-11 13:32:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Where do I go to get picked up?
2014-10-11 13:33:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I've been picked up from this airport.
2014-10-11 13:39:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hello?
2014-10-14 17:23:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The power cable that's out here doesn't go to the PS3
2014-10-14 17:24:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's no other cable around there?
2014-10-14 17:24:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm it might be in my blue trunk in a nest of other wires. 
2014-10-14 17:24:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No. It almost looks like a PS3 power cable, but it only has two holes instead of three.
2014-10-14 17:25:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll check.
2014-10-14 17:30:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Anywhere else it might be?
2014-10-14 17:32:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In the red bag in the closet by the bathroom?
2014-10-14 17:33:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuck I don't knowww
2014-10-15 09:25:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant to ask you how you felt about things like Santa Claus, the Tooth Fairy, etc.
2014-10-15 11:51:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought about that the other day too, after Charlotte talked about the tooth fairy. I'm kind of torn. Finding out the tooth fairy wasn't real was sort of a traumatic experience for me and my mom.
2014-10-15 11:52:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'd hate to take some of the magic out of my kids childhood 
2014-10-15 12:54:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I read an interesting NY Times piece a couple of years ago on the topic
2014-10-15 12:54:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://roomfordebate.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/22/the-truth-about-santa/?_php=true&_type=blogs&_r=0
2014-10-15 12:54:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just saw this article too, though  http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/12/20/believing-in-santa-healthy_n_4482081.html
2014-10-15 12:54:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I want them to think those things are real
2014-10-15 12:55:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but maybe there's a way you can embrace the imagination aspect of it?
2014-10-15 13:11:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I left the spare battery and the battery charger at your place, but I have no idea where.
2014-10-15 13:11:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*to my camera
2014-10-15 13:27:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol definitely don't even remember this pic of me, you, and Dallas being taken
2014-10-15 13:40:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to see the pics!
2014-10-15 13:40:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm uploading them, it'll proabably be a while still.
2014-10-15 13:40:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There are 382, lol
2014-10-15 13:41:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will you avoid really repetitive ones
2014-10-15 13:41:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pleaseee
2014-10-15 13:41:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For me
2014-10-15 13:41:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you want me to do?
2014-10-15 13:41:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should just let you upload them
2014-10-15 13:41:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you want to do that?
2014-10-15 13:41:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah!
2014-10-15 13:42:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll share all the pics from the weekend with you on Dropbox
2014-10-15 13:42:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]three folders
2014-10-15 13:42:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one of the party
2014-10-15 13:42:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one with the few pics from our dinner date
2014-10-15 13:42:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the scandlous ones
2014-10-15 13:42:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-10-15 13:42:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a lot of the scandalous ones are kinda blurry at full size    😕 
2014-10-15 13:43:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was more about the experience anyway I guess
2014-10-15 13:43:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the ones of you lying down still look good
2014-10-15 13:43:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We probably had shaky hands 
2014-10-15 13:43:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably part of it, but a lot of it probably had to do with the lack of flash and it being dark
2014-10-15 13:43:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-10-15 13:44:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Want me to post through your FB and Google plus, or just post on mine 
2014-10-15 13:45:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm putting them on my G+ right now just so it'll make some gifs out of the burst sequences
2014-10-15 13:45:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like of Dave (David?) thrusting at the camera
2014-10-15 13:45:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yess
2014-10-15 13:45:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dave
2014-10-15 13:47:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually don't think I have enough room on my Dropbox so I'll share them with you through my Google Drive
2014-10-15 13:48:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-10-15 13:52:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The party theme is land of the lost: lost in space, lost in time, lost dignity 
2014-10-15 13:53:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there was a revolt?
2014-10-15 13:53:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The planning committee couldn't think of decoration ideas that weren't offensive 
2014-10-15 13:54:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And no one who supported that theme wanted to be on the committee
2014-10-15 13:54:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we combined the 2nd and 3rd place options and threw in the "lost dignity" comment

2014-10-15 13:55:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha beggars can't be choosers
2014-10-15 13:56:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Brett also told this 1st year girl she couldn't be a DJ BC the spots were full. Aka their "old boys club" won't let anyone else in 
2014-10-15 13:56:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we're going to try to fix that
2014-10-15 13:57:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting

2014-10-15 14:00:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless you want me to pay for an uber?
2014-10-15 14:00:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could probably just do public transit
2014-10-15 14:01:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aw, I want to see you as soon as possible though 
2014-10-15 14:01:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃

2014-10-15 14:02:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I'd feel bad leaving if no one comes to decorate 
2014-10-15 14:02:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which apparently was an issue last year 
2014-10-15 14:02:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really?
2014-10-15 14:02:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sucks
2014-10-15 14:02:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we had so many people help Tim's year
2014-10-15 14:03:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah they mentioned how involvement has been dropping in past years. But maybe this new cohort will be a little more involved 
2014-10-15 14:04:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They already seem to be stepping up more than my year did 
2014-10-15 14:04:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word

2014-10-15 14:08:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I dunno
2014-10-15 14:08:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I'm not good at this
2014-10-15 14:08:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm reasonably creative
2014-10-15 14:08:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but maybe I'm just not all that jazzed about getting dressed up?
2014-10-15 14:09:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love costumes 
2014-10-15 14:09:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're so fun
2014-10-15 14:09:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'll let you take charge then
2014-10-15 14:09:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's fine if you decide you'd rather not do a couples thing
2014-10-15 14:10:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if you have a good idea, let me know 
2014-10-15 14:10:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK I will
2014-10-15 14:38:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't use SnapSaved, right?
2014-10-15 14:38:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no

2014-10-15 15:40:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wanna buy my Orlando ticket now. At least the one there 
2014-10-15 15:40:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm getting nervous 
2014-10-15 15:40:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Go ahead.
2014-10-15 15:41:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let me know when you hear about your final
2014-10-15 15:41:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I say you should come to chicago before if you can 
2014-10-15 15:44:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK I'll email the professor when I get home, but I think she's at a conference this week.
2014-10-15 16:11:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude. Don't touch anything at the airport when you fly.
2014-10-15 16:11:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wear a face mask
2014-10-15 16:11:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not kidding
2014-10-15 16:19:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]More Ebola?
2014-10-15 16:19:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-10-15 16:19:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On a frontier flight into Dallas
2014-10-15 16:20:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Pretty crazy. You have to come into contact with fluids, though, right?
2014-10-15 16:21:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was one of the nurses involved in treating the guy who died 
2014-10-15 16:21:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why the fuck are they allowed to fly
2014-10-15 16:21:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sounds like they shouldn't have been.
2014-10-15 16:22:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it is just bodily fluids
2014-10-15 16:22:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But still, don't touch anything
2014-10-15 16:22:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And wash your hands 
2014-10-15 16:23:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I'll try to avoid hooking up with any nurses exhibiting flu-like symptoms mid-flight
2014-10-15 16:24:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well what if they accidentally cut their finger and then open a door handle! 
2014-10-15 16:27:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll be careful. I expect you to marry me if I get Ebola, though.
2014-10-15 16:28:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Looks like they have a pretty effective cure
2014-10-15 16:28:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll probably be ok
2014-10-15 16:29:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh really? I thought the mortality rate was still pretty high.
2014-10-15 16:29:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.cleveland.com/healthfit/index.ssf/2014/10/ebola_q_a_what_you_should_know_now_that_cleveland_is_linked_to_deadly_virus.html
2014-10-15 16:29:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]experimental, but it's cured 2 ppl and 18 monkeys
2014-10-15 16:31:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I marry you, we wouldn't be able to consummate it
2014-10-15 16:31:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]unless you want me to die with you ala Romeo and Juliet
2014-10-15 16:33:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We can just video, right?

2014-10-15 16:38:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't force youuu
2014-10-15 17:05:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mom totally expected an engagement announcement btw

2014-10-15 23:56:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"

2014-10-16 00:07:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so in case the other gets a shitty spot they can save a seat
2014-10-16 00:08:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word that makes sense.
2014-10-16 00:09:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sooooo many points

2014-10-16 00:12:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think my dad covered Dylan and Emily's honeymoon?
2014-10-16 00:13:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or at least part of it
2014-10-16 00:13:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to Hawai'i
2014-10-16 00:13:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I
2014-10-16 00:13:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never been to Hawaii
2014-10-16 00:13:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're actually taking their honeymoon after Christmas I think
2014-10-16 00:13:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was put on delay
2014-10-16 00:13:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]thanks to a certain munchkin

2014-10-16 00:14:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where would you want to go?
2014-10-16 00:14:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A secluded beach where we could be naked all day would be cool
2014-10-16 00:14:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-16 00:14:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much
2014-10-16 00:15:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]is that too cliched?
2014-10-16 00:15:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't think so!
2014-10-16 00:15:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't know if you wanted something more relaxed and romantic or more adventurous
2014-10-16 00:15:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want a little bit of both?
2014-10-16 00:16:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-16 00:16:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like a day of hiking something awesome follwed by a day of naked frolicking 
2014-10-16 00:16:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but maybe not somewhere where I'd want to explore the culture a lot
2014-10-16 00:16:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]those kinds of trips would be better just as vacations
2014-10-16 00:17:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-10-16 00:20:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]THere we go, jumping ahead of ourselves again
2014-10-16 00:22:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I know.
2014-10-16 00:22:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's just so easy to get excited about.
2014-10-16 00:25:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Talking to my mom about it was kinda frustrating
2014-10-16 00:25:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I almost wanted to tell her that of course we're going to get engaged, just not right this second
2014-10-16 00:27:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It was frustrating because you couldn't say that?
2014-10-16 00:28:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe not frustrating
2014-10-16 00:29:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but it felt silly to tell her "no we aren't going to get married"
2014-10-16 00:29:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"right now"
2014-10-16 00:29:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]even though we've talked about it so much
2014-10-16 00:30:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha yeah that is kinda silly I guess.
2014-10-16 00:31:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Alright, beautiful. I'm gonna get some sleep. I love you so much and I really miss sleeping in the same bed as you.
2014-10-16 00:31:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I'm crashing too
2014-10-16 00:31:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you so much, but tomorrow it will only be ike 8 days away!
2014-10-16 00:32:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yayyy!
2014-10-16 07:14:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I forgot to tell you, Colin and alice broke up
2014-10-16 07:14:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Apparently as they started looking for jobs/postdocs, one of them really wanted to make things work and the other was iffy about it 
2014-10-16 08:33:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wow. No kidding.
2014-10-16 08:37:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I guess neither of them are really even staying at their apt right now
2014-10-16 08:38:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was about to say. That has to be awkward.
2014-10-16 08:38:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like that had to be a pretty big surprise for the one who wanted to make it work.
2014-10-16 08:38:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They've invested a lot of time in it at this point.
2014-10-16 08:38:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]According to Haley (where I'm getting most of this info), it's been building up for a while 
2014-10-16 08:39:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or maybe they had talked about it in the beginning
2014-10-16 08:40:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well hopefully they're both able to move on and not feel down about it for too long
2014-10-16 08:42:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-10-16 09:15:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The GRFP is due in less than 3 weeks 
2014-10-16 09:15:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fuckkkk
2014-10-16 09:16:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I gotta have a solid draft done before you get here, because this pop genomics guy is gonna go over it with me on the 28
2014-10-16 09:16:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]better get crackin'!
2014-10-16 09:19:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have a feeling we're both gonna get pretty busy after this next visit
2014-10-16 09:19:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and probably maintain it until Christmas
2014-10-16 09:20:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-10-16 09:21:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'll make breaks between visits faster though 
2014-10-16 09:21:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's true
2014-10-16 09:21:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can practice our productive couch cuddling techniques 
2014-10-16 09:21:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds good
2014-10-16 09:22:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the longest gap we have for the rest of 2014 is 16 days
2014-10-16 09:22:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth?
2014-10-16 09:23:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Between Halloween and the early nov visit?
2014-10-16 09:23:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep
2014-10-16 09:23:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's when I'll probably be shutting myself up in the office 
2014-10-16 09:24:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah that'll probably be good for both of us
2014-10-16 09:24:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll need to make progress on my NLP and Deep Learning projects
2014-10-16 12:21:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm gonna go to glitch mob tomorrow with Dallas and Priya's roommat

2014-10-16 17:11:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There's a shadow of that memory, and that would definitely cause that kind of reaction from me.
2014-10-16 17:18:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha maybe, I don't remember the specifics either 
2014-10-16 18:19:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was the only person in TA class called out by name for something I did well 
2014-10-16 18:19:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm so proud    😃 
2014-10-16 18:19:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what'd you do well?

2014-10-16 18:22:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which is something I've never experienced with public speaking 
2014-10-16 18:22:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from the 30 seconds I saw you seemed engaging

2014-10-16 18:28:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nooo you don't have to have a PhD to teach 
2014-10-16 18:28:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't?
2014-10-16 18:29:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You probs wouldn't be paid as much, but you could be like a business professor who just lectures at night a couple nights a week after his job if you wanted 
2014-10-16 18:30:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ain't no way I'm ever gonna do that

2014-10-17 09:49:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too... soooo much
2014-10-17 10:22:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just got a SWEET deal on a Nexus 5.
2014-10-17 10:22:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$200
2014-10-17 10:22:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm having it shipped to your place.
2014-10-17 10:52:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice!
2014-10-17 10:52:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do I have to sign for it?
2014-10-17 10:53:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]uh it's gonna be USPS
2014-10-17 10:53:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool
2014-10-17 10:53:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll look out for it
2014-10-17 10:53:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awesome
2014-10-17 10:53:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pumped
2014-10-17 10:53:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A working phone!
2014-10-17 10:53:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's gonna be such a huge upgrade
2014-10-17 10:53:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]eBay?
2014-10-17 10:53:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-17 10:53:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Swappa
2014-10-17 10:54:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So if it's fucked up somehow you can return it or w/e?
2014-10-17 10:54:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-17 10:54:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or there's a warranty?
2014-10-17 10:54:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no warranty, but you can return it
2014-10-17 10:54:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the dude has sold several devices, though
2014-10-17 10:54:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and all the buyers gave him good reviews
2014-10-17 10:54:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe he steals them 
2014-10-17 10:54:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it should be good
2014-10-17 10:54:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe
2014-10-17 10:56:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, at the end of Sophie's defense I almost tested up, and at the end of krinsky's a fucking tear actually escaped 
2014-10-17 10:56:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wtf is wrong with me?
2014-10-17 10:57:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-17 10:57:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you get emotional at big moments?
2014-10-17 10:57:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not weird
2014-10-17 10:57:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't need to be physically emotional though
2014-10-17 10:58:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wasn't even that close to sofie
2014-10-17 10:58:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]people get emotional in movies and shit, though and those characters aren't even real
2014-10-17 10:59:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I gotta become a lot more cynical before my defense 
2014-10-17 10:59:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh... you're definitely gonna cry at the end
2014-10-17 11:00:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you seen ppl cry?
2014-10-17 11:00:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Daniel Matute got really emotional
2014-10-17 11:00:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think he full out cried
2014-10-17 11:00:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but his voice was breaking when he was thanking Kacy
2014-10-17 11:00:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was a pretty sweet moment
2014-10-17 11:00:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I am unable to produce sound when I get emotional 
2014-10-17 11:01:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just won't thank anyone 
2014-10-17 11:01:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that'd probably mitigate it
2014-10-17 11:01:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You and my parents aren't allowed to come 
2014-10-17 11:01:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-17 11:01:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Daniel maybe 
2014-10-17 11:01:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But he might cry 
2014-10-17 11:02:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can all watch it on video from the other room 
2014-10-17 11:02:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-10-17 11:02:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I honestly wouldn't be offeneded
2014-10-17 11:03:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's why I love you 
2014-10-17 11:51:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you help me figure out why this code won't work when you have a chance
2014-10-17 11:51:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]https://github.com/ksil91/Bioinformatics/tree/master
2014-10-17 11:51:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like it's probably pretty dumb
2014-10-17 12:17:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I'll take a look at it.
2014-10-17 12:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's not working about it?
2014-10-17 12:22:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The count is always 0
2014-10-17 12:23:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When it shouldn't be
2014-10-17 12:32:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. I can't test it right now, but your for loop is wrong and you don't need to subtract one from the pattern length.
2014-10-17 12:33:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How is it wrong?
2014-10-17 12:34:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The bad for loop is what's causing the zero count I'm pretty sure, though. You just might over count with the wrong pattern length.
2014-10-17 12:34:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you want me to tell you or do you want to try to figure it out yourself?
2014-10-17 12:34:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Try printing that range in the terminal.
2014-10-17 12:36:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The reason I subtracted 1 is bc the way I'm indexing it, it was a character too short
2014-10-17 12:38:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The second index occurs after the last character when you use that syntax.
2014-10-17 12:39:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So string[0:4] includes characters indexed by 0 to 3.
2014-10-17 12:41:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I printed the range in the terminal 
2014-10-17 12:46:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK it's right.
2014-10-17 12:47:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Your pattern and text might have newline characters.
2014-10-17 12:47:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I printed them though
2014-10-17 12:47:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just type pattern into the console and see what it looks like
2014-10-17 12:47:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Don't print
2014-10-17 12:49:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-10-17 12:49:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It does
2014-10-17 12:51:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK do .readline().strip()
2014-10-17 12:52:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-10-17 12:54:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is my for loop still wrong?
2014-10-17 12:54:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No. I misinterpreted it.
2014-10-17 12:55:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's still not working, even with strip
2014-10-17 12:55:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Got it
2014-10-17 12:55:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks!
2014-10-17 12:56:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What was it?
2014-10-17 12:56:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The is?
2014-10-17 12:56:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-10-17 12:57:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had == initially but thought that was the issue 
2014-10-17 16:31:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so did you end up removing the -1 from your code?
2014-10-17 16:33:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you must've if it was working
2014-10-17 17:27:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-10-17 17:35:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I worked through some of the later Rosalind problems now and think my Python is a little more sturdy 
2014-10-17 17:36:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really wanted to just do the algorithm in R, but that wouldn't be helpful in the long run 
2014-10-17 17:37:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]string manipulations are way easier in Python
2014-10-17 17:39:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whoa, this Rosalind website is comprehensive
2014-10-17 17:39:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's cool, right? And it doesnt just give you answers it makes you look up the functions and stuff you need 
2014-10-17 17:41:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is this website tied to the Bioinformatics course?
2014-10-17 17:41:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems similar in structure and implementation
2014-10-17 17:41:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's made be the same ppl 
2014-10-17 17:41:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, makes sense
2014-10-17 17:41:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-10-17 17:41:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is totally awesome of them
2014-10-17 17:41:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bravo
2014-10-17 17:41:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Rosalind has been around longer though maybe 
2014-10-17 17:41:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I heard about it last sept
2014-10-17 17:42:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-17 17:43:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made some progress on my GRFP today too
2014-10-17 17:43:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice, that's good
2014-10-17 17:43:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And had some ideas about what to do next with my data 
2014-10-17 17:44:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which makes me feel like oysters might be the dissertation after all
2014-10-17 17:44:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah? Well that's cool.
2014-10-17 17:45:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure 
2014-10-17 17:46:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I always imagined I'd work on something a little more charismatic, but I guess I have the rest of my career to do that
2014-10-17 17:46:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like what?
2014-10-17 17:47:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Coral was what got me interested in marine biology in the 1st place 
2014-10-17 17:47:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But there are a ton of ppl doing this stuff on coral 
2014-10-17 17:47:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And oysters have a lot of similar properties as far as being ecosystem engineers
2014-10-17 17:48:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They just aren't as pretty lol
2014-10-17 17:49:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah, well I guess you can always check out other systems later
2014-10-17 17:49:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like you said
2014-10-17 17:49:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd imagine your skills will be pretty transferable
2014-10-17 17:52:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For sure 
2014-10-17 17:53:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The molecular and bioinformatics are definitely broadly applicable 
2014-10-17 17:53:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And any experimental work would just show I'm good at designing an experimental system without an advisor who specializes in that
2014-10-17 17:54:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep
2014-10-17 17:54:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're gonna be great    😃 
2014-10-17 17:54:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]☺️
2014-10-17 17:55:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking today about how there are several people in the program who are from the area
2014-10-17 17:55:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like a few hours drive
2014-10-17 17:56:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I was thinking that would make me more likely to do a PhD if my life had gone that way
2014-10-17 17:57:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if there's a place to get pizza near me
2014-10-17 17:58:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]From Dallas?
2014-10-17 17:58:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or Chicago?
2014-10-17 17:58:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Chicago
2014-10-17 17:58:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's true for Dallas too
2014-10-17 17:59:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You would've been more likely to do a PhD in your home town?
2014-10-17 17:59:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think all of the American PhD students here I've met are from Texas at the least
2014-10-17 17:59:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not necessarily in the hometown
2014-10-17 17:59:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but like a few hours away
2014-10-17 18:00:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I would feel less like I was wasting my life
2014-10-17 18:00:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's hard for me to justify no income/no family time
2014-10-17 18:00:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and no income prospects for several years
2014-10-17 18:01:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just thinking about things I think would've influenced decisions I've made in the past knowing what I know now
2014-10-17 18:06:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kind of a fruitless thought process in my opinion 
2014-10-17 18:06:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since it seems like you're really happy you've moved away from biology
2014-10-17 18:06:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not referring to biology at this point
2014-10-17 18:07:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the shit we're going over in this Deep Learning/Statistical Relational Learning is super interesting
2014-10-17 18:07:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I just think it's completely ridiculous that I'd have to sacrifice five years of scraping by in my prime to do a PhD
2014-10-17 20:39:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On my way to the shoe 
2014-10-17 20:39:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*show
2014-10-17 20:39:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'll talk to you later 
2014-10-17 20:39:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!
2014-10-17 23:06:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Mwah!
2014-10-18 01:19:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You still awake?
2014-10-18 10:42:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Snugglesssssss
2014-10-18 10:43:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kisssssessss
2014-10-18 10:43:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-18 10:43:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tittttttyyy masssssaaaaagggesss
2014-10-18 10:44:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're a goofball
2014-10-18 10:44:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good morning 
2014-10-18 10:44:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to?
2014-10-18 10:45:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]working on my deep learning project
2014-10-18 10:45:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the names associated with the paintings don't match 100% with the names I pulled for the different movements
2014-10-18 10:45:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like they use non Latin characters
2014-10-18 10:45:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or they have slightly different spellings
2014-10-18 10:46:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or other minor differences
2014-10-18 10:46:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm manually going through them
2014-10-18 10:46:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty tedious
2014-10-18 10:46:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh
2014-10-18 10:46:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like "baldassare d' este"
2014-10-18 10:46:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and "baldassare d' este"
2014-10-18 10:46:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are the same person
2014-10-18 10:46:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should email them again, tell them they're sloppy data managers
2014-10-18 10:47:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this isn't their fault
2014-10-18 10:47:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm merging two disparate datasets
2014-10-18 10:47:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh ok
2014-10-18 10:47:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those are the same spellings though, aren't they?
2014-10-18 10:48:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I get what you mean
2014-10-18 10:48:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"baldassare estense"
2014-10-18 10:49:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty proud of this little pipeline I've built, though
2014-10-18 10:49:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've had to pull/clean a lot of data
2014-10-18 10:49:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The pipeline is for pulling the data?
2014-10-18 10:50:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I had to download all those images
2014-10-18 10:50:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then I had to pull info from a different website that associates artists with different movements
2014-10-18 10:50:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and now I'm merging those two data sets
2014-10-18 10:52:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's something I wouldn't have even been able to think about doing a couple of years ago
2014-10-18 10:53:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's pretty cool
2014-10-18 10:53:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What helped you learn how to do that? 
2014-10-18 10:53:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like a specific class/mooc or just general learning 
2014-10-18 10:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I learned about "scraping" for a MOOC, but the MOOC didn't require it
2014-10-18 10:54:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was for the NFL social network I did
2014-10-18 10:54:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and this involves a lot of scraping
2014-10-18 10:55:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the program I'm doing to match names uses an algorithm I probably wouldn't have known about without learning algorithms
2014-10-18 10:56:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's a min-edit distance thing
2014-10-18 10:56:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it makes it pretty quick
2014-10-18 10:56:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all on the engineering side I'd say, though
2014-10-18 10:56:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the actual analysis will be on the Deep Learning side
2014-10-18 10:57:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was your night?
2014-10-18 10:57:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was fun 
2014-10-18 10:58:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Glitch Mob and M Machine were really good live 
2014-10-18 10:58:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish you were there! 
2014-10-18 10:59:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we'll definitely see a show in that venue sometime 
2014-10-18 10:59:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was cool?
2014-10-18 11:00:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They have galaxies painted in the ceiling 
2014-10-18 11:00:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With little lights for stars scattered throughout
2014-10-18 11:00:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the stage is pretty visible no matter where you stand 
2014-10-18 11:01:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made out with a girl who was by us for the show lol 
2014-10-18 11:01:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, she made out with me and I reciprocated
2014-10-18 11:03:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah?
2014-10-18 11:03:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how'd that happen?
2014-10-18 11:04:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We had talked with them a little before the show, and then we were dancing together and she went for it 
2014-10-18 11:05:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]were y'all on anything?
2014-10-18 11:05:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I decided to take a roll 
2014-10-18 11:05:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I probably should've given those to you lol
2014-10-18 11:06:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She was rolling too
2014-10-18 11:15:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess Miami has a by this week too
2014-10-18 11:19:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what was the makeout situation?
2014-10-18 11:19:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]y'all were just going at it on the dancefloor?
2014-10-18 11:19:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It lasted like maybe 5 seconds 
2014-10-18 11:20:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so grinding -> makeout
2014-10-18 11:20:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It wasn't really grinding, it was dancing closely 
2014-10-18 11:20:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you unhappy about it?
2014-10-18 11:21:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just trying to get the details
2014-10-18 11:21:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There was a little butt grabbing 
2014-10-18 11:23:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's a trauma counselor for some hospital 
2014-10-18 11:23:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably a couple years older than me
2014-10-18 11:23:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Had brown hair 
2014-10-18 11:34:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alison Anastasio said we were the cutest couple ever as per facebook stalking 
2014-10-18 11:36:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-10-18 11:37:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I see you in less than a week!
2014-10-18 11:38:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hooray!
2014-10-18 11:39:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And since adam is also in charge of decorating the Atlantis room, he said that if we're still busy at 10p he can cover the rest of it
2014-10-18 11:39:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'll pick you up :)
2014-10-18 11:39:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We have to get the kegs on Saturday though 
2014-10-18 11:40:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's nice of him
2014-10-18 11:41:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He's been getting super involved in the Halloween stuff, which isn't usually like him. I feel like he might be trying to distract himself? 
2014-10-18 11:41:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can only imagine how I'd feel if Elin died
2014-10-18 11:42:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah. I forgot he said it was his best friend that died.
2014-10-18 11:42:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That would suck.
2014-10-18 11:42:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-10-18 11:43:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you do anything else last night/
2014-10-18 11:43:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I just drove home after the show 
2014-10-18 11:44:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which was slightly more stressful than I expected  
2014-10-18 11:44:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And smoked a bowl and took a shower and cuddled with Flo
2014-10-18 11:44:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why was the drive stressful
2014-10-18 11:45:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just paranoid about getting pulled over with giant pupils
2014-10-18 11:46:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Darcy actually went to chromeo across the street at the riviera and said she would drive home, but their show got out 2 hours before mine 
2014-10-18 11:46:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bummer
2014-10-18 11:47:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was this chick threesome material?
2014-10-18 11:47:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I dunno. I was attracted to her, and she was clearly attracted to me
2014-10-18 11:49:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But she had a friend/boyfriend there, so I don't really know if she's the type to just join a random couple 
2014-10-18 11:49:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some girls just like to kiss other girls when they're rolling 
2014-10-18 11:50:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm assuming the odds of a girl participating in a threesome go up if they are making out with another chick
2014-10-18 11:51:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably 
2014-10-18 11:52:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't want to pick up a girl from a show like that though 
2014-10-18 11:52:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would feel creepy 
2014-10-18 11:52:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why?
2014-10-18 11:53:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Once at ultra I was dancing with this girl a little and her boyfriend asked me to go home with them and it felt creepy to me
2014-10-18 11:54:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more creepy than a guy asking a girl to go home with him?
2014-10-18 11:54:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like in my mind at the time, just dancing with a stranger was a biggg jump from wanting to get in bed with her and her boyfriend 
2014-10-18 11:54:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I wasn't dancing with the guy 
2014-10-18 11:54:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was dancing with her 
2014-10-18 11:54:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-18 11:54:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you didn't make out with her?
2014-10-18 11:54:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cheek kisses I think 
2014-10-18 11:55:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's a big jump
2014-10-18 11:55:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This was like sophomore year too
2014-10-18 11:55:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I was 20 lol
2014-10-18 11:55:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it's creepy to ask a girl you're making out with to go home with you
2014-10-18 11:55:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what?
2014-10-18 11:55:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when has age ever stopped your sexual escapades haha
2014-10-18 11:55:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I guess if she had asked me it would've felt less creepy you know 
2014-10-18 11:56:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude 
2014-10-18 11:56:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't like you implicitly making fun of how old I was when I lost my virginity or w/e
2014-10-18 11:57:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why?
2014-10-18 11:57:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's not any one act
2014-10-18 11:57:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm referring to
2014-10-18 11:57:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you retain nothing of our conversation the other night? How I was bullied about the sexual things I did in high school?
2014-10-18 11:58:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not bullying you, though
2014-10-18 11:58:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why would your age matter
2014-10-18 11:58:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're making fun of me for a slightly sensitive subject 
2014-10-18 11:58:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not "making fun"
2014-10-18 11:58:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm making a joke about the age thing
2014-10-18 11:59:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At 20, I was not really into the whole 'going home with a stranger' thing 
2014-10-18 11:59:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still really am not now
2014-10-18 12:00:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you take my sex history with significant others and extrapolate 
2014-10-18 12:00:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-10-18 12:00:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]K
2014-10-18 12:00:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure what I'm extrapolating in this case
2014-10-18 12:01:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That because I've had lots of 'sexual escapades' why wouldn't I want to go home with someone?
2014-10-18 12:01:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why would your age matter
2014-10-18 12:01:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was the joke
2014-10-18 12:02:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because I was certainly less likely to go home with someone then than I am now 
2014-10-18 12:03:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't realize your opinion on going home had changed with your age
2014-10-18 12:03:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or since you were 20 I guess
2014-10-18 12:04:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It hasn't changed significantly, but you didn't know me when I was 20 so I guess I can't blame you for just assuming I was a wilder version of who I am now
2014-10-18 12:04:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In some ways maybe I was
2014-10-18 12:04:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anyways 
2014-10-18 12:05:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so who would you have a threesome with then?
2014-10-18 12:05:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right now? Like with you?
2014-10-18 12:05:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess?
2014-10-18 12:06:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in general works too?
2014-10-18 12:06:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've said girl you make out with at show is a no go
2014-10-18 12:06:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm wondering who is fine
2014-10-18 12:07:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, I think I'd almost rather find someone on ok Cupid. 
2014-10-18 12:07:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-18 12:08:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't really want to have one anytime soon though 
2014-10-18 12:08:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh 
2014-10-18 12:08:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-18 12:09:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Certainly not while we're long distance 
2014-10-18 12:09:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see
2014-10-18 12:09:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you really want to have one now or something?
2014-10-18 12:10:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm interested?
2014-10-18 12:10:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I was just going off of you making out with girls
2014-10-18 12:12:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well maybe we'll go to a show together sometime and it'll happen again and you can watch lol
2014-10-18 12:12:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]boring
2014-10-18 12:13:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I can participate?
2014-10-18 12:13:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just not quite ready to bring someone else into our bedroom when we spend the majority of the time apart 
2014-10-18 12:13:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The reason a girl is making out with a girl is because she doesn't want to kiss a strange dude 
2014-10-18 12:14:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can I find a girl who will make out with a strange dude then?
2014-10-18 12:14:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I don't really understand that logic
2014-10-18 12:14:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like why I like to dance with gay men 
2014-10-18 12:15:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except it's not the same?
2014-10-18 12:15:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just want to dance, and They won't try to take me home at the end of the night 
2014-10-18 12:15:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so this is just wanting to make out
2014-10-18 12:15:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes, and on Molly people aren't usually very sexual anyways 
2014-10-18 12:16:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess as long as I can make out with girls I'm cool with it
2014-10-18 12:16:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go ahead 
2014-10-18 12:16:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet!
2014-10-18 12:16:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can I actively seek out attractive girls at shows/
2014-10-18 12:16:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure 
2014-10-18 12:16:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-10-18 12:17:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I already told you I think you should hook up with other people 
2014-10-18 12:17:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like take girls home?
2014-10-18 12:17:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't care what you do 
2014-10-18 12:17:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-10-18 12:17:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good
2014-10-18 12:17:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just don't get an std
2014-10-18 12:17:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK I'll try not to
2014-10-18 12:18:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I can also make out with random dudes? 
2014-10-18 12:18:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-18 12:18:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but why would you want to do that
2014-10-18 12:18:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they are strange
2014-10-18 12:18:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-10-18 12:18:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you can go home with them too
2014-10-18 12:19:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just don't get an STD
2014-10-18 12:19:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-18 12:19:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why does this kind of shit always have to get so poisonous with you 
2014-10-18 12:19:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how am I being poisonous?
2014-10-18 12:19:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what have I said?
2014-10-18 12:20:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You said a long time ago you didn't mind if I made out with a girl 
2014-10-18 12:21:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Plutonically 
2014-10-18 12:21:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what
2014-10-18 12:21:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And now you're taking it to mean you should be able to make out with other girls 
2014-10-18 12:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is plutonically
2014-10-18 12:22:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You even said yourself that you wouldn't mind if I hooked up with a girl but would get really upset if I hooked up with a dude, that those 2 situations are different in your mind even though they logically aren't
2014-10-18 12:23:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Platonically (with no desire to go past that)
2014-10-18 12:23:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]platonic is non-sexual
2014-10-18 12:24:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This was not really sexual. I did not want to have sex with her, I wasn't horny because of it, it was just fun 
2014-10-18 12:24:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And so now you're saying if I kiss a girl at a show, you should Be able to kiss a girl 
2014-10-18 12:24:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because you definitely won't get an erection from that 
2014-10-18 12:25:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not if I'm rolling?
2014-10-18 12:25:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]should we have an only rolling rule?
2014-10-18 12:25:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are your rules currently?
2014-10-18 12:25:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you were grabbing asses
2014-10-18 12:25:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you "weren't horny"?
2014-10-18 12:25:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much is OK?
2014-10-18 12:25:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you don't want it to happen again, I won't do it 
2014-10-18 12:25:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]way to avoid the questoin
2014-10-18 12:25:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-10-18 12:26:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought we weren't going to have these conversations over text 
2014-10-18 12:26:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]K
2014-10-18 12:27:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't do this anymore, I can't feel shitty every time I go out. I don't want to talk to you until next Friday. 
2014-10-18 12:28:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]such a hypocrite
2014-10-18 12:28:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so defensive
2014-10-18 12:28:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but whatever
2014-10-18 12:28:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't care
2014-10-18 12:28:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're mean and you don't even realize it 
2014-10-18 12:29:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't fucking been mean
2014-10-18 12:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seriously
2014-10-18 12:29:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like look at what I've said
2014-10-18 12:29:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's been you getting defensive
2014-10-18 12:30:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because you contradict yourself
2014-10-18 12:30:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I point it out
2014-10-18 12:31:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fine it's my fault for being contradictory , and going off of something you said (that was contradictory) months ago 
2014-10-18 12:31:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-10-18 12:31:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have I told you what you did last night was wrong?
2014-10-18 12:32:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've said that if I do it you can do it 
2014-10-18 12:32:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which feels punitive 
2014-10-18 12:32:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think we ever established what I can do
2014-10-18 12:33:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and this is the first time you've actually acted on this impulse
2014-10-18 12:33:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as far as I know
2014-10-18 12:33:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so wouldn't it make sense to discuss the finer details
2014-10-18 12:33:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm an asshole
2014-10-18 12:33:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and just trying to punish you
2014-10-18 12:33:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]obviously
2014-10-18 12:33:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]See, that right there is poisonous 
2014-10-18 12:33:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-18 12:34:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]saying you don't want to talk to me until you see me is poisonous
2014-10-18 12:35:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]should we be talking about this on the phone?
2014-10-18 12:35:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can call if you want 
2014-10-18 12:35:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you prefer it this way though so you can throw my words back at me more effectively 
2014-10-18 12:36:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol I'm CLEARLY the poisonous one
2014-10-18 12:36:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you deny doing that?
2014-10-18 12:38:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the first two were jokes
2014-10-18 12:38:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but legitimate
2014-10-18 12:38:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was a funny way to say the rules
2014-10-18 12:38:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]since you had already said them
2014-10-18 12:38:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the last one was a legitimate point
2014-10-18 12:38:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm clearly not finding any of this funny 
2014-10-18 12:39:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know because you are bipolar when it comes to your sexuality
2014-10-18 12:39:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you could try being understanding about it instead of pushing and pushing me 
2014-10-18 12:40:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is there to understand?
2014-10-18 12:40:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what am I missing?
2014-10-18 12:41:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just tell me what you want the rules to be
2014-10-18 12:41:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No passive aggressive bullshit from either of us anymore 
2014-10-18 12:41:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just say what would and would not make you happy 
2014-10-18 12:41:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Please
2014-10-18 12:42:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you should give me your rules
2014-10-18 12:43:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't care 
2014-10-18 12:43:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't care if I never kiss another person but you again 
2014-10-18 12:43:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you seem to care 
2014-10-18 12:43:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So please, tell me how you'd like to proceed 
2014-10-18 12:43:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-10-18 12:44:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wtf are you talking about
2014-10-18 12:44:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]YOU are the one who kissed another person last night

2014-10-18 12:44:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kissed someone because I thought you were ok with it 
2014-10-18 12:45:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you want kissing girls to be allowed
2014-10-18 12:45:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what else?
2014-10-18 12:45:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was following your ruled 
2014-10-18 12:45:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]kissing girls for you
2014-10-18 12:45:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not for me?
2014-10-18 12:46:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you want to kiss other girls?
2014-10-18 12:46:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're establishing your rules right now
2014-10-18 12:46:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what would be the ideal rules for you
2014-10-18 12:47:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you knew I would 100% be down
2014-10-18 12:47:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to tell you what I think and have it torn down by you, or worse have you accept it but be bitter about it. 
2014-10-18 12:48:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do not care enough about this situation for either to happen 
2014-10-18 12:48:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I won't accept it if I don't agree with it
2014-10-18 12:48:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I won't tear it down
2014-10-18 12:48:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No kissing anyone else 
2014-10-18 12:49:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless the other person is there and is ok with it 
2014-10-18 12:49:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that really an ideal rule for you?
2014-10-18 12:51:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-10-18 12:52:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK, I'm not cutting you dwon
2014-10-18 12:52:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but do you understand why that's hard for me to believe
2014-10-18 12:52:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because I'm a slut?
2014-10-18 12:52:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because you made out with a girl last night
2014-10-18 12:52:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if your own rule
2014-10-18 12:52:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was more strict
2014-10-18 12:52:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I regret that decision 
2014-10-18 12:52:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]than my rule
2014-10-18 12:53:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I changed my rules
2014-10-18 12:53:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you regret it because it caused this conversation?
2014-10-18 12:53:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-10-18 12:53:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not an ideal rule then
2014-10-18 12:53:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fuck it
2014-10-18 12:53:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no rules
2014-10-18 12:54:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you're not going to try and be honest with me there's no point
2014-10-18 12:54:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm just trying to make you happy and failing miserably 
2014-10-18 12:54:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'd make me happy if you were honest
2014-10-18 12:56:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What did you mean when you said I was bipolar about my sexuality?
2014-10-18 12:58:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you do shit and then you feel shameful about it
2014-10-18 12:58:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you like want to give off this persona of promiscuity
2014-10-18 12:58:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or sexual openness
2014-10-18 12:58:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then you are defensive about it
2014-10-18 12:59:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't feel shameful until I started talking to you about it 
2014-10-18 12:59:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that counts as feeling shameful?
2014-10-18 12:59:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you were defensive
2014-10-18 13:00:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You put me on the defensive. My perceived notion about how you view this kind of activity makes me feel judged
2014-10-18 13:00:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well what rules do you want then
2014-10-18 13:00:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]without being judged?
2014-10-18 13:02:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can make out with people every once in a while. No crotch touching. 
2014-10-18 13:03:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]male and female?
2014-10-18 13:03:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just female 
2014-10-18 13:03:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tits and ass are OK?
2014-10-18 13:04:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure
2014-10-18 13:04:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sucking on titties?
2014-10-18 13:04:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-10-18 13:04:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not gonna take anyone he 
2014-10-18 13:04:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*home
2014-10-18 13:04:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]could happen without going home
2014-10-18 13:05:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd rather not suck on a persons titties on public it's not my style 
2014-10-18 13:05:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-18 13:05:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so making out and playing with ass/titties
2014-10-18 13:05:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with females
2014-10-18 13:06:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are my rules
2014-10-18 13:07:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't care what you do, but I'd rather you not do anything out of spite. And I'd rather you didn't tell me if you took someone else home.
2014-10-18 13:07:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless you fall in love with them
2014-10-18 13:08:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you really don't care what I do?
2014-10-18 13:08:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want you to be happy 
2014-10-18 13:08:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not what this exercise is about
2014-10-18 13:08:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If a situation came up where making out with a girl at the bar made you happy, I'm for it 
2014-10-18 13:08:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't think about me
2014-10-18 13:09:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]think about a relationship in the abstract
2014-10-18 13:09:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and your ideal rules
2014-10-18 13:09:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]These are my rules 
2014-10-18 13:09:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This would not hurt our relationship for me
2014-10-18 13:09:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or how I felt about you 
2014-10-18 13:09:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I slept with another woman?
2014-10-18 13:11:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I said, I don't want all the details. But if you were really attracted to her or something and wanted a one night stand that's ok with me 
2014-10-18 13:11:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've said all this before 
2014-10-18 13:12:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so don't fall in love
2014-10-18 13:12:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it sounds like only one night stands?
2014-10-18 13:12:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or are multiple occurrences OK
2014-10-18 13:12:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can I know the person?
2014-10-18 13:12:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean if you do, then go for it. Maybe you were better with that person anyways and I'm holding you back 
2014-10-18 13:12:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just meant if you fall in love, tell me 
2014-10-18 13:13:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well yeah obviously
2014-10-18 13:13:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That would break my heart pretty bad, but I'm assuming you took that into consideration when you fell in love with the other person 
2014-10-18 13:14:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean you can't really control those things
2014-10-18 13:15:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if you're capable of loving multiple people that way at once that's true, but if you're not then there is some decision making when you choose to develop one relationship more over the other 
2014-10-18 13:16:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Multiple occurrences are fine, but I don't want it to take time away from us 
2014-10-18 13:16:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK so no booty calls
2014-10-18 13:16:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-18 13:16:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't sleep with my friends 
2014-10-18 13:17:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-18 13:19:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cool?
2014-10-18 13:19:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What would your ideal rules be?
2014-10-18 13:19:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]philosophically polyamory
2014-10-18 13:19:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think that would take some serious conditioning, though
2014-10-18 13:21:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'd like to develop our relationship together more before there was any active search for polyamory 
2014-10-18 13:22:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not really an active search
2014-10-18 13:23:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you make decisions to go up to a woman you're friends with and think is pretty cool and attracted to and try to make it something more 
2014-10-18 13:23:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I think of it more as not resisting  something
2014-10-18 13:23:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]rather than actively seeking it out
2014-10-18 13:24:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fair enough
2014-10-18 13:24:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So with your current conditioning, what would your ideal rules be?
2014-10-18 13:24:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know I guess
2014-10-18 13:24:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really like the lack of symmetry in our rules
2014-10-18 13:24:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think that's fair
2014-10-18 13:25:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those weren't our rules 
2014-10-18 13:25:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah your rules
2014-10-18 13:25:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those were my ideal rules 
2014-10-18 13:25:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sorry
2014-10-18 13:26:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now tell me yours that would make you happy and would in your opinion be good for the relationship 
2014-10-18 13:26:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess polyamory would be what it came down to
2014-10-18 13:27:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't like a lack of symmetry
2014-10-18 13:27:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I don't like the idea of preventing you from loving someone else
2014-10-18 13:27:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But if I slept with someone else, would you be able to still feel the same way about me?
2014-10-18 13:28:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you slept with another woman, would you feel the same way about our relationship?
2014-10-18 13:28:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably not
2014-10-18 13:28:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for both
2014-10-18 13:28:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's why I said it would probably take some conditioning
2014-10-18 13:29:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I don't know if those are good rules to have on the table at this point in our relationship then 
2014-10-18 13:29:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why's that?
2014-10-18 13:30:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've actually heard it's worse to introduce polyamory into an established relationsihp
2014-10-18 13:30:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which makes sense
2014-10-18 13:30:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess we're already established
2014-10-18 13:33:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to lose you 
2014-10-18 13:34:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't want to lose you!
2014-10-18 13:34:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And at least right now I have zero desire to love anyone else 
2014-10-18 13:34:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I also don't have time lol
2014-10-18 13:35:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Loving you is already a full time job
2014-10-18 13:36:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's why my rules are the way they are 
2014-10-18 13:36:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe someday I'll want to change them, but right now I don't want to bring anyone else home 
2014-10-18 13:37:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess if you want to change the rules someday, though
2014-10-18 13:37:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's like
2014-10-18 13:37:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]kinda traumatic
2014-10-18 13:37:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I've read at least
2014-10-18 13:37:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like
2014-10-18 13:37:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you say one day
2014-10-18 13:37:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this person is no longer enough
2014-10-18 13:38:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to change
2014-10-18 13:38:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I want more options
2014-10-18 13:38:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's not really what polyamory is supposed to be about
2014-10-18 13:38:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know
2014-10-18 13:39:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't anticipate you ever not being enough for me. 
2014-10-18 13:39:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or my love for you dissipating, only growing and changing perhaps 
2014-10-18 13:40:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I feel the same way about you
2014-10-18 13:41:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you just said you're open to polyamory conceptually so you'd understand if I came to you at some point about it that it wasn't about you 
2014-10-18 13:41:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And vice versa 
2014-10-18 13:41:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess if you think that's a possibility I'd just rather put it in the mix now
2014-10-18 13:42:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't want to be operating under the assumption that I'm your "soulmate" or whatever
2014-10-18 13:42:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You are my soulmate 
2014-10-18 13:42:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then one day finding out you want to be loving other people
2014-10-18 13:42:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're the one pushing for polyamory 
2014-10-18 13:43:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not pushing for it I don't think
2014-10-18 13:43:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what your ideal rule was
2014-10-18 13:43:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but when you say you might one day want to do it
2014-10-18 13:43:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or be open to it
2014-10-18 13:43:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not right now
2014-10-18 13:43:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that makes me a little uncomfortable
2014-10-18 13:43:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gives me anxiety
2014-10-18 13:44:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I said that because you were saying my rules were one sided! If you want to be polyamorous now you can be but I don't want to 
2014-10-18 13:45:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe after seeing you do it for a while I'll change my mind
2014-10-18 13:45:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we wouldn't be polyamorous if you weren't in it, though
2014-10-18 13:46:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'd love you and she'd love you 
2014-10-18 13:46:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you said you weren't down with that
2014-10-18 13:47:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right now, it makes me nervous 
2014-10-18 13:47:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] I'm pretty confident in your feelings for me, but still insecure at times 
2014-10-18 13:48:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But if you maintained the level of love we have for each other and reassured me if your feelings for me I could probably feel better about it
2014-10-18 13:50:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You say that me suggesting polyamory in the future makes you anxious but you're the one who wants it now?  
2014-10-18 13:50:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't understand 
2014-10-18 13:51:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what I'm saying is
2014-10-18 13:51:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could go all in
2014-10-18 13:51:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on this relationship
2014-10-18 13:51:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if that's what you think you want
2014-10-18 13:51:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All I want to do is grab some titties and booties every once in a while because it's a novelty I don't get with you.
2014-10-18 13:52:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And for you to be happy 
2014-10-18 13:52:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And to spend the rest of my life with you 
2014-10-18 13:53:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-10-18 13:53:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm saying if you want to be with me
2014-10-18 13:53:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like fairytale romance style
2014-10-18 13:53:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can buy into that
2014-10-18 13:53:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've already been buying into it
2014-10-18 13:53:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if we did that
2014-10-18 13:53:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you one day came to me with the polyamory thing
2014-10-18 13:54:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would feel pretty betrayed
2014-10-18 13:54:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I wouldn't be interested
2014-10-18 13:54:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that would be the end of it
2014-10-18 13:55:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jeeeeeez how did this come to me defending my love for you? I was never gung-ho about the polyamory thing at all, you just said it was your philosophical ideal and so I said "ok maybe one day I can get on board with that"
2014-10-18 13:55:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't doubt your love for me
2014-10-18 13:55:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not what this is about
2014-10-18 13:56:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like you were setting me up to admit that I want polyamory 
2014-10-18 13:56:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When I don't 
2014-10-18 13:56:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nooo
2014-10-18 13:56:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not
2014-10-18 13:56:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what I'm saying
2014-10-18 13:56:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't realize you were trying to appease me
2014-10-18 13:56:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when you were saying one day you might be interested
2014-10-18 13:56:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought you were just saying one day you might be interested
2014-10-18 13:57:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and my point was
2014-10-18 13:57:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you think that's a possibility
2014-10-18 13:57:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we should just go that route now
2014-10-18 13:57:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it wouldn't mess us up later
2014-10-18 13:57:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when I imagine I'll be even more invested
2014-10-18 13:58:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think one day you'll regret not being polyamorous?
2014-10-18 13:59:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not if you stick with the fairy tale romance
2014-10-18 13:59:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you don't want to kiss or sleep with other women?
2014-10-18 13:59:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not if I get to kiss and sleep with you for the rest of my life
2014-10-18 14:00:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]then why did you say you wanted to when I said that I wanted to kiss girls every once in a while?
2014-10-18 14:01:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I do then
2014-10-18 14:02:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So which is true, I'm getting mixed signals?
2014-10-18 14:02:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm not really equating those two discussions
2014-10-18 14:02:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]making out with random chicks is not polyamory
2014-10-18 14:03:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this would be more veering towards an open relationship
2014-10-18 14:03:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I guess my train of thought then was
2014-10-18 14:04:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you can make out with girls and have a good time
2014-10-18 14:04:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why can't I
2014-10-18 14:05:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I guess would be OK within your rules
2014-10-18 14:05:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and you can, but do you actually want to or were you just saying that to be a little hurtful because you thought I would be upset with it?
2014-10-18 14:05:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-18 14:05:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could get down with  that
2014-10-18 14:05:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really think it will happen
2014-10-18 14:05:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like you said
2014-10-18 14:06:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]girls don't make out with random guys
2014-10-18 14:08:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok, so you do want to kiss other girls sometimes. but you don't want to fall in love with other people?
2014-10-18 14:08:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because you want to just love me
2014-10-18 14:11:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and you don't mind if I make out with girls every once in a while?
2014-10-18 14:11:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Accurate sum up?
2014-10-18 14:12:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]um
2014-10-18 14:12:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no I don't think so
2014-10-18 14:13:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You neve gave me your ideal rules
2014-10-18 14:13:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that you actually want and would make you happy
2014-10-18 14:13:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Instead you actually told me something that you apparently dont want
2014-10-18 14:13:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't say that
2014-10-18 14:14:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said if you want to do the one person thing
2014-10-18 14:14:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can fully commit to that
2014-10-18 14:14:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok you made me tell you my rules without considering you at all
2014-10-18 14:14:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you please do the same
2014-10-18 14:14:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I told you polyamory
2014-10-18 14:15:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you do want polyamory? 
2014-10-18 14:15:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now
2014-10-18 14:15:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]even though you said that sleeping with someone else would probably change how you felt about me
2014-10-18 14:17:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok then that's what we'll do. The rules are open for polyamory. 
2014-10-18 14:18:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well
2014-10-18 14:18:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess
2014-10-18 14:18:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's sort of a mash up of polyamory and openness
2014-10-18 14:18:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's more of a no rules thing it sounds like
2014-10-18 14:18:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If that's what you want
2014-10-18 14:19:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just saying like you hooking up with girls is not really polyamory
2014-10-18 14:19:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hooking up in general is not really polyamory
2014-10-18 14:20:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I agree
2014-10-18 14:20:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But my doing it has somehow stimulated this conversation
2014-10-18 14:21:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean "somehow?
2014-10-18 14:21:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you want a certain amount of openness in the relationship
2014-10-18 14:21:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for yourself
2014-10-18 14:21:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and unlimited openness for me
2014-10-18 14:22:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and you want polyamory
2014-10-18 14:22:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-10-18 14:22:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're basically incompatible
2014-10-18 14:22:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which isn't surprising
2014-10-18 14:22:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and explains why there is so much tension anytime this comes up
2014-10-18 14:24:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it's because your own feelings on polyamory are pretty convoluted
2014-10-18 14:24:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and because you assume I secretly want to hook up with other people and you're holding me back
2014-10-18 14:25:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hooking up != polyamory
2014-10-18 14:25:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so if this was some sort of sneaky way to get you to admit you like hooking up
2014-10-18 14:25:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]polyamory would not be the route to take
2014-10-18 14:25:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should be talking about open relationships
2014-10-18 14:26:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you sum up this conversation then?
2014-10-18 14:26:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What are the rules going forward?
2014-10-18 14:26:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-10-18 14:27:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can just go with no rules
2014-10-18 14:28:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok
2014-10-18 14:28:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]glad that's taken care of
2014-10-18 14:29:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]crash and burn
2014-10-18 14:29:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]?
2014-10-18 14:29:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this convo
2014-10-18 14:30:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes
2014-10-18 14:30:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I feel pretty bad about things now
2014-10-18 14:30:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's nice
2014-10-18 14:30:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-18 14:31:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what the fuck?
2014-10-18 14:31:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't worry about it
2014-10-18 14:31:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the rules thing is stupid
2014-10-18 14:31:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's unfortunately a reality
2014-10-18 14:31:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To have rules?
2014-10-18 14:31:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or to not have rules?
2014-10-18 14:31:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]either
2014-10-18 14:31:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the fact that there are no real rules
2014-10-18 14:31:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]makes this impossible to sort out
2014-10-18 14:32:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]if that makes you sad, then you clearly did not actually tell me your ideal rules
2014-10-18 14:32:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's pretty easy
2014-10-18 14:32:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not easy
2014-10-18 14:32:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]if something I could do would hurt or upset you, then I would like to know
2014-10-18 14:32:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's dumb to feel about those things
2014-10-18 14:33:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when it's something you'd be happy doing
2014-10-18 14:33:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't be happy doing it if I knew it upset you
2014-10-18 14:33:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's not dumb
2014-10-18 14:33:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I told you the things that would upset me.
2014-10-18 14:35:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like if you fell in love with someone else, it would break my heart. Therefore, when you start becoming close to someone and feel like you're on a precipie, you can think "Huh, is this really worth it" And if it is then you go for it
2014-10-18 14:35:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Knowing how it would affect me
2014-10-18 14:35:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I fully admit my feelings about that might not be fair, or logical but that's how they are
2014-10-18 14:36:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So if you can please tell me your illogical feelings about how my activities would affect you I'd appreciate it
2014-10-18 14:36:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So when I'm about to kiss someone I can decide if it's really worth it 
2014-10-18 14:36:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP](it's almost ertainly not)
2014-10-18 14:36:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you slept with someone
2014-10-18 14:37:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]particularly a dude
2014-10-18 14:37:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd be upset
2014-10-18 14:37:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if you did it a few times
2014-10-18 14:37:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd probably get used to it
2014-10-18 14:37:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is how I wish I already felt
2014-10-18 14:38:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How would you feel if I were out and drunkenly kissed a dude?
2014-10-18 14:38:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It'd bother me
2014-10-18 14:39:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't want it to
2014-10-18 14:40:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you rather I just didn't mention it if it happens?
2014-10-18 14:40:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-18 14:40:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd actually prefer you did it
2014-10-18 14:40:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]several times
2014-10-18 14:40:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]soon
2014-10-18 14:40:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and told me each time
2014-10-18 14:40:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I could get over it
2014-10-18 14:40:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well that's not going to happen
2014-10-18 14:41:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But thank you for telling me
2014-10-18 14:41:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I want
2014-10-18 14:43:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sorry I'm not going to make out with random dudes just to condition you out of monogamy lol
2014-10-18 14:43:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this shit is never going to get sorted out
2014-10-18 14:43:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hate it
2014-10-18 14:44:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is sorted out!
2014-10-18 14:44:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it is?
2014-10-18 16:47:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my phone should get to your place Tuesday
2014-10-18 16:47:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should try it out
2014-10-18 16:48:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will it turn on without a SIM card?
2014-10-18 16:48:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-18 16:49:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could even put your SIM in and use it for a few days if you wanted
2014-10-18 16:49:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I have the tools to unscrew my iPhone 
2014-10-18 16:50:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just a pinhole
2014-10-18 16:50:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's fine
2014-10-18 16:50:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll turn it on and stuff
2014-10-18 16:50:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You must be pretty excited 
2014-10-18 16:50:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For sure
2014-10-18 16:51:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's gonna be such a big upgrade
2014-10-18 16:51:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the new version of Android just got released
2014-10-18 16:51:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet

2014-10-18 16:53:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't shake feeling shitty. I'm wondering if it has to do with rolling twice in a week
2014-10-18 16:53:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]combined with our conversation?
2014-10-18 16:53:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-10-18 16:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess that could actually be the case
2014-10-18 16:55:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm drinking some Mountain Dew 
2014-10-18 16:55:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So hopefully I'll feel chipper in no time
2014-10-18 16:55:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was this roll?
2014-10-18 16:57:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good. Different obviously, because I didn't spend most of it naked on a bed lol
2014-10-18 16:58:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The come up still felt almost sleepy 
2014-10-18 16:58:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you take it at the show?

2014-10-18 16:59:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-18 16:59:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The crowd was a pretty interesting mix of 18 yr old raver babies, hipsters, and slightly older more professional crowd 
2014-10-18 17:00:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-10-18 17:00:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is slightly older?
2014-10-18 17:01:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like late 20s
2014-10-18 17:01:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-10-18 17:01:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Early 30s maybe 
2014-10-18 17:01:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did Dallas roll?
2014-10-18 17:02:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dallas bailed 
2014-10-18 17:02:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of course 
2014-10-18 17:02:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh you went with your friend's roommate?

2014-10-18 17:02:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you met this chick while you were waiting in line or something?
2014-10-18 17:03:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And ran into cam and his friends halfway through and hung out with him
2014-10-18 17:03:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was that?
2014-10-18 17:03:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We met in front of the building 
2014-10-18 17:03:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was pretty much a nonevent actually 
2014-10-18 17:04:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We exchanged a few words, I gave him and his friends  5 sec head rubs at some point, and that was it
2014-10-18 17:04:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When I realized he was rolling too I was a little worried he'd try to have a heart to heart or something
2014-10-18 17:05:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But he was talking to his friends most of the time 
2014-10-18 17:05:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's cool
2014-10-18 17:05:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]head rubs were just for fun?
2014-10-18 17:06:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I love giving head rubs and stuff while rolling at shows I guess 
2014-10-18 17:06:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless ppl are sweaty

2014-10-18 17:30:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's just not much of a costume
2014-10-18 17:30:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are the categories?
2014-10-18 17:30:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Best group(inc couples), scariest, best in theme, most darwinian

2014-10-19 18:09:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]though I prefer the angle you did for the last couple of seconds
2014-10-19 18:09:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where I can see your titties
2014-10-19 18:09:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think that was difficult for you

2014-10-19 18:10:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I figured you would that's an I did it, but yeah filming in general was tricky lol
2014-10-19 18:10:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was distracted 
2014-10-19 18:10:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I wonder why

2014-10-19 18:15:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I realized o was doing it again at some point that night and changed 
2014-10-19 18:16:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, I don't know why I worry about pointing it out
2014-10-19 18:17:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or asking you to do something different
2014-10-19 18:17:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't want to hurt your feelings
2014-10-19 18:17:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and for that to result in you not sucking my dick
2014-10-19 18:17:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-19 18:17:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't take offense, unless you were rude about it

2014-10-19 18:17:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what would be rude?
2014-10-19 18:18:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"What you're doing doesn't feel good." "You suck at blow jobs"

2014-10-19 18:19:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you just said, "dont fold your lips under like that" or w/e that'd be fine 
2014-10-19 18:19:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or tell me to do something I've done before that you like
2014-10-19 18:20:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word, I'm gonna be more vocal.
2014-10-19 18:20:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think that'd be fun anyway

2014-10-19 18:25:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's kinda hard to talk when there's a dick in your mouth lol
2014-10-19 18:26:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I get that. But taking it out of your mouth and saying sexy things?

2014-10-19 19:44:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like a lot of people could get by with just an antenna if they gave it a shot
2014-10-19 19:44:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think people aren't aware that the content is HD
2014-10-19 19:44:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and a lot of shows are on antenna channels
2014-10-19 19:44:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should buy one 
2014-10-19 19:45:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you and Darcy?

2014-10-19 19:52:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the Amazon one looks like it has good reviews
2014-10-19 19:52:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the Amazon version of the thin antenna
2014-10-19 19:54:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Ultra-Thin-Indoor-HDTV-Antenna/dp/B00DIFIO8E/ref=sr_1_1?s=audio-video-accessories&ie=UTF8&qid=1413766418&sr=1-1
2014-10-19 19:54:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This one?
2014-10-19 19:55:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you might not even need the 35 mile range
2014-10-19 19:55:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the other option is a 50 mile
2014-10-19 19:55:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's a 25 mile
2014-10-19 19:55:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for 18.99
2014-10-19 19:55:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Ultra-Thin-Indoor-HDTV-Antenna/dp/B00DIFIO8E/ref=sr_1_1?s=audio-video-accessories&ie=UTF8&qid=1413766418&sr=1-1
2014-10-19 19:56:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty sure all the Chicago stations are within 25 miles of you
2014-10-19 19:56:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]most of the network channels are downtown I think
2014-10-19 19:57:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but for $8 more i get 2x the range!
2014-10-19 19:58:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that one might make sense if you were in the 'burbs
2014-10-19 19:58:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how far is your range?
2014-10-19 19:58:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think mine is up 30
2014-10-19 19:58:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah

2014-10-19 20:00:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think those Amazon ones were available when I bought mine
2014-10-19 20:01:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it's on network TV
2014-10-19 20:01:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it's on SEC Network
2014-10-19 20:01:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so we'll have to stream
2014-10-19 20:01:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well so far so good with the stream

2014-10-19 20:02:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was so stressful for me
2014-10-19 20:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-19 20:02:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, I felt terrible
2014-10-19 20:02:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was mostly Auburn's fault
2014-10-19 20:02:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the stream not working just made it super frustrating
2014-10-19 20:03:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]if there are any issues we'll go straight to Jimmy's
2014-10-19 20:03:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good  😘

2014-10-19 20:28:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just have no conception of what it'll be like
2014-10-19 20:29:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like the speedy parts of molly without the euphoria
2014-10-19 20:30:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really?
2014-10-19 20:30:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought euphoria was a part of it
2014-10-19 20:30:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]not like molly euphoria

2014-10-19 20:32:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]superhuman seems a bit of a stretch
2014-10-19 20:32:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but yeah
2014-10-19 20:32:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word that sounds great to me
2014-10-19 20:32:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]though it can also make you feel cracked out and angry and stressed
2014-10-19 20:33:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are there triggers for that?
2014-10-19 20:33:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like if you're mad?
2014-10-19 20:33:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah I guess
2014-10-19 20:33:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or if you do too much
2014-10-19 20:34:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or have a tendency for those feelings I guess
2014-10-19 20:34:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like too much in a night?
2014-10-19 20:34:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like ppl I know who become jerks on coke are kinda jerks to begin with
2014-10-19 20:34:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or too much at once?
2014-10-19 20:34:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]either
2014-10-19 20:34:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-19 20:35:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]/r/Drugs has a nice wiki on cocaine

2014-10-19 20:35:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they mention increased irritability
2014-10-19 20:36:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's interesting that it can cause increased irritability and euphoria/confidence
2014-10-19 20:36:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they mention aggressiveness too
2014-10-19 20:36:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what if I rage???
2014-10-19 20:37:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i doubt that
2014-10-19 20:37:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://wiki.tripsit.me/wiki/Cocaine

2014-10-19 20:38:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm really excited to see what kind of effect it'll have on me
2014-10-19 20:38:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well hopefully we can get some
2014-10-19 20:38:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much is a "line"
2014-10-19 20:39:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or a "bump"
2014-10-19 20:39:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they have dosages like 20-50mg
2014-10-19 20:39:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for light
2014-10-19 20:39:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]100-150 mg for strong
2014-10-19 20:39:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I rarely take a line over ~100mg
2014-10-19 20:40:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like probably never
2014-10-19 20:40:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you have a sense for the size of different doses, though?
2014-10-19 20:41:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-10-19 20:41:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-10-19 20:41:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess this is kinda why I wish I could try it the night before
2014-10-19 20:42:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't have time to pick up from her before saturday
2014-10-19 20:42:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-19 20:42:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you'll be fine
2014-10-19 20:42:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-10-19 20:42:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was your first time?
2014-10-19 20:42:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it'll be exciting since it's your first time
2014-10-19 20:43:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]also coke can make me feel shitty the next day so I don't really recommend doubling up nights
2014-10-19 20:43:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]fun
2014-10-19 20:43:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you jump straight into a line?
2014-10-19 20:43:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a few key bumps
2014-10-19 20:44:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-19 20:44:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where/when did you do it for the first time?
2014-10-19 20:45:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sophomore year of college, bethroom with some sorority girls and a frat guy
2014-10-19 20:45:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I don't really remember the specifics of that night
2014-10-19 20:46:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you just remember it feeling good?
2014-10-19 20:46:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]kinda
2014-10-19 20:46:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've told you, I think coke is over rated
2014-10-19 20:47:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know
2014-10-19 20:47:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you say that
2014-10-19 20:47:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you also did it several times
2014-10-19 20:47:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you bought a little coke devie
2014-10-19 20:47:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sort of like how you say you don't like alcohol
2014-10-19 20:47:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you get drunk more than anyone I know
2014-10-19 20:48:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know people you know who gets drunk more often than me
2014-10-19 20:48:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who?
2014-10-19 20:48:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haley
2014-10-19 20:48:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really?
2014-10-19 20:48:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Shane, Seb
2014-10-19 20:48:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe Simon
2014-10-19 20:48:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do you know this?
2014-10-19 20:49:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]because Haley goes out and drinks more often than I do, or drinks quite a bit at home
2014-10-19 20:49:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and every time I hang out with Simon and them they get pretty drunk and talk about the other nights they hung out that week also getting pretty drunk
2014-10-19 20:49:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't really know those guys
2014-10-19 20:50:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Laura Merwin talks like she drinks pretty frequently at home
2014-10-19 20:50:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like a couple bottles of wine a week
2014-10-19 20:50:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm talking about getting drunk, though
2014-10-19 20:51:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I get that drunk that often
2014-10-19 20:51:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how many times did you get drunk this week?
2014-10-19 20:51:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Saturday
2014-10-19 20:52:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and last Saturday
2014-10-19 20:52:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah I guess you just rolled Friday
2014-10-19 20:52:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you didn't get drunk during the week?
2014-10-19 20:52:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no
2014-10-19 20:53:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't even have a drink on Thursday or Wednesday
2014-10-19 20:54:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-10-19 20:54:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]anyways, I did coke because it helps when going out until 5a
2014-10-19 20:54:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and because I was working 3 nights a week 
2014-10-19 20:54:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and it was social
2014-10-19 20:55:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you saying you were tired with the work thing?
2014-10-19 20:55:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure what that's supposed to mean
2014-10-19 20:56:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah, so sometimes if I wanted to go out on a Friday and I had some I'd take a little bump
2014-10-19 20:56:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-19 20:57:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it'd just wake you up and get you feeling good?
2014-10-19 20:57:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes
2014-10-19 20:57:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-10-19 20:57:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's not awesome?
2014-10-19 20:57:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't understand why you always feel the need to say it's overrated
2014-10-19 20:58:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well you can try it for yourself and see if it lives up to the hype
2014-10-19 20:58:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think it does
2014-10-19 20:58:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the hype thing is what I don't get
2014-10-19 20:58:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I really hope I get the chance!
2014-10-19 20:59:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it actually sounds like a drug I could really enjoy
2014-10-19 20:59:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sje says she can get some
2014-10-19 20:59:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whoop
2014-10-19 21:01:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]just don't become a coke head lol
2014-10-19 21:01:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's your definition of a coke head
2014-10-19 21:01:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]feeling like you have to do it to have a good time
2014-10-19 21:01:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-19 21:01:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was literally just thinking I'd love to have a go-to drug for going out
2014-10-19 21:02:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]doing it every weekend
2014-10-19 21:02:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]spending lots of money on it
2014-10-19 21:02:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]getting angry while on it, constantly looking for more
2014-10-19 21:02:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I'm not trying to be an addict obviously
2014-10-19 21:02:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would you dump me if I became one?
2014-10-19 21:04:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no but I would obviously try to change it
2014-10-19 21:04:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]makes sense
2014-10-19 21:05:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've drank plenty while doing coke before right?
2014-10-19 21:05:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes
2014-10-19 21:05:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-10-19 21:05:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]within reason
2014-10-19 21:06:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I've ever been "wasted" on it
2014-10-19 21:06:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word. I won't slam drinks I guess.
2014-10-19 21:09:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1onvj5/is_it_just_me_or_is_cocaine_not_all_its_cracked/
2014-10-19 21:10:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol, this is honestly it's biggest appeal to me -->  http://www.reddit.com/r/Drugs/comments/1usq2p/cocaine_uh_yeah/celatti
2014-10-19 21:12:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]to be able to drink more?
2014-10-19 21:12:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not drink more
2014-10-19 21:12:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but make drinking fun
2014-10-19 21:13:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love this subreddit, man
2014-10-19 21:13:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so many different perspectives
2014-10-19 21:13:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no agendas
2014-10-19 21:14:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting how several commenters say girls love coke
2014-10-19 21:14:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder what's going on there
2014-10-19 21:14:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]propaganda
2014-10-19 21:15:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like girls think they should like it?
2014-10-19 21:15:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like, girls have been shown in movies that coke is a sexy drugs
2014-10-19 21:15:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i mean they might like it
2014-10-19 21:16:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's kinda interesting how you always mention coke as glamorous
2014-10-19 21:16:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my perspective has always been that it's kinda dangerous
2014-10-19 21:16:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I think them saying white college girls love it more than other ppl is not reflective of an actuall physiological difference
2014-10-19 21:16:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and my mental image is of fiends and gangsters
2014-10-19 21:16:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh definitely not
2014-10-19 21:16:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's definitely, like, a yuppie drug
2014-10-19 21:16:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which would explain why white college girls are all about it
2014-10-19 21:18:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a lot of these people seem to agree with you, though
2014-10-19 21:18:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just have a hard time believing it's not a good time
2014-10-19 21:18:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when celebrities eat it up
2014-10-19 21:19:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's part of their culture I guess
2014-10-19 21:20:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's gotta be fun too, though, for it to have been so persistently popular among celbs
2014-10-19 21:25:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I've actually been drinking a lot less as we've been dating
2014-10-19 21:25:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really?
2014-10-19 21:26:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much were you drinking before?
2014-10-19 21:26:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I went through a phase in winter wher I had a 2-3 glasses of wine most nights
2014-10-19 21:28:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't get drunk except once every 2 weeks though
2014-10-19 21:28:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]similiar to now
2014-10-19 21:28:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haven't you been drunk several weekends in a row at this point?
2014-10-19 21:28:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you'll probably get drunk the next couple of weekends too
2014-10-19 21:29:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well there's a lot of events this month I guess
2014-10-19 21:29:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-19 21:29:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it'd be interesting to track
2014-10-19 21:29:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I feel like you wouldn't be interested in that
2014-10-19 21:29:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-19 21:39:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]first 2 episodes of gotham were good
2014-10-19 21:39:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-10-19 21:39:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]glad you liked them
2014-10-19 21:39:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was worried I had over-hyped them a bit
2014-10-19 21:40:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not like they're amazing television
2014-10-19 21:40:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I enjoy it
2014-10-19 21:40:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-10-19 21:40:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's fun tv drama
2014-10-19 21:40:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-19 21:41:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if it wasn't in the Batman universe
2014-10-19 21:41:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I probably wouldn't watch
2014-10-19 21:41:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm a sucker for origin stories
2014-10-19 21:42:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]me too
2014-10-19 21:42:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i loved smallville
2014-10-19 21:42:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I never watched that, actually
2014-10-19 21:43:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you know bullwhips create little sonic booms?
2014-10-19 21:43:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes
2014-10-19 21:45:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have a sponsored ad on Facebook saying "Buying a Bra Can Be Fun!"
2014-10-19 21:45:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with a picture of a girl in a bra
2014-10-19 21:45:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from Nordstrom apparently
2014-10-19 21:46:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hmmm
2014-10-19 21:46:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]missed the mark there, Facebook
2014-10-19 21:46:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe they were thinkin you could buy one for me?
2014-10-19 21:46:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha is that something guys do?
2014-10-19 21:46:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never bought a bra
2014-10-19 21:46:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've bought a thong
2014-10-19 21:46:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and some lingerie
2014-10-19 21:47:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well lingerie usually invoves a bra
2014-10-19 21:47:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's true
2014-10-19 21:47:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you know my size?
2014-10-19 21:47:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-19 21:47:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know B
2014-10-19 21:48:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's it
2014-10-19 21:48:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I know wouldn't get me far
2014-10-19 21:48:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna go with 32
2014-10-19 21:48:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]34-B
2014-10-19 21:50:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so close
2014-10-19 21:50:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha is it?
2014-10-19 21:50:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know it's a size difference
2014-10-19 21:50:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that could be like the difference between a small and a medium for all I know
2014-10-19 21:51:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess there's a 9 cm window
2014-10-19 21:51:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if 68cm is the low end of 32

2014-10-19 21:56:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because the letters change
2014-10-19 21:56:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with the size
2014-10-19 21:56:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]unless they were fake and you were incredibly tiny

2014-10-19 21:59:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm assuming they're guessing
2014-10-19 21:59:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha

2014-10-19 22:04:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is like a hyper stimulus

2014-10-19 22:07:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like would you find this attractive, or do you really not care what I wear in bed?
2014-10-19 22:08:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would find that attractive
2014-10-19 22:08:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I guess I'm not sure what the motivation is here
2014-10-19 22:08:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just curious
2014-10-19 22:08:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like... is the point to look sexy when you go to sleep?
2014-10-19 22:08:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or is this something you'd put on
2014-10-19 22:08:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]before we were gonna have sex?
2014-10-19 22:09:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no, something to sleep in
2014-10-19 22:09:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]other than an oversized shirt
2014-10-19 22:09:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]obviously sex might happen anyways
2014-10-19 22:09:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-10-19 22:10:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you don't have to wear anything like that for me
2014-10-19 22:10:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if you wanted to do it for you
2014-10-19 22:10:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you'd look good
2014-10-19 22:12:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't know if you particularly cared if I looked grungy in bed or not
2014-10-19 22:13:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-19 22:13:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I've always wanted real pj sets I guess
2014-10-19 22:13:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never dated a girl who dressed nice for sleep
2014-10-19 22:13:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oversized t-shirts seem to be wear it's at
2014-10-19 22:15:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lol 'wear'

2014-10-19 22:23:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what if no one wants to travel to our national park wedding?
2014-10-19 22:23:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't care
2014-10-19 22:23:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-19 22:23:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you have to rent a car from the airport to go to one
2014-10-19 22:23:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we can go to a national park for our honeymoon?
2014-10-19 22:24:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whatever you want to do, sugar
2014-10-19 22:24:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want a big party with all of our friends and family
2014-10-19 22:24:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let's do that then
2014-10-19 22:25:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but we can still make it outside
2014-10-19 22:25:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]near trees
2014-10-19 22:25:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]eh
2014-10-19 22:25:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess if that's what you want

2014-10-19 22:28:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I mean it
2014-10-19 22:29:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what about the chicago botanic garden?
2014-10-19 22:30:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm honestly down with anything.
2014-10-19 22:30:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you have anything pictured in your mind?
2014-10-19 22:32:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]pretty lights, really excellent food, some kind of outdoor terrace thing for cocktail hour
2014-10-19 22:32:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]not too hoity toity
2014-10-19 22:32:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]dude, if we want to get married in 2016 we have to make a reservation like soon
2014-10-19 22:33:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]by May of 2015
2014-10-19 22:33:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]At the Chicago Botanical Gardens?
2014-10-19 22:33:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]anywhere
2014-10-19 22:34:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Anywhere in Chicago?
2014-10-19 22:34:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's just how it is with reserving wedding venues
2014-10-19 22:35:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you have to do it like a year in advance to get the date you want
2014-10-19 22:35:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you want May I guess?
2014-10-19 22:35:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we can get married in 2017 then
2014-10-19 22:35:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and since alot of outdoor places are closed 6 months of the year, you have fewer otions
2014-10-19 22:39:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe august
2014-10-19 22:39:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or seeptember, that'd be nice
2014-10-19 22:40:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.
2014-10-19 22:42:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha sorry to be pushy about it
2014-10-19 22:43:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not trying to rush your proposal    😉 
2014-10-19 22:45:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh I don't think you're being pushy. It sounds like 2017 is more likely
2014-10-19 22:45:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP];(
2014-10-19 22:45:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which might make more sense.
2014-10-19 22:45:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] 😞 
2014-10-19 22:48:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha maybe you're right
2014-10-19 22:48:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just liked the sound of 2016
2014-10-19 22:49:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What for?
2014-10-19 22:50:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well in 2017 you'll be 30
2014-10-19 22:50:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to marry a 30 year old lol
2014-10-19 22:51:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wow I will be!
2014-10-19 22:51:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Crazy.
2014-10-19 22:51:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it just sounds far away
2014-10-19 22:52:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and for something we talk about this much already, it's a long time to wait
2014-10-19 22:53:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-19 22:53:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just don't know if we'll be ready to prepare that early?
2014-10-19 22:53:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]wellllll that's why I'm getting an idea now
2014-10-19 22:55:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.chicagobotanic.org/events/spaces/outdoor
2014-10-19 22:57:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess there's so much up in the air about our budget too
2014-10-19 22:58:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we could do a wedding in Chicago for ~$12,000
2014-10-19 23:00:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-10-19 23:00:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so how do you want to go about this?
2014-10-19 23:01:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]woahhhh for catering at the botanic gardens it's $160 per person
2014-10-19 23:01:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-19 23:01:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]my estimated budget may be slightly off lol
2014-10-19 23:01:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have a feeling the botanic garden is not the cheapest place for a wedding
2014-10-19 23:01:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess not
2014-10-19 23:01:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]weddings at botanic gardens are usually nice
2014-10-19 23:01:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but it's so prety
2014-10-19 23:02:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-19 23:02:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hence the high rate
2014-10-19 23:06:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]did you mean how do I want to go about paying for this?
2014-10-19 23:07:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant like organizing and all that
2014-10-19 23:08:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess we don't need to do anything right this second
2014-10-19 23:10:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I'll call a couple venues at some point and see how fast dates fill up 
2014-10-19 23:12:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-19 23:12:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's hard for me to really think about all this stuff
2014-10-19 23:12:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when it's like two years away
2014-10-19 23:12:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at the least
2014-10-19 23:13:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and there are going to be some significant changes next summer
2014-10-19 23:13:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]fair enough 
2014-10-19 23:13:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know the job thing has you a little worried too
2014-10-19 23:14:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-19 23:15:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]this time next year, we'll be in our awesome apt in a hip neighborhood, cuddling after you left your awesome job, planning an awesome wedding
2014-10-19 23:16:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you
2014-10-19 23:16:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok I'll probably do most of the planning, let's be real
2014-10-19 23:16:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-10-19 23:16:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that is accurate
2014-10-19 23:16:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're probably gonna hate me
2014-10-19 23:16:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-19 23:17:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]nooo I'm ok with it
2014-10-19 23:17:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you just have to promise to fake an opinion about the food I like and the location I like
2014-10-19 23:17:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol OK
2014-10-19 23:18:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The opinion of "Wow this really is the best lobster bisque ever, what a great find" would be acceptable
2014-10-19 23:18:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-19 23:18:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll stow that one away
2014-10-19 23:19:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this wedding is gonna be like $30k
2014-10-19 23:19:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]noooo
2014-10-19 23:19:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how much was your brothers?
2014-10-19 23:19:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-10-19 23:19:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll ask him
2014-10-19 23:19:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lol that'll really get the family talking
2014-10-19 23:19:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt he'll say anything to my parents
2014-10-19 23:20:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guarantee it actually
2014-10-19 23:20:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I asked my sister
2014-10-19 23:20:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she might say something to my mom
2014-10-19 23:23:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bet we could do $20k
2014-10-19 23:23:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-10-19 23:23:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my mom has already promised me $10k to run away with you
2014-10-19 23:23:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-19 23:23:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so she'd probably donate that to an actual wedding
2014-10-19 23:23:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-10-19 23:24:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I really have no sense of scale
2014-10-19 23:24:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]particularly for a place like Chicago
2014-10-19 23:24:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just know things get expensive fast
2014-10-19 23:25:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't care for a shitton of flowers
2014-10-19 23:26:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]orrrr you get married in a conservatory that already has flowers!
2014-10-19 23:26:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-19 23:26:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there you go
2014-10-19 23:27:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like that you're so excited about it
2014-10-19 23:28:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and we won't get married on a saturday, that cuts the price in half
2014-10-19 23:28:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that affects people attending
2014-10-19 23:28:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's a reason most weddings are on Saturdays
2014-10-19 23:29:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If people can't take a day off of work, they don't love us enough
2014-10-19 23:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-19 23:29:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]couldn't you make the argument for a nat'l park weding then?
2014-10-19 23:30:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That would be really expensive for ppl to visit I feel like
2014-10-19 23:30:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]people get vacation days
2014-10-19 23:30:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more expensive than Chicago?
2014-10-19 23:30:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]there's public transport in chicago
2014-10-19 23:30:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but hotels
2014-10-19 23:30:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the hotels are like
2014-10-19 23:30:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]5x
2014-10-19 23:30:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and wouldn't require a 2+ hour drive from the airport
2014-10-19 23:34:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]they would stay at a hotel in a park too
2014-10-19 23:34:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-10-19 23:34:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the hotels are like 5x more expensive
2014-10-19 23:34:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in Chicago
2014-10-19 23:35:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is what I'm saying
2014-10-19 23:35:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but would there even be hotel options? 
2014-10-19 23:35:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-10-19 23:35:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm assuming we'd get married at a lodge in the middle of nowhere
2014-10-19 23:36:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's all academic at this point
2014-10-19 23:38:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well if you really want a national park wedding I'll look into it
2014-10-19 23:38:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't
2014-10-19 23:38:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want whatever you want

2014-10-20 10:12:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Apple clearly has a sense of humor
2014-10-20 10:12:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe you just have sexual selection on the brain?    😉 
2014-10-20 10:13:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dork
2014-10-20 10:13:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-20 10:13:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how are you doing?
2014-10-20 10:13:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sleepy 
2014-10-20 10:13:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And was having super strange dreams 
2014-10-20 10:13:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah?
2014-10-20 10:13:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like what?
2014-10-20 10:15:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was playing an RPG like video game, but I was the character. And lived on this space station with all these virtual reality rooms and these 2 like 18 year old college guys wanted to have an orgy with me but their penises were too small  
2014-10-20 10:16:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha what
2014-10-20 10:16:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's so weird
2014-10-20 10:17:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so they were like
2014-10-20 10:17:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]getting ready to have an orgy
2014-10-20 10:17:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you thought
2014-10-20 10:17:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]their penises are too small?
2014-10-20 10:17:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like they couldn't get hard 
2014-10-20 10:17:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They were too nervous 
2014-10-20 10:17:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha wow
2014-10-20 10:17:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And they were small 
2014-10-20 10:19:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There was a part where I was swimming in the fake ocean and kept hitting the boundary
2014-10-20 10:19:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it was like it was in video games where I could still swim but wasn't going anywhere 
2014-10-20 10:20:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How are you?
2014-10-20 10:21:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not bad.
2014-10-20 10:21:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't work right now because I lost my two-step authentication token for Red Hat
2014-10-20 10:21:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I had to reset my phone
2014-10-20 10:21:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they are being slow about helping me
2014-10-20 10:22:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lame 
2014-10-20 10:22:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no sexually frustrated orgy dreams, though
2014-10-20 10:23:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lol 
2014-10-20 10:23:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wasn't sexually frustrated, it felt like the sims where you just decide to make a situation happen because it's funny 
2014-10-20 10:35:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.lifehack.org/articles/lifestyle/20-things-remember-you-love-person-with-add.html?dgs=2
2014-10-20 10:35:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]via your aunt lol
2014-10-20 10:41:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]reading over the symptoms on Wikipedia is interesting with how well I know you now
2014-10-20 10:41:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh yeah?
2014-10-20 10:42:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-20 10:42:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how so?
2014-10-20 10:42:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder how these disorders are identified
2014-10-20 10:42:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like do these symptoms occur together
2014-10-20 10:42:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]frequently enough
2014-10-20 10:43:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that it merits its own diagnosis?
2014-10-20 10:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just a lot of things I've noticed about you
2014-10-20 10:43:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are apparently common in ADHD
2014-10-20 10:43:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like missing details
2014-10-20 10:43:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and forgetting things
2014-10-20 10:43:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"show emotions without restraint"
2014-10-20 10:44:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]poor handwriting is apparently associated with ADHD
2014-10-20 10:44:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd kinda interesting
2014-10-20 10:44:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so is driving tickets
2014-10-20 10:45:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]of which I have 4 lol
2014-10-20 10:45:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-20 10:45:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like some of this stuff
2014-10-20 10:45:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see in myself
2014-10-20 10:45:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and my brother is diagnosed
2014-10-20 10:45:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm just thinking about this kind of stuff is always on a spectrum
2014-10-20 10:45:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure it is
2014-10-20 10:45:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]these psychiatric disorders
2014-10-20 10:47:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I definitely don't have the paying attention problems
2014-10-20 10:48:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I guess I wonder why the other stuff gets bundled in with it
2014-10-20 10:48:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's like p(emotional outbursts | trouble paying attention) is higher than just p(emotional outbursts)
2014-10-20 10:48:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you seem to be pretty good at working on projects til completetion and not procrastinating
2014-10-20 10:48:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah basically any of the pay attention
2014-10-20 10:49:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]/get things done
2014-10-20 10:49:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]parts
2014-10-20 10:49:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't have
2014-10-20 10:49:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well that's the crux of ADD lol
2014-10-20 10:49:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know
2014-10-20 10:49:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I have ADD
2014-10-20 10:49:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just thinking about how these things work
2014-10-20 10:50:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm probably on the bipolar spectrum
2014-10-20 10:50:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I were to guess
2014-10-20 10:51:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like some of the diagnoses for this stuff is contingent on how much it affects for productivity or w/e
2014-10-20 10:52:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, right
2014-10-20 10:53:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]5. They can’t concentrate when they are emotional If there is something worrisome going on, or if they are upset, a person with ADD cannot think of anything else. This makes concentration on work, conversation, and social situations almost impossible.
2014-10-20 10:53:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like that
2014-10-20 10:53:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would say is very true for me
2014-10-20 10:54:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I told you that one night you were mad at me or something
2014-10-20 10:54:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had to stop working
2014-10-20 10:54:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and just lie on the bed
2014-10-20 10:54:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]7. They have difficulty stopping a task when they are in the zone And under the deep ocean is where they stay for hours. Even when their oxygen is running low, if they are enjoying the view, they won’t come up for air until they’re almost out of oxygen.
2014-10-20 10:54:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that is clearly true of me
2014-10-20 10:54:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I encrypted my phone this weekend
2014-10-20 10:54:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it completely fucked up
2014-10-20 10:55:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and wouldn't start
2014-10-20 10:55:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and because it was encrypted
2014-10-20 10:55:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had to do all this terminal stuff
2014-10-20 10:55:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]connected to my phone
2014-10-20 10:55:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I wanted to get data off it
2014-10-20 10:55:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]before factory resetting it
2014-10-20 10:56:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I hadn't moved some of your snaps off of it
2014-10-20 10:56:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I worked on it for like several hours straight
2014-10-20 10:56:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm mostly interested in the causal mechanisms
2014-10-20 10:56:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like what is going on at the neuron level
2014-10-20 10:56:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why are these things associated with one another
2014-10-20 10:57:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why can a person have some, but not all, of the symptoms
2014-10-20 10:57:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]9. They have verbal outbursts Their intense emotions are hard to regulate. Since they impulsively say whatever they think, they often say things they later regret. It’s almost impossible for them to edit their words before they release them.
2014-10-20 10:58:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's definitely something I noticed about you
2014-10-20 10:58:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that I've never really dealt with
2014-10-20 10:59:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I definitely have the bouncing leg thing
2014-10-20 10:59:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've had people tell me to stop shaking in church and at the movies
2014-10-20 10:59:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-20 10:59:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and in bed!
2014-10-20 11:01:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]16. They need space to pace When talking on the phone or having a conversation, people with ADD think better when they are in motion. Movement is calming and brings clarity to their thoughts.
2014-10-20 11:01:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-20 11:01:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've noticed that about you too
2014-10-20 11:11:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sorry my mom alled me
2014-10-20 11:11:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*called me
2014-10-20 11:11:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I had to pace around to talk to her lol
2014-10-20 11:13:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it sounds like they know a little bit about the 'chemical imbalances' but maybe not the actual receptors that vary within ppl
2014-10-20 11:20:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess the difficultly stopping a task when in the zone is only really interesting if you hae attention difficulties at other times
2014-10-20 11:31:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess what I'm thinking is either every brain has a disorder or no brain has a disorder
2014-10-20 11:32:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*psychiatric
2014-10-20 11:32:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we should just identify the drugs
2014-10-20 11:32:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that alleviate symptoms
2014-10-20 11:32:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and if people have those symptoms
2014-10-20 11:32:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]give them the drug
2014-10-20 11:32:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a disorder if it affects your life
2014-10-20 11:32:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and don't worry about classifying these things
2014-10-20 11:32:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-10-20 11:32:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]everybody's brain affects their life, though
2014-10-20 11:33:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok if it negatively affects your life
2014-10-20 11:33:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and is holding you back from the life you want to live
2014-10-20 11:33:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-10-20 11:33:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so 
2014-10-20 11:33:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have some symptom
2014-10-20 11:33:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that is bothering you
2014-10-20 11:33:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or making you unhappy
2014-10-20 11:34:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tell your doctor
2014-10-20 11:34:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they give you the drug
2014-10-20 11:34:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]everyone may have some symptoms, but not everyone will be negatovely affected by them
2014-10-20 11:34:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]actually, it should be your choice whether or not you take the drug
2014-10-20 11:34:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you should have to consult a doctor first
2014-10-20 11:34:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you shouldn't need permission
2014-10-20 11:35:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the choice should be informed though, because you could take it and the side effects make you even more "not normal"
2014-10-20 11:35:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-10-20 11:35:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you should be required to consult a doctor
2014-10-20 11:35:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's it
2014-10-20 11:35:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]once you have the information
2014-10-20 11:35:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can make the choice yourself
2014-10-20 11:35:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what about drugs that can be misused recreationally?
2014-10-20 11:35:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you already know my opinion on that
2014-10-20 11:35:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and ppl are just getting them for fun
2014-10-20 11:36:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok, but that can actually cause drug shortages
2014-10-20 11:36:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the CVS in Miami frequently ran out of adderall
2014-10-20 11:36:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and people who really needed it to function were fucked
2014-10-20 11:36:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is their a limiting factor on how much adderall pharmaceutical companies can make?
2014-10-20 11:36:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or do they just have an artificially low perception of demand
2014-10-20 11:37:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it's regulated
2014-10-20 11:37:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*there
2014-10-20 11:37:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]pergaps it's the latter
2014-10-20 11:37:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so there wouldn't be shortages if it was unregulated then
2014-10-20 11:37:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it would be in the companies' best interests to produce enough
2014-10-20 11:37:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know
2014-10-20 11:38:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok, I'm trying to write and you're distracting me lol
2014-10-20 11:38:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you, I'll talk to you later!
2014-10-20 11:38:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too
2014-10-20 15:18:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I actually wrote a whole page
2014-10-20 15:18:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and it's not bad
2014-10-20 15:18:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice!
2014-10-20 15:18:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got connected to the VPN
2014-10-20 15:18:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]woohoo
2014-10-20 15:19:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]$$$$
2014-10-20 15:19:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-10-20 15:19:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was my Chicago trip for my birthday paid for by your ponts?
2014-10-20 15:19:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]points
2014-10-20 15:21:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no, it was paid for by me
2014-10-20 15:21:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but it was cheap cause we got it during a sale
2014-10-20 15:21:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK  😘   
2014-10-20 15:21:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so have you gotten any free flights yet?
2014-10-20 15:21:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the one to visit you
2014-10-20 15:22:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, right
2014-10-20 15:22:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I'm buying the Disney one tomorrow when my next points from my credit card statement get added
2014-10-20 15:22:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet
2014-10-20 15:23:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and then I should have another free one pretty soon because of the "spend $2000 get 50k points" thing
2014-10-20 15:24:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. Seems to be paying off in that case.
2014-10-20 15:26:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]for sure
2014-10-20 15:27:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe we can plan a little warm weather trip in February when you don't want to visit me in Chicago    😉 
2014-10-20 15:27:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that'd be fun
2014-10-20 16:09:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you use a GUI when coding withpython?
2014-10-20 16:31:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just started using PyCharm like a week ago.
2014-10-20 16:31:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If by GUI you mean IDE
2014-10-20 16:31:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's pretty solid, though.
2014-10-20 16:32:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-10-20 16:32:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm using IDLE
2014-10-20 16:32:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's ok
2014-10-20 16:32:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I's like something like RStudio
2014-10-20 16:32:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, try PyCharm.
2014-10-20 16:33:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The company that makes PyCharm makes a Java IDE that I've been using for a while that is really good.
2014-10-20 16:37:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so many keyboard shortcuts
2014-10-20 16:42:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you like about RStudio?
2014-10-20 16:42:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My Hangouts notifications are all jacked on my phone. I don't get it.
2014-10-20 16:44:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that it tells me the variables I've defined, and that I can click on them and see them, and that I can click on a line that I want to run instead of c/p it to the shell
2014-10-20 16:45:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if there's anything like that for Python.
2014-10-20 16:45:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think PyCharm might show you variables you've defined.
2014-10-20 16:47:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]word
2014-10-20 16:47:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I may have you walk me through how to use it
2014-10-20 16:47:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't really feel like digging through a manual at this point
2014-10-20 16:51:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There's a quick start guide that's pretty easy to follow.  http://confluence.jetbrains.com/display/PYH/Getting+Started+with+PyCharm
2014-10-20 16:51:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I can help you out too.
2014-10-20 16:52:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's honestly not gonna be much different than IDLE
2014-10-20 16:52:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely not gonna give you an RStudio like experience.
2014-10-20 16:53:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's more to make writing code more efficient.
2014-10-20 17:17:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah that's what it seems like
2014-10-20 17:18:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In almost done with the 1st chapter in bioinformatics 
2014-10-20 17:18:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You did ask the exercises?
2014-10-20 17:18:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All*
2014-10-20 17:22:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't do any detour stuff, and I have like 3 more sections 
2014-10-20 17:23:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So if there are exercises in those than not yet 
2014-10-20 17:24:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I got the other ones 
2014-10-20 17:25:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And now I'm off to Zumba it up
2014-10-20 17:39:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice! I'm impressed.
2014-10-20 18:23:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Impressed that I went to Zumba?
2014-10-20 18:23:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no that you knocked out all those coding assignments
2014-10-20 18:23:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was doing some last night before we got into wedding planning lol
2014-10-20 18:24:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-10-20 18:24:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still, sounds like you must be picking up Python ok
2014-10-20 18:25:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I did the string exercises on Rosalind and looked at ppls answers and picked up some tricks 
2014-10-20 18:25:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-10-20 18:25:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Other than the work issue, how was your day?
2014-10-20 18:26:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fine I suppose.
2014-10-20 18:26:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm starting to get over going to class.
2014-10-20 18:26:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not really what I wanted to say
2014-10-20 18:26:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm starting to really not like going to class
2014-10-20 18:27:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha any of them?
2014-10-20 18:27:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that's not really novel 
2014-10-20 18:27:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mostly Algorithms and Bionformatics
2014-10-20 18:29:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you're going to miss more next week
2014-10-20 18:29:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-10-20 18:29:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty excited about that
2014-10-20 18:29:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it'll be a short week
2014-10-20 18:29:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then I only have five more weeks of class after that
2014-10-20 18:29:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I can grind it out
2014-10-20 18:29:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice

2014-10-20 19:38:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]if you really don't like anything I make with it you can eat barilla pasta bowls those nights
2014-10-20 19:39:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-10-20 19:40:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I think you will
2014-10-20 19:40:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like some of them at least
2014-10-20 19:41:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm definitely looking forward to trying them out
2014-10-20 19:45:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I loveeee you
2014-10-20 19:45:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I loveeee you too
2014-10-20 19:46:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]time has been moving slowly for me this gap
2014-10-20 19:47:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah?
2014-10-20 19:47:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the level of intimacy/comfort we've reached with each other is pretty impressive
2014-10-20 19:47:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]considering the amount of time we've spent together
2014-10-20 19:48:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the fact that it's always bookended by extended periods of time of being apart
2014-10-20 19:50:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe it helps
2014-10-20 19:51:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we really try to appreciate each other as much as possible when we're together
2014-10-20 19:51:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's true
2014-10-20 19:52:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, snap

2014-10-20 19:53:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha truth
2014-10-20 20:18:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If we do get some blow for this weekend, you could do a line off my tits
2014-10-20 20:18:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never done that before but always wanted to
2014-10-20 20:18:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah?
2014-10-20 20:18:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just like the thought of it?
2014-10-20 20:18:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, I guess it's pretty cliched
2014-10-20 20:19:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I think it'd be sexy
2014-10-20 20:19:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sold
2014-10-20 20:19:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are our odds looking like?
2014-10-20 20:22:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]she told me last night she could et some and asked how much I wanted and then never texted back
2014-10-20 20:22:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll text her tm about price
2014-10-20 20:22:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-10-20 20:23:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the dude I texted replied too and said it was actually his friend who was the dealer, he just buys a lot lol
2014-10-20 20:23:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so I have that option too
2014-10-20 20:23:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-10-20 20:23:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when was the last time you did coke?
2014-10-20 20:28:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did some in Miami in March
2014-10-20 20:29:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but before that it had been like 9 months
2014-10-20 21:11:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wanna have a wine and cheese party
2014-10-20 21:28:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well why don't you have one?
2014-10-20 21:29:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well maybe I will!
2014-10-20 21:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm so sick of being evaluated by quizzes/exams
2014-10-20 21:31:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're like insta-existential crisis triggers for me
2014-10-20 21:32:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha aww
2014-10-20 21:33:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'll be over soon
2014-10-20 21:33:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and then the other bullshit of the workd can be your existential triggers
2014-10-20 21:34:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I honestly don't think anything else can come even close
2014-10-20 21:34:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like how utterly meaningless is a fucking grade
2014-10-20 21:34:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm investing this time
2014-10-20 21:34:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and stress
2014-10-20 21:34:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]instead of enjoying my life
2014-10-20 21:34:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not for some rewarding experience at the end
2014-10-20 21:35:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for a letter
2014-10-20 21:37:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because certain letters will keep me from being allowed to do something at least marginally rewarding with my time
2014-10-20 21:37:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]such a backwards philosophy for education
2014-10-20 21:37:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know I know
2014-10-20 21:38:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you are learning a little bit though, even if it's not the ideal way you'd like to learn the material
2014-10-20 21:39:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and you only have 6 months left of classes until you're doe
2014-10-20 21:39:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]forever
2014-10-20 21:40:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]until you guilt me into getting a PhD
2014-10-20 21:40:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]babeeee
2014-10-20 21:40:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't care if you have a phd
2014-10-20 21:40:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just want you ti be happy
2014-10-20 21:40:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know I know
2014-10-20 21:41:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and you said before you met me you thought doing a PhD would make you happy
2014-10-20 21:42:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess I'd like to have an income
2014-10-20 21:42:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm sure that's the case for a lot of people
2014-10-20 21:43:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it's really sweet how you care about money for our future
2014-10-20 21:43:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not that worried about it though
2014-10-20 21:44:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we're going to be fine
2014-10-20 21:47:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-10-20 21:48:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]dude, red hat loves you
2014-10-20 21:48:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]everyone will love you
2014-10-20 21:48:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to get a job one way or another when I get out
2014-10-20 21:49:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-20 21:49:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we're in very different financial situations
2014-10-20 21:49:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which probably accounts for our different perspectives
2014-10-20 21:50:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we make about the same annual salary right now
2014-10-20 21:50:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't have an annual salary
2014-10-20 21:51:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you're making money
2014-10-20 21:51:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-20 21:51:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm 50k in debt
2014-10-20 21:51:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not a long-term position at this point
2014-10-20 21:51:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm 27
2014-10-20 21:51:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and in this situation
2014-10-20 21:51:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've got zero debt
2014-10-20 21:51:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're 23
2014-10-20 21:52:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and have five years of income locked up at the least
2014-10-20 21:52:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you have health insurance
2014-10-20 21:52:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]dude, you're going to get a job
2014-10-20 21:52:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that will blow my job and benefits out of the water
2014-10-20 21:52:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]'job'
2014-10-20 21:52:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you're so silly
2014-10-20 21:52:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm talking about this all in the context of getting a PhD
2014-10-20 21:53:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you see why the money thing matters
2014-10-20 21:53:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with those numbers?
2014-10-20 21:53:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]if you want a PhD when I finish mine, you have that option
2014-10-20 21:54:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll just get to be the one with a real salary lol
2014-10-20 21:54:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess
2014-10-20 21:54:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we'll pay your debts off in the next couple of years
2014-10-20 21:55:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and even if I get a postdoc for 45k and you have a phd for 30k we're still making bank
2014-10-20 21:55:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I'd call that making bank
2014-10-20 21:55:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-20 21:56:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we're living comfortably
2014-10-20 21:56:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]just maybe not in NYC
2014-10-20 21:56:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]of LA
2014-10-20 21:56:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we won't be saving any money
2014-10-20 21:57:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah we will. 
2014-10-20 21:57:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not like "real" money
2014-10-20 21:57:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it would depend on the kind of lifestyle we wanted
2014-10-20 21:57:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess this is all hypothetical at this point
2014-10-20 21:57:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]exactly
2014-10-20 21:58:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can deal with those things as they happen
2014-10-20 21:58:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes
2014-10-20 21:58:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I could have a job of 70k+ by the time I'm 30
2014-10-20 21:59:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would think you're doing pretty good for yourself if that's the case
2014-10-20 22:00:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I plan to do pretty well for myself
2014-10-20 22:01:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do want a jacuzzi at some point
2014-10-20 22:02:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's when I know I've made it
2014-10-20 22:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ha
2014-10-20 22:02:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we can just leave in an undergrad apartment complex
2014-10-20 22:03:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you plan on graduating in five years?
2014-10-20 22:04:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]two year post-doc
2014-10-20 22:04:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]than a job?
2014-10-20 22:04:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to have a $70k job by 30
2014-10-20 22:04:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-10-20 22:04:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]dude, Sophie got a 55k postdoc and already has a job offer
2014-10-20 22:04:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's the job?
2014-10-20 22:05:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know the location, but associate professor tenure track
2014-10-20 22:05:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe georgis?
2014-10-20 22:06:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*georgia
2014-10-20 22:06:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tom has a postdoc offer with Gunter Wagner
2014-10-20 22:06:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]did I tell you that?
2014-10-20 22:06:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he told me
2014-10-20 22:08:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't doubt people getting post-docs
2014-10-20 22:08:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's cheap labor
2014-10-20 22:08:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol
2014-10-20 22:08:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]faculty have to love post-docs
2014-10-20 22:08:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's super cheap high quality work
2014-10-20 22:09:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a post-doc is probably worth like 3 grad students
2014-10-20 22:09:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they get paid like $15k more than a single grad student
2014-10-20 22:09:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe I won't need to do a postdo, who knows?
2014-10-20 22:10:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much does a tenure track position pay starting out?
2014-10-20 22:10:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at a state school
2014-10-20 22:11:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that has to be public
2014-10-20 22:11:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm looking
2014-10-20 22:12:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$71,000
2014-10-20 22:12:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's a nice job
2014-10-20 22:12:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]there you go
2014-10-20 22:13:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think if I get a grfp or dod grant this year that would be encouraging
2014-10-20 22:13:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I honestly have no idea how these things work
2014-10-20 22:13:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it helps tremendously to be at UChicago
2014-10-20 22:14:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and shake hands with the right people
2014-10-20 22:14:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]networking

2014-10-20 23:06:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]she asked about my wedding dress
2014-10-20 23:06:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that also caused a sense of panic
2014-10-20 23:06:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why?
2014-10-20 23:09:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, because I don;t have any idea of what I want
2014-10-20 23:09:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and its one of those 'big decisions'
2014-10-20 23:10:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*mild panic would be more appropriate
2014-10-20 23:10:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-20 23:10:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've got plenty of time for that

2014-10-20 23:11:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]not that I think it will necessarily happen
2014-10-20 23:12:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but we should try    😃 
2014-10-20 23:12:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's gonna come up every time we roll

2014-10-20 23:12:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but maybe we can refrain while sober
2014-10-20 23:12:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha

2014-10-20 23:14:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's just the oxytocin talking
2014-10-20 23:14:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ha yeah I guess so
2014-10-20 23:15:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no way

2014-10-20 23:26:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we're just so damn perfect for ech other
2014-10-20 23:28:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm looking up the first times we mentioned "marry"
2014-10-20 23:29:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We all decided we would just  marry   rich haha Michael A. Alcorn Haha hell yeah, man. You could definitely find yourself a nice sugar daddy    😉 Katherine Silliman 😀
2014-10-20 23:29:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't implying me when I said that
2014-10-20 23:29:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-20 23:29:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think you took it that way
2014-10-20 23:29:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was May 4
2014-10-20 23:29:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]almost two months in, lol
2014-10-20 23:30:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's not really referring to us getting married though, is it?
2014-10-20 23:30:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't
2014-10-20 23:30:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't know how you interpreted it
2014-10-20 23:31:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]July 14th was when we talked about it in earnest
2014-10-20 23:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you were thinking about getting engaged
2014-10-20 23:31:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]" Not necesssarilyyyy with you ;)"
2014-10-20 23:32:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we had a mini debate over the proposal thing
2014-10-20 23:32:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was thinking about getting engaged in what context?
2014-10-20 23:32:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's chilly here! I'm gonna take a nap before ppl get back from work and I have to be social   Oh also, I thought about how I want to get engaged the whole way home hahaha Michael A. Alcorn hahahaha well shit like the setting and whatever? Katherine Silliman Not necesssarilyyyy with you    😉
2014-10-20 23:33:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we mustve talked about it in person before that
2014-10-20 23:33:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think the 1st time I went to Raleigh was when we talked about it
2014-10-20 23:33:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so
2014-10-20 23:34:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the "I want to have your babies and spend the rest of my life with you" stuff
2014-10-20 23:34:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's whatever, I already know I'm gonna marry you I'm gonna propose to you you're gonna love it you're gonna cry we're gonna live happily ever after
2014-10-20 23:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Katherine Silliman Is this how you were planning it, over Hangouts? Michael A. Alcorn yeah8:01 PM Katherine Silliman Well I am about to tear up haha

2014-10-20 23:34:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or were they the visit after this discussion
2014-10-20 23:35:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]when was that discussion?
2014-10-20 23:35:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]July 14th
2014-10-20 23:35:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you visited July 17th
2014-10-20 23:35:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it was the 1st raleigh visit
2014-10-20 23:35:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the end of june
2014-10-20 23:36:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah you're right
2014-10-20 23:36:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so only 3 months in lol
2014-10-20 23:36:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because in a message on July 9th I said "you've already told me you want to have my babies"
2014-10-20 23:39:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yup
2014-10-20 23:39:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]3 months and probably < 30 days physically with each other
2014-10-20 23:40:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep
2014-10-20 23:40:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]26 days
2014-10-20 23:40:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you include travel days
2014-10-20 23:40:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so probably closer to something like 20
2014-10-20 23:41:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hahaha man what a story
2014-10-20 23:41:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt
2014-10-20 23:45:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't believe I told you I wanted your babies after 26 days
2014-10-20 23:45:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you should've run away screaming
2014-10-20 23:45:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well it was 90 days of emotional development
2014-10-20 23:45:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which doesn't sound much better
2014-10-20 23:45:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-20 23:45:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I might've prompted you
2014-10-20 23:46:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I might've said it jokingly at some point
2014-10-20 23:46:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that same week
2014-10-20 23:46:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]probably
2014-10-20 23:47:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's not like it was completely out of nowhere if that was the case
2014-10-20 23:47:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you ever had moments of doubt?
2014-10-20 23:47:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, and obviously it was mutual
2014-10-20 23:47:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-20 23:48:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe for half a second after some of the disagreements we've had when apart
2014-10-20 23:48:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]not that we aren't perfect for each other, but that we might not make it to May
2014-10-20 23:48:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-10-20 23:48:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]have you?
2014-10-20 23:48:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]umm
2014-10-20 23:48:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I guess so
2014-10-20 23:49:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think that night we were going at each other on the phone
2014-10-20 23:49:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in late August
2014-10-20 23:49:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you were drunk
2014-10-20 23:49:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I didn't know
2014-10-20 23:50:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was probably the worst
2014-10-20 23:50:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what was the instigation for that?
2014-10-20 23:51:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure
2014-10-20 23:51:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the time you made the comment about fucking and adventures
2014-10-20 23:52:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]both of those things happened in August
2014-10-20 23:52:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]separate occasions, though
2014-10-20 23:52:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I remember the lego debacle
2014-10-20 23:53:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]was the other one just about texting?
2014-10-20 23:53:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably
2014-10-20 23:54:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-10-20 23:55:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-10-20 23:55:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you gonna check your snaps, woman?
2014-10-20 23:55:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]SHIT
2014-10-20 23:55:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that should be more like SHIIIIIIIIT

2014-10-20 23:56:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do those faces look like to you?
2014-10-20 23:56:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I typed them on my computer
2014-10-20 23:56:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so obnoxious
2014-10-20 23:56:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lol
2014-10-20 23:57:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Much cooler
2014-10-20 23:57:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol no
2014-10-20 23:58:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]dudeee come rub your face all over mine
2014-10-20 23:58:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and give me kisses
2014-10-20 23:58:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish
2014-10-20 23:59:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it's a good sign we haven't got tired of missing each other yet
2014-10-20 23:59:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]even though it'd probably be easier if we did
2014-10-20 23:59:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-10-21 00:00:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean we still say "I miss you all the time" and mean it
2014-10-21 00:00:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]even after 7 months of this
2014-10-21 00:01:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, yeah
2014-10-21 00:01:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it'd be easier for me if you didn't miss me
2014-10-21 00:01:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it'd be easier for me to not miss you as much
2014-10-21 00:01:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh I see
2014-10-21 00:01:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah that makes sense
2014-10-21 00:01:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but then I probably wouldn't be counting down the days to our nuptials
2014-10-21 00:01:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha exactly
2014-10-21 00:02:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but, like you said, it makes us have a greater appreciation for the time we have together
2014-10-21 00:03:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I think that'll be something we carry with us for the rest of our lives
2014-10-21 00:03:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so at least we have that!
2014-10-21 00:03:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]just happily ever after
2014-10-21 00:03:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]nbd

2014-10-21 00:20:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess TwoDots is more strategic, though
2014-10-21 00:20:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dots requires some reflexes
2014-10-21 00:20:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth

2014-10-21 00:22:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it makes me feel less lonely 
2014-10-21 00:23:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😞 
2014-10-21 00:23:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you sleep so good when I'm there

2014-10-21 00:23:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's the best sleep 
2014-10-21 00:24:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes I sleep ok when you're gone, but last night it probably took me an hour +
2014-10-21 00:24:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And like last Thursday I was up until 3a
2014-10-21 00:24:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I sleep OK when I feel like we're good
2014-10-21 00:24:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I sleep pretty bad when I don't
2014-10-21 00:25:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes being excited about you keeps me from sleeping 
2014-10-21 00:25:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I always sleep like shit right before I see you 
2014-10-21 00:25:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah that sucks
2014-10-21 00:25:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's pretty endearing
2014-10-21 00:25:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😴😴😴
2014-10-21 00:26:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]go to sleep
2014-10-21 00:26:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok stud, I'm going to fight the good fight 
2014-10-21 00:26:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You too, I'm sure you'll sleep well tonight :)
2014-10-21 00:26:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think so too
2014-10-21 00:26:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you
2014-10-21 01:21:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Somehow I lost my nose ring in bed
2014-10-21 01:21:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Playing dots 
2014-10-21 08:31:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh no!
2014-10-21 08:31:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How many nose rings have you gone through?
2014-10-21 09:04:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found it!
2014-10-21 09:05:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was on the bathroom floor
2014-10-21 09:05:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is the same one I had it pierced with 
2014-10-21 09:05:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wow, no kidding.
2014-10-21 09:05:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it must've actually fallen out when I washed my face and I just didn't notice until later lol
2014-10-21 09:06:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've had this almost 4 years
2014-10-21 09:06:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But for like a year it was missing in my room in Miami haha
2014-10-21 09:06:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-21 09:06:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]were you using a different one then?
2014-10-21 09:07:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wore a stud for most of that time 
2014-10-21 09:07:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then I found it stuck in the carpet when I moved out 
2014-10-21 09:07:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-21 09:09:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you got it in 2011?
2014-10-21 09:11:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah right after my 20th bday
2014-10-21 09:11:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when did you get your tattoo?
2014-10-21 09:11:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right around my 21st
2014-10-21 09:30:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only 3 more night bebe
2014-10-21 10:00:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm making a slow cooker pumpkin/carrot/turkey soup
2014-10-21 10:01:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]taht sounds tasty
2014-10-21 10:01:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you make a lot of slower cooker meals?
2014-10-21 10:02:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not a ton, because I basically have to eat leftovers forever
2014-10-21 10:03:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I feel like I'd make more living with you 
2014-10-21 10:03:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I typically like slow cooker meals
2014-10-21 10:03:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made this Moroccan lentil stew last year that was super fuckin tasty 
2014-10-21 10:04:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that sounds good too
2014-10-21 10:04:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are fucking mosquitoes in my room
2014-10-21 10:04:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I killed one last night
2014-10-21 10:04:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I just killed another one
2014-10-21 10:04:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I have bites on my arms and ankles
2014-10-21 10:11:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh I do not miss that 
2014-10-21 10:11:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was about to complain about it being a little chilly to get out of bed this morning 
2014-10-21 10:11:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that's 100x worse to me
2014-10-21 10:12:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha really?
2014-10-21 10:12:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it seems like our respective upbringings have influenced our feelings towards weather
2014-10-21 10:14:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How I grew up burning myself on seatbelts and you grew up in the cold?
2014-10-21 10:14:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-10-21 10:14:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A mosquito bit me on the eyelid once in my sleep and I woke up with a swollen shut eye 
2014-10-21 10:15:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ew
2014-10-21 10:15:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those are evil fuckers 
2014-10-21 10:15:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty effed up
2014-10-21 10:15:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My aunt is apparently not leaving her house until mosquito season is over 
2014-10-21 10:16:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except to go to the grocery store wearing gloves and a mask 
2014-10-21 10:16:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-21 10:16:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's a season is there?
2014-10-21 10:16:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They stop in December for a couple months 
2014-10-21 10:17:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I honestly haven't noticed them before the past few weeks
2014-10-21 10:17:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when I've found the random one flying around
2014-10-21 10:17:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Has it been raining?
2014-10-21 10:17:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-21 10:17:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's a lot cooler
2014-10-21 10:17:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was super hot for the first month and a half
2014-10-21 10:17:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It rained while you were visiting, didn't it?
2014-10-21 10:17:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-10-21 10:18:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The last hoorah 
2014-10-21 10:18:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Out for Delivery!!!
2014-10-21 10:18:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want you to stand by the door until it gets there
2014-10-21 10:19:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then text me immediately when you get it
2014-10-21 10:32:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a meeting at 11
2014-10-21 10:33:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just kidding.
2014-10-21 10:45:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wouldn't have been surprised if you were serious 
2014-10-21 11:59:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Rick Ree doesn't think the method I wanted to use is gonna work :/
2014-10-21 12:00:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what did he say?
2014-10-21 12:02:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's kinda hard to explain over text, I'll tell you later though. Basically I can't do some of the PopGen stats I thought I could
2014-10-21 12:02:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He's probably right though 
2014-10-21 12:04:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-21 15:05:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if people are going to think our costumes are a reference to our relationship?
2014-10-21 15:25:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In what way?
2014-10-21 15:26:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm your "holy grail"
2014-10-21 15:27:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol
2014-10-21 15:27:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If we start telling ppl we're getting married, maybe
2014-10-21 15:28:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]More likely we'll get jokes about the whip
2014-10-21 15:28:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha true.
2014-10-21 16:33:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Check yo snaps

2014-10-21 18:13:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Class
2014-10-21 18:53:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'll turn it on when I get home at 9:45 :)
2014-10-21 18:54:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds good
2014-10-21 18:54:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't remember what workouts I did last week
2014-10-21 18:55:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably because you didn't so that many 
2014-10-21 18:55:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah I still went to the gym twice
2014-10-21 18:55:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except for lifting me ;)
2014-10-21 18:55:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-21 18:56:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I lifted you up this past time?
2014-10-21 18:56:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess not
2014-10-21 21:50:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughh when we live up north I won't get home until like 10:15p
2014-10-21 21:50:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But then at least we'll have a parking spot 
2014-10-21 21:50:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from band?
2014-10-21 21:50:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah

2014-10-22 00:21:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's a meteor shower tn
2014-10-22 00:21:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You gonna try to watch it?
2014-10-22 00:23:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The Internet says you can see it in Michigan 
2014-10-22 00:23:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not nearly as fun to stay up late and be out in the cold alone though 
2014-10-22 00:24:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should take some pics for me though 
2014-10-22 00:25:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What?
2014-10-22 00:26:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go out and take some pics of the meteors 
2014-10-22 00:26:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh, nah.
2014-10-22 08:08:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's s high of 70 on Monday 
2014-10-22 08:36:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Downright tropical.
2014-10-22 08:40:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had a feeling something in Hangouts fucked up last night.
2014-10-22 08:41:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't get the two messages before "You should take some pics for me though"
2014-10-22 08:48:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well soon you'll have a new phone and those problems will be gone!
2014-10-22 08:48:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you more excited for the phone, or seeing me on Friday?
2014-10-22 08:48:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wait, better question:
2014-10-22 08:48:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you more likely to turn the phone on 1st or me 1st Friday night?
2014-10-22 08:48:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you shouldn't ask questions you don't want to know the answer to
2014-10-22 08:48:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-22 08:49:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you sent me a pic of the phone and your naked body I might insta-cum
2014-10-22 08:51:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'll just have sex while you're playing with my phone
2014-10-22 09:44:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not while you're playing with it? 
2014-10-22 09:44:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah we could do that
2014-10-22 09:45:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you tell me how fast and awesome it is
2014-10-22 09:47:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh my god 
2014-10-22 10:17:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you want anything else from goodwill? What were you going to do for pants?
2014-10-22 10:17:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you think I should do for pants?
2014-10-22 10:18:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jeans might be fine, unless you think you'll be too warm 
2014-10-22 10:25:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah that'll work
2014-10-22 10:25:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]were you really hot at last year's party or something?
2014-10-22 10:28:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah everyone was, but I think ppl were also more worried about noise so not all the windows were open 
2014-10-22 10:31:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you!
2014-10-22 10:36:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha random 
2014-10-22 10:36:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But obvs I love you too
2014-10-22 11:15:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You wear a med?
2014-10-22 11:15:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]L
2014-10-22 11:17:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you think we should get long sleeve?
2014-10-22 11:17:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's up to you
2014-10-22 11:17:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really care
2014-10-22 11:17:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhhhhh
2014-10-22 11:17:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-10-22 11:28:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is this totally boring?
2014-10-22 11:29:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I could cut off s sleeve
2014-10-22 11:31:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it looks like you're going to work
2014-10-22 11:33:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but a hat and a whip I think would make it pretty obvious
2014-10-22 11:36:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found a better shirt, but no jacket 
2014-10-22 11:37:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'll be fine without the jacket
2014-10-22 11:37:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what does the new shirt look like?
2014-10-22 11:37:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whiter and tighter 
2014-10-22 11:38:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]his shirty is tan
2014-10-22 11:38:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it doesn't matter haha
2014-10-22 11:38:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too bad
2014-10-22 11:38:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a hat and a whip is all you need
2014-10-22 11:42:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Next year if we do a couples costume, you're coming with me to shop
2014-10-22 11:43:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]am I frustrating you?
2014-10-22 11:44:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The whole process is frustrating me a little 
2014-10-22 11:44:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it'll be fine 
2014-10-22 11:44:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, I'm sorry. It's not a big deal! It's supposed to be fun.
2014-10-22 11:44:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]everyone is gonna like our costumes
2014-10-22 11:44:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you're gonna look sexy
2014-10-22 13:03:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to look like I'm going to work to murder ppl with a whip
2014-10-22 13:03:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But thanks honey
2014-10-22 17:12:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I remember the details of your traumatic sexual experience.
2014-10-22 17:13:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-10-22 17:13:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe rolling is not the best time to talk about that stuff after all
2014-10-22 17:37:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even know why it was brought up.
2014-10-22 17:37:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You asked me 
2014-10-22 17:38:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know that
2014-10-22 17:38:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but why did I ask you
2014-10-22 17:38:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]were we talking about something related?
2014-10-22 17:38:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why would I think about that?
2014-10-22 17:54:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm I don't remember, maybe we were just talking about sex in general?
2014-10-22 17:55:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd make sense I suppose
2014-10-22 17:55:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you asked for me to elaborate on why anal sex had complicated feelings for me
2014-10-22 17:55:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since I skipped over it the last time we talked about it 
2014-10-22 17:56:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I remember asking, but I guess I just don't know what prompted me, but I guess if we were talking about sex I can see that being the trigger
2014-10-22 17:57:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was pretty cathartic of me to talk about it with someone 
2014-10-22 17:57:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I don't really mind that you don't remember the specifics lol 
2014-10-22 17:58:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess it's just weird that I don't know them
2014-10-22 17:58:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]now
2014-10-22 17:58:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and like the other day when you asked if I didn't remember anything about our conversation
2014-10-22 17:58:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well
2014-10-22 17:58:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you usually black out stuff from when you roll?
2014-10-22 17:58:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it looks like I might not
2014-10-22 17:58:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know?
2014-10-22 17:59:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't black out
2014-10-22 17:59:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I remember Elin didn't spread the rumor
2014-10-22 17:59:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but she didn't stop it
2014-10-22 17:59:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I remember you jerked the kid off for a bit
2014-10-22 17:59:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but didn't finish him
2014-10-22 17:59:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't remember the actual story completely
2014-10-22 18:00:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't really want to tell it again over text 
2014-10-22 18:04:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Why were you thinking about that now?
2014-10-22 18:04:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there was a post on reddit about anal and "virginity"
2014-10-22 18:21:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Word
2014-10-22 18:45:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a cold :(
2014-10-22 18:45:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no sugar for you
2014-10-22 18:45:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and Darcy's sick too?
2014-10-22 18:46:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I should bail...
2014-10-22 18:51:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's feeling much better
2014-10-22 18:51:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And she thinks it had something to do with her flu shot 
2014-10-22 18:52:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My period also just started though, soo looks like not a lot of sugar regardless
2014-10-22 18:52:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whelp might as well cancel my flight
2014-10-22 18:53:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth 
2014-10-22 18:53:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though now I'm stuck with all of these goblets 
2014-10-22 18:53:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pirate party
2014-10-22 18:53:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]obviously
2014-10-22 18:55:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No one will come if I'm sniffling 
2014-10-22 18:56:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you planning on having this cold for the rest of your life?
2014-10-22 18:56:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-22 18:56:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes 
2014-10-22 18:56:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel poopy
2014-10-22 18:56:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😞 
2014-10-22 18:59:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I swear, there's something in my room that vibrates 
2014-10-22 18:59:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That isn't my phone 
2014-10-22 19:00:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you think it's your phone?
2014-10-22 19:00:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when it happens?
2014-10-22 19:01:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It sounds like a phone
2014-10-22 19:01:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're trippin'
2014-10-22 19:18:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like I'll be turning my phone on first this weekend
2014-10-22 19:35:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-10-22 19:44:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe we should have me visit next weekend?
2014-10-22 19:44:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you kidding?
2014-10-22 19:44:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha just floating the idea!
2014-10-22 19:45:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Up to you I guess 
2014-10-22 19:45:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's a $99 round trip on Spirit
2014-10-22 19:47:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is that what you want to do?
2014-10-22 19:47:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm open to it. I'd like your feedback.
2014-10-22 19:48:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not really sure how I feel about it. 
2014-10-22 19:49:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My 1st reaction is pretty unhappy that you don't see the value in spending time with me when we can't have sex the entire time, but I'm trying to be a little more rational than that
2014-10-22 19:50:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's your more rational take then
2014-10-22 19:51:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was looking forward to going to the Halloween party with you 
2014-10-22 19:51:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And seeing you 
2014-10-22 19:51:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I also realize the Halloween party doesn't mean anything to you except as an opportunity to do drugs 
2014-10-22 19:54:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We'll just keep the current arrangement then.
2014-10-22 19:55:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry
2014-10-22 19:55:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess my take is, if we're spending money to see each other, why not maximize that time together
2014-10-22 19:56:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd still be seeing you if I see you next week
2014-10-22 19:56:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we could still do Halloween stuff
2014-10-22 19:56:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as it will be Halloween
2014-10-22 19:56:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you hopefully wouldn't be sick then
2014-10-22 19:56:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure I'll feel better in a couple days 
2014-10-22 19:57:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess you have a point 
2014-10-22 19:58:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though next weekend will be pretty busy, since the GRFP is due the 6th
2014-10-22 19:58:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you weren't planning on doing anything for Halloween?
2014-10-22 19:59:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not as of right now
2014-10-22 19:59:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-10-22 19:59:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd take that bet
2014-10-22 19:59:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might do something that night of other ppl are 
2014-10-22 19:59:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Come next weekend then
2014-10-22 20:00:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Itll be more worth your money and time 
2014-10-22 20:00:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then you can watch the auburn game this weekend 
2014-10-22 20:00:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would it be more worth your money and your time?
2014-10-22 20:00:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not paying for it 
2014-10-22 20:01:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll use those flight funds for something next year 
2014-10-22 20:01:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so where do you stand now?
2014-10-22 20:01:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's up to you 
2014-10-22 20:01:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't care?
2014-10-22 20:02:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd prefer you to come this weekend, but I don't want you to come and regret it. And I think you'll have a better time the weekend after 
2014-10-22 20:02:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why do you want me to come this weekend if you think I'll have a better time next weekend?
2014-10-22 20:04:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because I'd have a good time with you this weekend, and my costume is even lamer without the holy grail part, and because I'm worried I'll be stressed next weekend 
2014-10-22 20:05:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-22 20:05:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And because I don't like moving a visit just because we can't have sex and you'll be grossed out by my snot 
2014-10-22 20:05:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But those aren't really logical reasons 
2014-10-22 20:06:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no they aren't
2014-10-22 20:06:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's fine
2014-10-22 20:06:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll visit this weekend
2014-10-22 20:07:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No let's switch it 
2014-10-22 20:07:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll dress up as a cat 
2014-10-22 20:07:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can be Indiana jones and the holy grail next weekend if you want 
2014-10-22 20:08:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why are you changing your mind now?
2014-10-22 20:09:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At this point, I think I'll be bummed either way. And if you switch it, there will be the least amount of irksome between us
2014-10-22 20:10:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What days/times are the spirit flights?
2014-10-22 20:10:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why would you be bummed either way?
2014-10-22 20:10:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I'll know you don't want to be at the party, and you won't want to snuggle with me and that will hurt 
2014-10-22 20:11:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I already knew you didn't want to go to the party 
2014-10-22 20:11:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when did I say either of those things?
2014-10-22 20:12:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've told me before if I was sick you wouldn't want to get close 
2014-10-22 20:12:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just giving you a hard time
2014-10-22 20:13:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not really, since you actually wanted to change your flight 
2014-10-22 20:13:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-10-22 20:13:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how can you conclude that?
2014-10-22 20:14:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You 'jokingly' say you might as well just cancel your flight 
2014-10-22 20:14:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then you say that you would actually rather change it 
2014-10-22 20:14:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you told me after Montana that if our positions were switched you wouldn't be nearly as friendly 
2014-10-22 20:15:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK, I'm not really sure what you're trying to prove here.
2014-10-22 20:16:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to try to kiss you or w/e and be shutdown because I have a cold 
2014-10-22 20:16:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I want you to come the next weekend 
2014-10-22 20:16:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't shut you down.
2014-10-22 20:19:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then why did you want to switch?
2014-10-22 20:20:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I told you, if we're trying to maximize our time together
2014-10-22 20:21:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then it might make sense to go there when we could have sex and you aren't sick
2014-10-22 20:21:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if you think we'd have more fun this weekend
2014-10-22 20:21:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then that's fine with me
2014-10-22 20:21:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you're gonna be stressed next weekend or whatever
2014-10-22 20:21:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this party seems important to you
2014-10-22 20:21:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'll go with you
2014-10-22 20:22:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, I think I'd have more fun this weekend. I don't think we will. 
2014-10-22 20:22:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-10-22 20:23:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think we'll have more fun this weekend. Which is why id rather switch it. I feel selfish making you come this weekend when it won't be as worthwhile 
2014-10-22 20:23:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude, I wasn't implying I wasn't gonna have fun
2014-10-22 20:23:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was floating the idea
2014-10-22 20:23:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to see what you thought
2014-10-22 20:25:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't say you won't have fun, just you'll have a more enjoyable time the following weekend. 
2014-10-22 20:25:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was conflicted, but now I agree with you 
2014-10-22 20:25:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you think you'd have more fun this weekend
2014-10-22 20:25:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm totally down with that
2014-10-22 20:26:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't like you telling me how much fun I would have
2014-10-22 20:26:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'd appreciate it if you didn't
2014-10-22 20:29:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean it makes sense, one weekend you get to have sex, the other you get to sleep next to someone coughing the whole night. Both weekends involve going out with the other person, but one of them can be wherever you want it to be. And one weekend requires you to miss almost the entire auburn game while the other we get to go see it at the alumni bar.
2014-10-22 20:30:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry if I offended you somehow by trying to figure out what would make you happiest 
2014-10-22 20:30:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause ultimately that will make me the happiest 
2014-10-22 20:30:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'll be happy seeing you either way
2014-10-22 20:31:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and if you really want to see me this weekend and go to this party
2014-10-22 20:31:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then we should do that
2014-10-22 20:31:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]all I was trying to do was make sure we had considered all the options
2014-10-22 20:34:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I considered it, and said I thought you should switch it. Why are you making this more difficult?
2014-10-22 20:34:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it sounds like you prefer this weekend and are guessing how you think I feel
2014-10-22 20:34:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and basing your decision on that guess
2014-10-22 20:36:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You said my reasons for preferring this weekend were t logical 
2014-10-22 20:37:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]only the incorrect emotional response
2014-10-22 20:37:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the "I don't want to be around you when we can't have sick"
2014-10-22 20:37:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]reaction
2014-10-22 20:37:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that you're having
2014-10-22 20:37:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's obviously not the case
2014-10-22 20:37:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*can't have sex
2014-10-22 20:38:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you have yet to explicitly contradict that emotional response 
2014-10-22 20:38:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do I really need to?
2014-10-22 20:38:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have we not discussed extensively the fact that we are going to get married?
2014-10-22 20:39:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes. And then you make it sound like you don't think it's worthwhile to spend time with me when I'm not my best.
2014-10-22 20:39:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The first time sexy conditions aren't ideal you want to switch it
2014-10-22 20:39:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How else am I supposed to feel?
2014-10-22 20:40:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't say I wanted to switch it
2014-10-22 20:40:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm bringing up the option
2014-10-22 20:40:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you seem to really enjoy sex
2014-10-22 20:40:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it seemed like a reasonable thing to do
2014-10-22 20:40:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not like I'm choosing to not visit you at all
2014-10-22 20:40:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'd just be switching visits
2014-10-22 20:41:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't have sex with you for like 75% of the time
2014-10-22 20:41:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I still love you
2014-10-22 20:41:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm perfectly happy visiting you this weekend
2014-10-22 20:41:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so let's do that
2014-10-22 20:41:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can cuddle you while you feel poopy and get you things that'll make you feel better
2014-10-22 20:44:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what I wanted 
2014-10-22 20:44:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then that's what we'll do
2014-10-22 20:45:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry
2014-10-22 20:45:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for what?
2014-10-22 20:47:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, this conversation, you seemed to be upset with me at one point even though I was trying really hard to not make this an argument 
2014-10-22 20:47:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And sorry for being on my period and being sick and being easily upset 
2014-10-22 20:49:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't have to apologize for that
2014-10-22 20:49:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not mad at you
2014-10-22 21:01:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just want snuggles ads
2014-10-22 21:01:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*snugglesss
2014-10-22 21:01:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll deliver all the snuggles you can handle
2014-10-22 21:03:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]only two more nights apart!
2014-10-22 21:08:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-10-22 21:09:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you kinda want me to be there to help you feel better?
2014-10-22 21:13:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-10-22 21:13:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that makes sense
2014-10-22 21:14:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That feels selfish though
2014-10-22 21:14:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe it is in a way
2014-10-22 21:14:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I like it
2014-10-22 21:14:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'd feel the same about you
2014-10-22 21:16:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just want to see you now 
2014-10-22 21:16:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too
2014-10-22 21:32:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]i'm watching the World Series
2014-10-22 21:33:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it got heated for a bit
2014-10-22 21:33:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's funny to think of grown men fighting over a baseball game
2014-10-22 21:44:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth 
2014-10-22 21:44:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm watching AHS now 
2014-10-22 21:44:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not ignoring you 
2014-10-22 21:46:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's fine. I'll leave you be.
2014-10-22 21:50:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you 
2014-10-22 21:50:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]love you too
2014-10-22 22:48:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dallas and Brett were really pissing me off tonight 
2014-10-22 22:48:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why's that?
2014-10-22 22:58:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're frozen
2014-10-22 23:45:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks again for hosting for this weekend, we made some of the decorations today and are pretty excited for it. We are a tiny bit concerned about it getting too packed, though. It was brought to our attention that a mass email with 70+ addressees was sent out about the party to non-Darwinians. I’m not sure if it was from one of you or your roommate, or just forwarded on independently. Obviously we’re ok with y’all having some of your friends come to the party too (especially since many of them are our friends as well!) but since we bought the alcohol planning around previous Darwinian Halloween turnouts we don’t want to run out, or have things become so crowded that no one can dance or move around. Hopefully it won’t be an issue, but in case the place becomes uncomfortably packed we’re considering having someone outside so as to not let additional people in. This would be a worst case scenario option. If y'all can think of a better idea, let us know! Otherwise, we’ll just keep our fingers crossed that it’s not an issue. See you on Friday.

2014-10-23 00:40:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I really only have like three days this visit
2014-10-23 00:41:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a couple hours Friday night
2014-10-23 00:41:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sat, Sun, Mon
2014-10-23 00:41:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Tuesday you're gonna be gone most of the day
2014-10-23 00:41:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I leave early Wednesday
2014-10-23 00:41:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you get 5 nights in bed with me 
2014-10-23 00:42:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Come next weekend. I'm over this conversation. Leave Tuesday morning at 9a. 
2014-10-23 00:42:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll work on the grant next week hard
2014-10-23 00:43:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll cancel your swa one
2014-10-23 00:44:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's midway, right?
2014-10-23 00:44:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-10-23 00:44:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll just come this weekend
2014-10-23 00:45:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No! You clearly want to come next weekend or you wouldn't have brought this up again 
2014-10-23 00:45:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want you to come this weekend. 
2014-10-23 00:45:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then cancel my flight
2014-10-23 00:46:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I don't visit next weekend it'll only be two weekends after that
2014-10-23 00:46:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So now you're not visiting at all?
2014-10-23 00:47:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why are you doing this? 
2014-10-23 00:47:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]doing what?
2014-10-23 00:51:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we've agreed on something and you bring it up again, making it clear that you don't want to be with me this weekend. Then, you say "Nevermind I'll just come this weekend."
2014-10-23 00:51:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And now acting like you won't come at all
2014-10-23 00:51:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what do you want? Just tell me straight
2014-10-23 00:52:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No more saying things like "I'll deal with it" 
2014-10-23 00:52:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's hard to say
2014-10-23 00:52:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to be there the weekend that is a better time
2014-10-23 00:53:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You said it didn't matter to you that I would be in class during the week
2014-10-23 00:53:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That you would just be happy seeing me as much as you could
2014-10-23 00:54:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and this whole conversation is making me feel like that sentiment isn't really the case anymore
2014-10-23 00:54:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you want to have fun
2014-10-23 00:54:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]which is fair
2014-10-23 00:56:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm coming this weekend.
2014-10-23 00:58:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]cool, and if we have a terrible time we'll keep that in mind the next time this case comes up
2014-10-23 00:59:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what case is that?
2014-10-23 00:59:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]all the reasons you wanted to switch in the 1st place
2014-10-23 00:59:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and the 2nd place
2014-10-23 01:00:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-23 01:00:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was so close to saying I didn't want you to visit at all
2014-10-23 01:00:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]which obviously isn't really true
2014-10-23 01:02:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]everything will hopefully be better when we see each other though, riht?
2014-10-23 01:04:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-23 01:07:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm such a fucking emotionally unstable person. 
2014-10-23 01:08:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]stuff really bothers you
2014-10-23 01:09:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'll be fine when I visit
2014-10-23 01:10:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even really know why this got so negative
2014-10-23 01:12:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I told you how I interpreted you bringing up the option when we talked earlier, and you responded saying you were perfectly happy coming this weekend and cuddling with me. And it was fine 
2014-10-23 01:13:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then who brought it back up?
2014-10-23 01:13:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I brought it up again to double check in light of the party disaster
2014-10-23 01:13:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then we settled that
2014-10-23 01:13:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you brought it up through texting 
2014-10-23 01:15:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just now
2014-10-23 01:15:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-10-23 01:15:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At 12:40a
2014-10-23 01:15:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-23 01:15:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're yanking me around, man
2014-10-23 01:16:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry
2014-10-23 01:16:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let's leave it be
2014-10-23 01:17:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But what if I can't get coke for this weekend? You've said at least twice now how disappointed you'll be 
2014-10-23 01:17:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I will be disappointed, but it won't be the end of the world
2014-10-23 01:19:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I'm. Not enough for you to have a good time 
2014-10-23 01:19:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what has ever given you that impressoin
2014-10-23 01:20:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You deciding which weekend to come based on what's happening over time spent with me. How you'll be disappointed if you don't do drugs at a party you're going to with me, as if going 'sober' would not be fun
2014-10-23 01:21:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm being stupid 
2014-10-23 01:21:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't really feel bad about that
2014-10-23 01:21:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the times I see you are the only times I have "fun" in my life
2014-10-23 01:22:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I don't think I'm a bad person for wanting to maximize that
2014-10-23 01:22:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'll probably do coke next weekend
2014-10-23 01:22:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I won't
2014-10-23 01:22:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll give you all the coke to take home with you 
2014-10-23 01:22:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even know when my next opportunity would be
2014-10-23 01:30:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pressure to always show you a great time, those are what's driving our relationship right now. 
2014-10-23 01:30:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you feel like you have to show me a great time every time we're together?
2014-10-23 01:33:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Doesn't matter, I'm going to bed. Goodnight 
2014-10-23 01:34:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it does matter
2014-10-23 01:35:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna try to not get bothered when you say stuff like that from now on
2014-10-23 01:36:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There is some pressure from you for us to do drugs
2014-10-23 01:37:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't have to do drugs
2014-10-23 01:37:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just have to find you drugs because these are the only times you can do them, with me
2014-10-23 01:38:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't realize you felt so much pressure to find the drugs
2014-10-23 01:38:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and do them
2014-10-23 01:38:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean obviously it's fun 
2014-10-23 01:38:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've rolled on your own several times this semester haven't you?
2014-10-23 01:38:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]2x
2014-10-23 01:39:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that's part of it. My drug history, or times I've recently done drugs, stimulates these conversations where you talk about how you wish you could do them and you've wasted your prime years and stuff
2014-10-23 01:40:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm ok with it, obviously it's fun doing them with you 
2014-10-23 01:41:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But there is this implicit pressure that's built up recently to make your life fun when we're together because you think it sucks otherwise 
2014-10-23 01:42:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm an emotional wreck though, and I keep promising myself I would stop talking to you when I get to this point, even if you push me
2014-10-23 01:42:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I broke it again and I'm sorry 
2014-10-23 01:44:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've had a history of self harm, I don't think you knew that. I'm actually a fucking crazy person. You shouldn't listen to what I say, you shouldn't care when I get upset. It just happens and it's no ones fault but mine. I just need to calm down when it does. 
2014-10-23 01:45:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm going to try to sleep 
2014-10-23 01:45:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can talk when you're here if you want 
2014-10-23 01:46:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-23 01:46:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know what to say to that
2014-10-23 01:49:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight 
2014-10-23 01:49:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight
2014-10-23 02:04:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was shitty to drop something like that on you right before sleep 
2014-10-23 02:05:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not shitty.
2014-10-23 02:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just hard to really respond to.
2014-10-23 02:17:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you just want to talk about it when I get there?
2014-10-23 02:17:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes 
2014-10-23 02:17:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-23 02:17:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't really want to talk about it at all but I guess I have to now 
2014-10-23 02:18:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was feeling really volatile when I typed that 
2014-10-23 02:18:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we don't have to talk about it
2014-10-23 02:19:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, you should have a complete idea of what you're getting into. 
2014-10-23 02:19:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-10-23 02:19:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not fair I let you go on thinking I'm this amazing person 
2014-10-23 02:20:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm kinda surprised you've been keeping something like this from me
2014-10-23 02:20:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's never a good time to bring something like that up when you're happy 
2014-10-23 02:21:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess not
2014-10-23 02:22:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry I've been such a mess tonight 
2014-10-23 02:23:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some of it is hormones, some of it is sick, most of it is just me I guess
2014-10-23 02:23:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's been intense
2014-10-23 02:24:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely start to see more parts of you
2014-10-23 02:24:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate texting 
2014-10-23 02:25:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It doesn't help 
2014-10-23 02:25:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes, I think that is clear at this point.
2014-10-23 02:25:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just stew in my own poison 
2014-10-23 02:54:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you
2014-10-23 08:00:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-10-23 10:13:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good luck on your test today 
2014-10-23 10:13:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]thanks, sugar.
2014-10-23 10:16:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't wait to see you 
2014-10-23 10:16:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't wait to see you too. I miss you so much.
2014-10-23 10:17:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]36 hours
2014-10-23 10:17:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless I'm running late and my phone dies 
2014-10-23 10:17:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha truth
2014-10-23 10:22:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When did you go rj sleep?
2014-10-23 10:23:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a little after 3
2014-10-23 10:23:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry 
2014-10-23 10:24:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it wasn't your fault
2014-10-23 10:25:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's debatable lol 
2014-10-23 10:25:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll sleep in on Friday though for sure 
2014-10-23 10:26:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Saturday?
2014-10-23 10:26:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-10-23 11:56:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]One of my tires is flat and now my legs are killing me.
2014-10-23 11:56:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh 
2014-10-23 11:56:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you take a bus with your bike back home? It would suck if the tire totally blew 
2014-10-23 11:58:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the tube is fucked up because I just inflated that tire.
2014-10-23 11:59:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That should be a cheap/easy patch though
2014-10-23 12:02:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah? I've never fixed a bike tire before.
2014-10-23 12:03:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me neither but I'm sure it's online
2014-10-23 12:03:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or it'd be really cheap to take to a bike place
2014-10-23 12:06:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I finished a grfp draft 
2014-10-23 12:08:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yay!
2014-10-23 13:18:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What in your opinion is the best font for a projected ppt presentation?
2014-10-23 14:23:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I usually just use whatever comes with the theme I pick.
2014-10-23 15:32:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jiffy lube lost the thing that reads the engine light code....
2014-10-23 15:33:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I have to go to autoZone now too
2014-10-23 15:38:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lame. I'm like dreading biking home. My legs are so tired.
2014-10-23 15:39:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Take the busss
2014-10-23 15:40:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'll take at least an hour.
2014-10-23 15:40:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How long would it take to walk the bike?
2014-10-23 15:43:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]52 minutes without a bike according to Google Maps.
2014-10-23 15:46:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you could do a little bit of both 
2014-10-23 15:47:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah! I love you and miss you 
2014-10-23 15:50:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too
2014-10-23 18:51:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd it go?
2014-10-23 18:51:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the bike ride?
2014-10-23 18:51:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the test
2014-10-23 18:51:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bike ride was exhausting
2014-10-23 18:51:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my thighs were burning
2014-10-23 18:51:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the exam went well I think
2014-10-23 18:52:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I got my Algorithms exam back
2014-10-23 18:52:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I actually did OK
2014-10-23 18:52:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]B+
2014-10-23 18:52:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of course you did

2014-10-23 18:55:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There might be a leak in a gas hoSe that's what's causing the engine light. 
2014-10-23 18:56:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how big of a deal is that?
2014-10-23 18:56:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or I didn't have my gas cap screwed all the way shut lol
2014-10-23 18:56:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to take it next week for them to run smoke through everything and check

2014-10-23 22:11:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At some places maybe 
2014-10-23 22:11:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know what you're saying, but it's all good.
2014-10-23 22:12:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was delivering it the wrong order I think 
2014-10-23 22:48:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you ever seen Trick or Treat?
2014-10-23 22:48:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no

2014-10-24 00:13:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so
2014-10-24 00:13:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-10-24 00:15:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I missed the football game 
2014-10-24 00:15:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which I guess isn't a huge deal
2014-10-24 00:15:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But my plane before coming home was to do laundry and watch the game 
2014-10-24 00:16:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*plan

2014-10-24 11:58:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice! That's productive.
2014-10-24 11:59:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The presentation is not that great lol
2014-10-24 11:59:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should've finished it yesterday
2014-10-24 11:59:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]eh. It's mostly about discussing ideas anyway.
2014-10-24 12:00:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]about to walk three miles to school    😞 
2014-10-24 12:01:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You could jog
2014-10-24 12:01:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Get a little exercise in :)
2014-10-24 12:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm carrying my bags and sweating like crazy.
2014-10-24 13:00:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Forgot to grab some socks and granola bars :(
2014-10-24 13:01:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like this weekend has all kinds of omens.
2014-10-24 14:02:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, don't hate on this weekend 
2014-10-24 14:10:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We need some positivity 
2014-10-24 14:15:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-10-24 14:16:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got a lot of feedback on my grant 
2014-10-24 14:17:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only now I have to actually do the rewriting 
2014-10-24 14:18:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's good!
2014-10-24 14:20:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cathy wants a new draft by Tuesday 
2014-10-24 14:21:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bleghh
2014-10-24 14:21:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should be able to let you know before you board if I can pick you up or not 
2014-10-24 14:24:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought you were for sure going to be able to?
2014-10-24 14:27:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't want to have to come early on Saturday 
2014-10-24 14:27:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure you don't either 
2014-10-24 14:27:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-10-24 14:28:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So if it does come down to stay a little later or come early I'd rather stay a little later. But I'll pay for your lyft/uber if I can't get you
2014-10-24 14:28:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's all good.
2014-10-24 14:30:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you take the bus?
2014-10-24 14:30:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-10-24 14:30:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's silly, you don't have a card 
2014-10-24 14:31:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hopefully it won't come to it, but if it does just take an uber to my house and I'll pay you back for it 
2014-10-24 14:31:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I do have a card, but I think I need to put money on it.
2014-10-24 16:03:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's warm enough to not wear a jacket!
2014-10-24 16:04:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could probably get away with short sleeves actually 
2014-10-24 16:08:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. Yeah it looks like it's gonna be pretty nice while I'm there.
2014-10-24 19:42:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Bus?
2014-10-24 19:45:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll pick you up!

2014-10-29 11:55:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you cursing at your computer next to me
2014-10-29 11:59:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha aw. I had to check my bag because I didn't hear that Dallas was boarding so I was one of the last people on the plane.
2014-10-29 12:00:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I forgot to take my camera out of my bag too :-\
2014-10-29 12:01:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh noo
2014-10-29 12:01:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it ok?
2014-10-29 12:02:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm waiting for my bag now. Hopefully it comes soon so I can catch the bus.
2014-10-29 12:05:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Were you just too wrapped up in your McDonald's?
2014-10-29 12:10:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't have McDonald's. You were the one taking about it!
2014-10-29 12:30:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well why did you miss your flight call?
2014-10-29 12:33:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was paying attention to the wing gate I guess. And I guess it was too loud for me to hear them.
2014-10-29 12:34:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Google Maps ETA is one hour and 42 minutes.
2014-10-29 12:34:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]dudeeeee take an uber
2014-10-29 12:34:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I probably should.
2014-10-29 12:34:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]worth the $17 or whatever it is
2014-10-29 12:35:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's around $25
2014-10-29 12:36:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]still worth it
2014-10-29 15:29:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that was a waste of two and a half hours
2014-10-29 15:30:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:(
2014-10-29 15:31:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like I'm skipping class!
2014-10-29 15:31:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-29 15:31:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gotta walk my bike 3 miles to the bike shop.
2014-10-29 15:31:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You couldn't get it patched?
2014-10-29 15:31:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Richardson is my least favorite city on the planet
2014-10-29 15:31:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I've been doing for the past two and half hours
2014-10-29 15:32:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're you on public transport for 2 hours?
2014-10-29 15:32:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I patched like six holes
2014-10-29 15:32:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pumped up the tube
2014-10-29 15:32:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhh
2014-10-29 15:32:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it seemed fine
2014-10-29 15:32:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]put it back in the tire
2014-10-29 15:32:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pumped it up
2014-10-29 15:32:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it goes completely flat
2014-10-29 15:33:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry 
2014-10-29 15:34:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Could you ask the dude at your house if he could give you a ride there?
2014-10-29 15:34:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, but he won't be home until later.
2014-10-29 15:34:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man I'm bummed
2014-10-29 15:34:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that didn't take long

2014-10-29 15:35:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how's your day going?
2014-10-29 15:35:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you can just order a new tire online? 
2014-10-29 15:35:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And just take the bus until it gets there 
2014-10-29 15:37:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do they come with the tube inside them?
2014-10-29 15:37:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really don't know enough about bikes to be relying on one for transportation
2014-10-29 15:38:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you tell where the leak was that caused it to go flat?
2014-10-29 15:38:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd have to take the tube out again
2014-10-29 15:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but apparently I couldn't tell while I was putting the patches on or else I would've patched it
2014-10-29 15:39:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you screw the cap all the way back on?
2014-10-29 15:39:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, but the cap doesn't keep the air in
2014-10-29 15:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's a valve
2014-10-29 15:41:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I were you, I'd wait on the bike adventure. It's already late in the day, and you're fed up with it.
2014-10-29 15:41:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need it fixed, thoughl
2014-10-29 15:41:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't get around without it
2014-10-29 15:42:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go tomorrow, some time when you can get a ride there. That way in case you have to walk back for some reason, you don't have to walk 6 miles.
2014-10-29 15:43:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ask Carl if he's free after class/work.
2014-10-29 15:43:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I guess I could do that
2014-10-29 15:44:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]MAN that is frustrating
2014-10-29 15:44:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my hands ache now
2014-10-29 15:44:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it's a giant fucking pain in the ass to get the tube out from underneath the tire
2014-10-29 15:45:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and back in
2014-10-29 15:45:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna find the fucking hole
2014-10-29 15:45:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and this stupid fucking shithead dog has been barking at me the whole time
2014-10-29 15:46:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what a little piece of shit
2014-10-29 15:46:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I've ever hated a dog before this one
2014-10-29 15:46:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't kick it 
2014-10-29 15:46:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It will only make it yap louder 
2014-10-29 15:46:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorry you're having such a shitty day my dear
2014-10-29 15:47:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good. 6.5 months
2014-10-29 17:09:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My day so far has been either writing or talking to ppl about my writing. So not particularly exciting lol
2014-10-29 17:11:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm getting my tube replaced. It takes like five minutes and costs $20. I should've just done this in the first place. Tubes only cost like $10, so I'll probably just replace it myself if this happens again.
2014-10-29 17:12:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I took the bus.
2014-10-29 17:12:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well now we know. I didn't realize tubes were so cheap!
2014-10-29 17:16:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's like riding on a cloud.
2014-10-29 17:18:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha

2014-10-29 23:34:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Am I getting a stocking?
2014-10-29 23:34:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm guessing like snowmen/nutcracker
2014-10-29 23:34:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-29 23:34:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you nailed it
2014-10-29 23:34:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can I bring my own stocking? Or would that be rude?
2014-10-29 23:34:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I cut out the second part of her message
2014-10-29 23:34:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah you can definitely bring your own
2014-10-29 23:35:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Make sure your mom wouldn't be offended 
2014-10-29 23:35:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll ask
2014-10-29 23:35:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've just had the same stocking since I was a baby
2014-10-29 23:35:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's cool
2014-10-29 23:35:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she said she's going go get you one eventually, though
2014-10-29 23:35:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-29 23:36:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess our family has rolled with multiple stockings
2014-10-29 23:36:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so like the one's we had when we were kids
2014-10-29 23:37:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are essentially a part of my parents' Christmas decorations now
2014-10-29 23:37:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and my grandparents had their own set of stockings for my family
2014-10-29 23:39:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm required to get an "Alcorn" stocking?
2014-10-29 23:39:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's kinda funny
2014-10-29 23:39:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're not required
2014-10-29 23:39:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just said you can bring your own
2014-10-29 23:40:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, I just meant how your mom said she'd get one for me one day anyways lol
2014-10-29 23:40:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess my mom might like my stocking to stay at home 
2014-10-29 23:42:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do what ya want
2014-10-29 23:43:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did I not take the picture of you cracking the whip?
2014-10-29 23:43:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I took the later ones?
2014-10-29 23:43:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know Jim took some of them
2014-10-29 23:43:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought he took that one and then you turned on burst

2014-10-30 10:35:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how cheap?
2014-10-30 10:36:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nassau was 370 round trip from Chicago 
2014-10-30 10:36:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cancun was $500 from Chicago, so probably much cheaper from Dallas 
2014-10-30 10:37:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Valentines weekend is like $100 more though lol
2014-10-30 10:37:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I'm seeing that
2014-10-30 10:37:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could use my points for my flight and we could split yours? 
2014-10-30 10:38:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where would we stay?
2014-10-30 10:38:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunnoooo

2014-10-30 10:47:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you're interested I can look around at some point
2014-10-30 10:47:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If only our anniversary wasn't spring break aka the most expensive time to fly south lol
2014-10-30 10:49:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah ummm I think we should just hold off and put some thought into what we want to do next year
2014-10-30 10:49:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and not be reacting to a deal
2014-10-30 10:49:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't even know they had a deal 
2014-10-30 10:49:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh you're just coming up with ideas?

2014-10-30 10:50:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well, yeah, we should talk about our options!
2014-10-30 10:51:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think Miami may be more expensive than some international places 
2014-10-30 10:51:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yo
2014-10-30 10:51:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should send this sappy letter to SWA about how our 15 month long distance relationship wouldn't have survived without them 
2014-10-30 10:51:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And try to get free shit

2014-10-30 19:23:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wish you were going out dancing tn
2014-10-30 19:24:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I could actually remember dancing with you 
2014-10-30 19:24:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-10-30 19:24:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't remember dancing with me at the party?
2014-10-30 19:24:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it didn't really happen that much
2014-10-30 19:25:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did we get a slow dance in?
2014-10-30 19:28:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do a little bit, but I remember dancing with Haley more
2014-10-30 19:29:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think we got a slow dance but I know I tried to request one
2014-10-30 19:29:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for some reason I feel like I remember slow dancing for a few seconds
2014-10-30 19:30:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe 
2014-10-30 19:40:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This "Lebron come home" business on snapchat is silly
2014-10-30 19:41:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha why do you say that?
2014-10-30 19:42:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno
2014-10-30 19:42:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Doesn't seem worthy of an entire snap story dedicTed to it
2014-10-30 19:43:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tell that to the people of Cleveland    😉 
2014-10-30 19:55:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think Flo has a stuffy nose
2014-10-30 19:55:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Her purrs sound squeaky 
2014-10-30 19:56:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw that's sad

2014-10-30 19:56:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She must've caught it from you 
2014-10-30 19:57:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did make out with her a lot
2014-10-30 19:57:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gasp!
2014-10-30 20:07:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't forget to put heat on your ear!
2014-10-30 20:07:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]i wish there was a way to do it that wasn't so drippy
2014-10-30 20:08:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need a heat pad
2014-10-30 20:08:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're usually so big though
2014-10-30 20:08:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Overkill 
2014-10-30 20:08:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Put a paper towel of hot water in a ziplock?
2014-10-30 20:09:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that might work
2014-10-30 20:10:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or hold a cup underneath 
2014-10-30 20:11:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When you going dancing?
2014-10-30 20:11:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Leaving at 9
2014-10-30 20:12:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool

2014-10-30 20:13:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How are you alive after living alone for so long?

2014-10-30 20:16:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like you were taken care of in previous relationships
2014-10-30 20:17:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This phone is so awesome. It's definitely improved my quality of life.
2014-10-30 20:17:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-10-30 20:17:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like being cooked for and stuff
2014-10-30 20:19:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah Hannah cooked dinner. I don't really know what other aspect I'd be taken care of in, though.
2014-10-30 20:20:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Throwing your flossing sticks away lol

2014-10-31 10:26:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would warmer weather really make you happier than seeing me everyday? Because if so, this relationship isn't really that strong after all lol
2014-10-31 10:32:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Think of all the cold weather snuggles!
2014-10-31 10:34:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need to get brainwashed into one of those people who prefers cold weather
2014-10-31 10:35:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe once you're here long enough you won't mind it 
2014-10-31 10:35:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then we'll go to Australia!
2014-10-31 10:35:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'll try and change my attitude
2014-10-31 10:36:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's going to take some effort
2014-10-31 10:38:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll donate however many blowjobs are necessary to aid the cause 
2014-10-31 10:39:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha I appreciate the effort
2014-10-31 10:39:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Both of the usps stores near me have the worst ratings/reviews I've ever seen 
2014-10-31 10:39:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm just going to go to ups on 53
2014-10-31 10:40:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do they say a bout them?

2014-10-31 10:52:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was really horny in general, which I think may have something to do with hormones after my menstrual cycle. 
2014-10-31 10:52:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I really like it when you touch me while you're inside of me 
2014-10-31 10:53:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I just love you so much it makes me scream ;)

2014-10-31 10:58:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad. It really makes me happy when you're having fun.
2014-10-31 10:58:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like pushing you in the wheelbarrow
2014-10-31 10:59:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😄
2014-10-31 11:00:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know how many men can say that about their partners and really mean it like you do 
2014-10-31 11:00:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hope a lot 
2014-10-31 11:03:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't believe it's only been two days since we've seen each other.

2014-10-31 11:15:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like candlelight and shit
2014-10-31 11:15:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at a restaurant?
2014-10-31 11:15:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-10-31 11:16:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good
2014-10-31 11:16:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love that you love being romantic with me
2014-10-31 11:16:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just like fancy food 
2014-10-31 11:16:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Psh
2014-10-31 11:17:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha good point
2014-10-31 12:03:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]$15
2014-10-31 12:04:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's steep
2014-10-31 12:04:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh well
2014-10-31 12:04:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I made like $70
2014-10-31 12:10:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's UPS?
2014-10-31 12:26:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-10-31 12:26:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A flat rate box from usps would've def saved like $8
2014-10-31 12:27:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I would've bern pissed to go over there and them not have one
2014-10-31 12:27:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good. Just glad it got sold and is all taken care of now
2014-10-31 12:28:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't worry about paying me back
2014-10-31 12:28:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can get dinner :)
2014-10-31 12:28:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok
2014-10-31 12:31:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Looks like I got part of my AmEx fee back, so it all cancels out anyway.
2014-10-31 12:34:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did the people at UPS see what you were shipping?
2014-10-31 13:46:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-10-31 13:46:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Were they not supposed to?
2014-10-31 13:50:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's probably fine. I've read enough stories of sketch shipping practices that I'm a little untrusting, but it's probably like the school shooting phenomenon where people think they are way more common than they are.
2014-10-31 13:51:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it's insured for $100 too
2014-10-31 13:52:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh word. That's all it's worth anyway.
2014-10-31 17:51:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'm going to westneats fir Halloween

2014-11-01 01:55:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying to play dots 2
2014-11-01 01:55:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha

2014-11-01 01:55:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]🌚
2014-11-01 10:36:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Had a really scary dream about choosing a wedding venue 
2014-11-01 10:36:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The place was haunted and elin got stabbed in the stomach 
2014-11-01 10:36:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]!!!
2014-11-01 10:37:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That is scary
2014-11-01 10:37:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What was the venue?
2014-11-01 10:37:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This creepy red brick hotel 
2014-11-01 10:38:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Was it during the wedding this happened or just scoping the place out?
2014-11-01 10:38:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But then at the end when I "killed" the ghost, everything burst onto flowers 
2014-11-01 10:38:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just scoping it out 
2014-11-01 10:38:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice. You freed all the tortured souls.
2014-11-01 10:39:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obvs
2014-11-01 10:39:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What were you doing up at 6:00 AM?
2014-11-01 10:40:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How do you know I was up at 6a?
2014-11-01 10:40:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The cats woke me up for food 
2014-11-01 10:40:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You shared that cheese story with me.
2014-11-01 10:41:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah 
2014-11-01 10:41:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was mostly highlighting the fact that 3 scoops of ice cream was 1 dairy serving 
2014-11-01 10:41:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if you have that 7 times a week your bmi is lower 
2014-11-01 10:42:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wtf?
2014-11-01 10:42:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha fat makes your body happy obviously!
2014-11-01 10:43:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]🍦🍦🍦
2014-11-01 10:43:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm gonna have ice cream for breakfast 
2014-11-01 10:44:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You go girl
2014-11-01 10:44:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want doughnuts.
2014-11-01 10:44:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cider donutssss
2014-11-01 10:45:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha
2014-11-01 10:45:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I might be legitimately sick.
2014-11-01 10:47:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uh oh :(
2014-11-01 10:48:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't believe you haven't gotten your flu shot yet, either 
2014-11-01 10:48:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never got one before.
2014-11-01 10:48:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you afraid of shots?
2014-11-01 10:49:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No.
2014-11-01 10:51:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Florence cuddles 
2014-11-01 10:54:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]She loves you.
2014-11-01 10:56:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's a poor substitute for you, I hate to say
2014-11-01 10:57:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks for videoing with me when I got home. It's nice to look forward to seeing your face 
2014-11-01 11:00:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]☺
2014-11-01 11:00:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just about to tell you I love you so much and I miss you!
2014-11-01 11:02:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually remember a moment of a dream last night.
2014-11-01 11:03:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah?
2014-11-01 11:04:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said something to you that was clearly indicative of us planning on spending the rest of our lives together in front of other people who might not know that.
2014-11-01 11:04:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I don't remember the details.
2014-11-01 11:04:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha it's a miracle it hasn't happened yet
2014-11-01 11:05:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't really recall ever hearing other couples talk about that stuff.
2014-11-01 11:06:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which might mean they don't talk about it or that they don't talk about it in front of other people.
2014-11-01 11:06:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haley would talk about how she was going to marry her last boyfriend 
2014-11-01 11:06:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obviously that was wrong 
2014-11-01 11:06:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh really?
2014-11-01 11:07:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Simon was asking about you on Thursday night and if you were going to move here and if was serious and stuff 
2014-11-01 11:07:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't tell him our marriage plans though lol
2014-11-01 11:08:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how did you answer?
2014-11-01 11:08:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I said you were moving here and we were still deciding about living together but we are crazy about each other 
2014-11-01 11:09:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw    😃 
2014-11-01 11:09:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha you're s dork 
2014-11-01 11:10:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've only told Elin we're planning on getting married?
2014-11-01 11:10:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've told haley that it's in the realm of possibilities 
2014-11-01 11:11:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've told Daniel that you may be his brother in law 
2014-11-01 11:11:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-01 11:13:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need you to make me some soup and cuddle with me
2014-11-01 11:16:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aww
2014-11-01 11:16:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What kinds of soup do you like?
2014-11-01 11:16:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like most soups I've tried
2014-11-01 11:17:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm always down for tomato or chicken noodle, though
2014-11-01 11:23:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you like coffee cake?
2014-11-01 11:24:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I've had it in a while, but probably.
2014-11-01 11:24:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like most sweets/baked goods.
2014-11-01 11:25:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should've bought DayQuil at the store 
2014-11-01 11:26:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's crazy how the cough suppressant works
2014-11-01 11:26:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it says it affects the part of the brain that causes the urge to cough
2014-11-01 11:27:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and is the exact same stuff in sleep aids
2014-11-01 11:28:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah?
2014-11-01 11:28:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-11-01 11:28:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's pretty suspicious
2014-11-01 11:28:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's a dissociative hallucinogen too apparently
2014-11-01 11:28:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh I knew that
2014-11-01 11:28:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I robotripped once in college
2014-11-01 11:28:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha really?
2014-11-01 11:29:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-01 11:29:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you told me about that actually
2014-11-01 11:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how would you even figure out that it has these effects
2014-11-01 11:31:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are there coughing mice?
2014-11-01 11:31:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sure
2014-11-01 11:31:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]my cat cougs and sneezes
2014-11-01 11:32:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]apparently it was really abused in the 1970s
2014-11-01 11:33:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder what that means
2014-11-01 11:33:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"abused"
2014-11-01 11:37:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]not taken for ts intended medical purpose
2014-11-01 11:37:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a really loaded word
2014-11-01 11:38:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like when you "abuse" adderall its when you take it recreationally
2014-11-01 11:38:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]true
2014-11-01 11:39:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why do people want to prevent other people from being in altered states so much?
2014-11-01 11:39:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless it's alcohol of course.
2014-11-01 11:41:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know
2014-11-01 11:41:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]alcohol keeps the people down, man
2014-11-01 11:41:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I have read conspiracy theories
2014-11-01 11:42:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]about how LSD might have made people buy into capitalism/materialism less
2014-11-01 11:42:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah me too
2014-11-01 11:42:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is why the government was so active in making it illegal
2014-11-01 11:42:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but what about pot?
2014-11-01 11:43:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does pot really alters people's persepective?
2014-11-01 11:43:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no, that's my point
2014-11-01 11:43:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they're making it legal
2014-11-01 11:43:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but it can make them humgry and impulse buy lol
2014-11-01 11:43:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but for a long time the govt opposed it
2014-11-01 11:44:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've actually heard that had a lot to do with racism and maybe the alcohol industry
2014-11-01 11:45:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the alcohol thing was recent
2014-11-01 11:45:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know how much they had to do with it initially becoming illegal
2014-11-01 11:45:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they've lobbied hard against its legalization recently
2014-11-01 11:45:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is absolutely hilariosu
2014-11-01 11:45:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes
2014-11-01 11:45:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]its so seethrough
2014-11-01 11:48:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haley has been hardcore flirting with brett recently, but then keeps talking about how she's not attracted to him at all, ect.
2014-11-01 11:48:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I've told her I really don't care if she hooks up with him
2014-11-01 11:48:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I guess she stayed the night over there last night
2014-11-01 11:49:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still don't care, but the whole lying about wanting to hook up thing is kind of annoying
2014-11-01 11:49:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how do you know she stayed there?
2014-11-01 11:49:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She just texted me
2014-11-01 11:50:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]saying she didnt want me to hear it from Dallas or someone else 1st
2014-11-01 11:50:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't really see the problem.
2014-11-01 11:50:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's just been denying that she's flirting with him or interested in him at all
2014-11-01 11:51:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so it feels disingenuous 
2014-11-01 11:51:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe she didn't want to make you upset?
2014-11-01 11:51:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then when she found out you didn't care she decided to go for it?
2014-11-01 11:51:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've told her I didn't care for a while
2014-11-01 11:52:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like we had a conversation about it wednesday because there was some texting post halloween party btwn them and she told me he disgusts her lol
2014-11-01 11:52:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but yeah, it's not really a big deal
2014-11-01 11:53:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess people's opinions can change
2014-11-01 11:53:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and context is important
2014-11-01 11:54:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so much incest in the department
2014-11-01 11:54:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]between you, Haley, Brett, and me we've got a nice little Eskimo family
2014-11-01 11:54:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you haven't hooked up with haley though?
2014-11-01 11:55:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no I guess I should
2014-11-01 11:55:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]actually it wouldn't matter
2014-11-01 11:55:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would definitely not be ok with that lol
2014-11-01 11:55:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Brett and I are already Eskimo brothers
2014-11-01 11:55:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and now you and Haley are Eskimo sisters
2014-11-01 11:55:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so if I got with Haley it wouldn't add a new connection
2014-11-01 11:56:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]true
2014-11-01 11:57:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have this recipe for fancy tomato soup
2014-11-01 11:57:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish you were here so I could make it for you
2014-11-01 12:19:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bought more ice cream at HPP because they were giving out samples and it was too good 
2014-11-01 12:35:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what kind of ice cream was it?
2014-11-01 12:36:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]bananas foster
2014-11-01 12:37:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-11-01 12:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just bought some doughnuts and a big bag of candy
2014-11-01 12:38:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my jeans smell like cat litter
2014-11-01 12:38:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or whatever it is that your apartment smells like
2014-11-01 12:38:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lol
2014-11-01 12:38:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]probably cat litter
2014-11-01 12:42:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you watching Miami?
2014-11-01 12:43:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A little bit 
2014-11-01 12:43:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also trying to type 
2014-11-01 12:43:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah
2014-11-01 12:52:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]must be a great game to be at for HC
2014-11-01 12:52:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're playing really well
2014-11-01 12:52:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you walk to the stadium from campus?
2014-11-01 12:55:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lol no
2014-11-01 12:56:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's at the stadium that the super bowl is played in
2014-11-01 12:56:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's almost an hour drive away
2014-11-01 12:56:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]holy shit
2014-11-01 12:56:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure that impacts attendance
2014-11-01 12:56:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]another reason why it's kinda ridiculous to give us shit for low turnout
2014-11-01 12:56:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]they have buses
2014-11-01 12:56:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still
2014-11-01 12:56:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty inconvenient
2014-11-01 12:56:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but you obviously can't drink or take stuff on them
2014-11-01 12:57:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and if you want to tail gate its $20 parking
2014-11-01 12:57:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeesh
2014-11-01 12:57:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah that's a completely different experience
2014-11-01 12:57:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the frats take school buses, and so if you're a female you can ride with them and drink on the bus
2014-11-01 12:58:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but most of my friends were dudes not in frats so I didnt do it that often
2014-11-01 12:58:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you go to a lot of games?
2014-11-01 12:58:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]probably 80% of home games
2014-11-01 12:58:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-11-01 12:59:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]once I was a senior my friends and I took turn carpooling to tailgates
2014-11-01 12:59:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]except apparently my car has a foldout table!
2014-11-01 12:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That could've come in handy
2014-11-01 12:59:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha for sure
2014-11-01 13:01:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we should go to homecoming next year
2014-11-01 13:01:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]especially if it falls on a weekend of snow in Chicago again
2014-11-01 13:01:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-01 13:01:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be fun
2014-11-01 13:02:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so the tailgating happens at the stadium?
2014-11-01 13:02:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's sort of like how pro games work
2014-11-01 13:02:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like it'd be a very different experience
2014-11-01 13:02:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah it feels like a pro tailgate
2014-11-01 13:02:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like Auburn's campus is just one big tailgate
2014-11-01 13:02:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]people go all out for it
2014-11-01 13:04:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually went to a lot of games by myself.
2014-11-01 13:05:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my friend circle didn't really go to games.
2014-11-01 13:05:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why?
2014-11-01 13:05:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I didn't have a lot of friends to begin with.
2014-11-01 13:06:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But Dar and his friends just preferred staying at home and continuing the party I guess.
2014-11-01 13:06:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really remember many games now that I think about it.
2014-11-01 13:07:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I probably only missed a couple shitty ones.
2014-11-01 13:09:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]did autumn not like going to games?
2014-11-01 13:10:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we must've went to games together, but I don't really remember for some reason.
2014-11-01 13:10:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But we were dating for two seasons.
2014-11-01 13:11:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I only remember being at the game we lost to USF in OT with her and the game against WVU my senior year when it rained and we had already broken up.
2014-11-01 13:11:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess that was a long time ago for you lol
2014-11-01 13:12:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true, but you'd think I remember more since I like Auburn football so much
2014-11-01 13:15:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm definitely going to go to a bowl game when I have some money.
2014-11-01 13:15:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]for sure
2014-11-01 14:48:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]woooooo
2014-11-01 14:49:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you gonna go to the alumni bar next weekend?
2014-11-01 14:49:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we have a bye
2014-11-01 14:50:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah the FSU game is the weekend I'm there
2014-11-01 14:50:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hopefully the games are at different tims
2014-11-01 14:50:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Imma be pissed at the football scheduling gods if they arent
2014-11-01 14:54:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to cum in your mouthhhhh
2014-11-01 14:54:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hahaha
2014-11-01 14:54:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and you say I bring up sex all the time
2014-11-01 15:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://chemicalkinetics.tumblr.com/post/10321083039/blua
2014-11-01 15:37:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why are you on my tumblr?
2014-11-01 15:37:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]also I still think this picture is great
2014-11-01 15:39:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was trying to see whether my perception that you talk/think about sex more than other people I know is accurate
2014-11-01 15:40:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why do you think that picture is great?
2014-11-01 15:40:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]they look like they're having fun
2014-11-01 15:42:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and tumblr is arguably not representative of how often I bring up sex because I used it specifically to post interesting things I stumbled on from the internet that were not appropriate to post elsewhere
2014-11-01 15:42:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wouldn't that make it more representative?
2014-11-01 15:43:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the fact that you post a picture like that on the same blog you post pics of yourself makes me think you're not concerned about appropriateness
2014-11-01 15:43:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or weren't
2014-11-01 15:50:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess my mother isnt going to find my tumblr
2014-11-01 15:54:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I probably do talk about sex a lot more than anyone else you know
2014-11-01 15:55:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]also I talk about sex to you specifically 100x more than I do to anyone else (the occasional postings of my 20 yr old self not withstanding)
2014-11-01 15:55:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don;t really see why it matters
2014-11-01 15:56:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it doesn't
2014-11-01 15:57:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was trying to see whether or not I was accurate
2014-11-01 15:57:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so would you do something like in that picture?
2014-11-01 15:57:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you've done semi-public sex
2014-11-01 15:57:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe the naked dancing part
2014-11-01 15:57:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've never had sex in front of other people
2014-11-01 15:58:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's why I said semi-public
2014-11-01 15:58:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've had sex privately in public places, sure
2014-11-01 15:58:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where people could find you, though
2014-11-01 15:58:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was only "private" because no one else showed up
2014-11-01 15:59:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that is pretty close to giving a guy a blow job while surrounded by naked instrumentalists lol
2014-11-01 15:59:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean I don't know
2014-11-01 15:59:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you're implying it's not for you
2014-11-01 16:00:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know where your personal lines are
2014-11-01 16:00:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even though I feel like I tell them to you fairly often haha
2014-11-01 16:00:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I certainly wouldn't feel comfortable doig something like that with strangers, or people I wasn't really comfortable with
2014-11-01 16:01:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I don't know enough people now that fill that category
2014-11-01 16:06:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I sent you my 2 essays for the GRFP
2014-11-01 16:06:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you think you'll have time to look at them before mondsy morning?
2014-11-01 16:06:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could do it now I suppose
2014-11-01 16:08:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]up to you
2014-11-01 16:08:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or if you want to get just one of them back today that'd be cool too
2014-11-01 16:36:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]look fine to me
2014-11-01 16:36:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really think it's OK to call middle-school aged females women
2014-11-01 16:36:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was told last year to call them women
2014-11-01 16:37:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]by who?
2014-11-01 16:37:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the dept heads
2014-11-01 16:37:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]in the grfp class
2014-11-01 16:37:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would they call middle school aged boys men?
2014-11-01 16:38:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]" After becoming a research assistant my freshman
year; however, I discovered an unexpected satisfaction in meticulous and
methodical “lab bench” science." 
2014-11-01 16:38:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not a good spot for a semicolon.
2014-11-01 16:38:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a semicolon is basically a period
2014-11-01 16:38:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think that's gramatically correct
2014-11-01 16:38:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guarantee it's not
2014-11-01 16:39:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll just take out however entirely
2014-11-01 16:39:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and taking out the semicolon?
2014-11-01 16:41:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's the agenda with calling girls women?
2014-11-01 16:42:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that supposed to empower them?
2014-11-01 16:43:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll change it to young women if you'd prefer
2014-11-01 16:43:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess 13-18 year olds are an awkward bracket
2014-11-01 16:43:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]middle school is like 11-14
2014-11-01 16:43:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to me
2014-11-01 16:44:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can see calling a 14 year old a young woman I guess
2014-11-01 16:44:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but 11-13
2014-11-01 16:44:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like girls to me
2014-11-01 16:44:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really care
2014-11-01 16:44:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just wondering why they told you to change it
2014-11-01 16:44:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like what's the political motivation
2014-11-01 16:44:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know
2014-11-01 16:44:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]better be safe than sorry and piss someone off by caliing them girls
2014-11-01 16:45:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just don't understand why that would piss someone off
2014-11-01 16:45:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]isn't that sexist in some way?
2014-11-01 16:45:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if it would piss the moff?
2014-11-01 16:45:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you have other comments about my papers?
2014-11-01 16:46:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-11-01 16:46:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]really?
2014-11-01 16:46:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]from both papers you only had 1 grammar edit?
2014-11-01 16:47:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like you don't use my changes.
2014-11-01 16:47:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I always do
2014-11-01 16:47:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I was only looking for glaring stuff.
2014-11-01 16:47:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]extensively so
2014-11-01 16:48:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]where do you get that from?
2014-11-01 16:48:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are entire sentences that I know I've pointed out as seeming weird to me in other grants
2014-11-01 16:48:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that look the same
2014-11-01 16:49:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I rewrote a number of sentences in my Hinds based on your recommendations
2014-11-01 16:49:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe not every single recommendation, but most of them
2014-11-01 16:50:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And this has very few if any sentences directly from my Hinds
2014-11-01 16:50:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But w/e, if you don't want to its fine
2014-11-01 21:51:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was an icky ending 
2014-11-01 21:51:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I don't feel very good about that one.
2014-11-01 21:52:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to?
2014-11-01 21:55:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At the pub
2014-11-01 21:55:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For Laura's going away party 
2014-11-01 21:55:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where's she going away to?
2014-11-01 21:58:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Peru
2014-11-01 21:58:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To collect butterflies!
2014-11-01 21:58:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh Southcott
2014-11-01 22:00:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-11-01 23:26:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On my way home 
2014-11-01 23:26:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to?
2014-11-01 23:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not much
2014-11-01 23:26:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cooool
2014-11-01 23:28:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you watch the game at home?
2014-11-01 23:29:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeppp
2014-11-01 23:31:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I only really saw the last quarter 
2014-11-01 23:31:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How did auburn play?
2014-11-01 23:34:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]our offense was pretty good
2014-11-01 23:34:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]our defense was terrible
2014-11-01 23:35:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty frustrating to watch
2014-11-01 23:35:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think I'm getting used to it at this point
2014-11-01 23:35:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a little
2014-11-01 23:35:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it bad coaching?
2014-11-01 23:35:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or a smaller talent pool?
2014-11-01 23:36:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure
2014-11-01 23:36:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]coaching is definitely a part of it
2014-11-01 23:36:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm not sure how big of a part
2014-11-01 23:36:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was the pub?
2014-11-01 23:36:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fun, pretty chill 
2014-11-01 23:37:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haley came over before for dinner and some pot smoking 
2014-11-01 23:37:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The pub had a lot of "science talk" though, which she has a lower tolerance for than me
2014-11-01 23:38:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what
2014-11-01 23:39:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just meant she was bored and frustrated with the conversations there
2014-11-01 23:39:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah OK
2014-11-01 23:39:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And was not so subtlety expressing her displeasure
2014-11-01 23:40:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-11-01 23:40:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still haven't seen you stoned as far as I know
2014-11-01 23:40:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you do?
2014-11-01 23:41:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was stoned with you the other day 
2014-11-01 23:41:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]After the Halloween party 
2014-11-01 23:41:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't really that high
2014-11-01 23:41:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really? 
2014-11-01 23:41:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I definitely felt it
2014-11-01 23:41:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I took some other hits after you stopped 
2014-11-01 23:41:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was in a good place
2014-11-01 23:46:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mostly get extra goofy
2014-11-01 23:47:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't remember noticing anything the day after the Halloween party
2014-11-01 23:47:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I've seen you drunk several times now
2014-11-01 23:48:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and rolling obviously
2014-11-01 23:48:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't know what you're like stoned
2014-11-01 23:49:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We talked about our love for cheese and crackers for like 10 minutes 
2014-11-01 23:49:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have zero recollection of that
2014-11-01 23:49:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha really? When we ate lunch 
2014-11-01 23:49:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like I was high
2014-11-01 23:49:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha you definitely seemed high 
2014-11-01 23:50:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was fun 
2014-11-01 23:50:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what did we have for lunch?
2014-11-01 23:50:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh
2014-11-01 23:50:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I remember now
2014-11-01 23:50:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or do I
2014-11-01 23:50:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sitting at the table?
2014-11-01 23:50:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Breakfast tacos 
2014-11-01 23:50:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-11-01 23:50:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-11-01 23:50:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]shredding cheese and stuff
2014-11-01 23:50:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't really high at all at that point
2014-11-01 23:51:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also my reticence to leave the bed was pretty stereotypical high Katherine 
2014-11-01 23:51:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]making the eggs straightened me out
2014-11-01 23:51:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I can see that
2014-11-01 23:51:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-11-01 23:51:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's not too different from you
2014-11-01 23:52:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I'm really different/fucked up when I'm stoned 
2014-11-01 23:52:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless I've been drinking a lot too
2014-11-01 23:52:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-11-01 23:52:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I remember being giggly for a bit
2014-11-01 23:52:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in bed
2014-11-01 23:53:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't remember about what
2014-11-01 23:53:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I remember thinking
2014-11-01 23:53:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We were pretty giggly 
2014-11-01 23:53:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"I'm giggling because I'm stoned"
2014-11-01 23:54:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You could've also been giggling because you love me and stuff 
2014-11-02 00:50:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, goodnight 
2014-11-02 00:50:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-11-02 13:02:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In my personal statement, do you think I should put inevitably in paratheses?
2014-11-02 13:02:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm actually not sure how I feel about that sentence anymore.
2014-11-02 13:02:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was trying to make it sort of lighthearted
2014-11-02 13:02:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it sounds kinda cocky
2014-11-02 13:02:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-02 13:03:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if it comes across that way
2014-11-02 13:03:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was meant to sound naive
2014-11-02 13:03:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah I see that
2014-11-02 13:03:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not sure it quite works though
2014-11-02 13:03:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-11-02 13:03:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean that's sort of me projecting my personality anyway
2014-11-02 13:03:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think
2014-11-02 13:03:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know exactly what you were going for
2014-11-02 13:03:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I might write
2014-11-02 13:04:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which would (of course!)
2014-11-02 13:04:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]something lighthearted and naive, for sure
2014-11-02 13:04:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that kinda sounds like I'm mocking the certainty of getting a job
2014-11-02 13:05:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-11-02 13:05:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]again me projecting
2014-11-02 13:08:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can I say "Aspired to become a PhD in Marine biology"?
2014-11-02 13:08:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you become a PhD?
2014-11-02 13:08:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you earn a PhD
2014-11-02 13:08:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'd become a doctor of marine biology
2014-11-02 13:09:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but no one says that
2014-11-02 13:09:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well
2014-11-02 13:09:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess PhD is doctor of philosophy
2014-11-02 13:09:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Prior to entering college, I aspired to become a
marine biologist in order to legitimize a lifetime of SCUBA diving in exotic locales
while discovering new species. 
2014-11-02 13:10:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]legitimize?
2014-11-02 13:11:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like to make scuba diving a creer
2014-11-02 13:11:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*career
2014-11-02 13:11:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]not a hobby?
2014-11-02 13:15:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what're you up to today?
2014-11-02 13:15:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not much. Working on homework all day probably.
2014-11-02 13:15:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sorry, I can't come up with anything for that sentence.
2014-11-02 13:19:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]in the proposal you said to lowercase "Spring 2014"
2014-11-02 13:19:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]should I do the same in the personal?
2014-11-02 13:20:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-02 13:35:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]miss you
2014-11-02 13:35:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]miss you too
2014-11-02 13:36:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]did you fall asleep around midnight last night?
2014-11-02 13:36:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-02 13:36:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]about 12:30 probably
2014-11-02 13:51:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you stopped texting meee
2014-11-02 13:52:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe you stopped texting me!
2014-11-02 13:56:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I sent the last text of the night
2014-11-02 13:56:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]a lovey doveyish one, too
2014-11-02 13:57:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I didn't interpret it that way
2014-11-02 13:59:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's all good
2014-11-02 15:31:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just submitted the grfp
2014-11-02 15:32:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice, feel good?
2014-11-02 15:32:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It does
2014-11-02 15:32:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Now I can fully freak out over my lab work lol
2014-11-02 15:32:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-11-02 16:12:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need to learn how to use MySQL
2014-11-02 16:12:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah?
2014-11-02 16:12:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What for?
2014-11-02 16:12:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]apparently
2014-11-02 16:12:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]for playing around with genomes
2014-11-02 16:14:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm I'm not really sure of a good resource for it
2014-11-02 16:15:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe this -->  http://www.sqlcourse.com/
2014-11-02 16:16:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what is it
2014-11-02 16:16:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what is what
2014-11-02 16:16:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or this -->  https://www.udemy.com/mysql-database-for-beginners2/
2014-11-02 16:17:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the second one looks ok
2014-11-02 16:17:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what is mysql
2014-11-02 16:17:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]a language?
2014-11-02 16:17:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]a website?
2014-11-02 16:17:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's a database framework
2014-11-02 16:17:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]SQL
2014-11-02 16:17:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is structured query language
2014-11-02 16:18:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is a language for querying relational databases
2014-11-02 16:18:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]of which MySQL is a type
2014-11-02 16:18:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ah
2014-11-02 16:23:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's interesting
2014-11-02 16:23:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'll have to show me what you're doing with it someday
2014-11-02 16:23:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah I think you'll have to help me a little bit
2014-11-02 16:24:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]this group at UW has all these genomic resources for oysters
2014-11-02 16:24:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and have some instructions for how to look at them, but they're not that great
2014-11-02 16:24:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and also their labelling of files and stuff is super not helpful
2014-11-02 16:25:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]whats the point of having open science if you don't explain what all the files are??
2014-11-02 16:25:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]very good point!
2014-11-02 16:26:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What I want to do, is to take a genome and look for every occurence of a 6bp restriction site
2014-11-02 16:26:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]which I think I actually know how to do myself
2014-11-02 16:27:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]by I don't quite understand what the files are that have the genome on them or how they're organized
2014-11-02 16:27:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and since they're so big I don't want to just open them and scroll around looking for breaks or w/e
2014-11-02 16:28:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could write a Python script
2014-11-02 16:29:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it'd probably take forever
2014-11-02 16:29:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well
2014-11-02 16:29:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah it'd take 6 * size of the genome
2014-11-02 16:29:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if there are smarter ways to do that
2014-11-02 16:29:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how big is the genome?
2014-11-02 16:30:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]4.5 mp
2014-11-02 16:30:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sooo 27 million computations
2014-11-02 16:30:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that wouldn't take very long
2014-11-02 16:30:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]actually I don't know what mp
2014-11-02 16:30:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is
2014-11-02 16:30:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I assumed million base pairs
2014-11-02 16:31:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-11-02 16:31:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]mbp
2014-11-02 16:32:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I don't know how the base pairs are organized
2014-11-02 16:32:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think they are just a string
2014-11-02 16:32:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-11-02 16:32:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can't look in the file?
2014-11-02 16:32:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]use like less
2014-11-02 16:32:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from the terminal
2014-11-02 16:32:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if it's a text file
2014-11-02 16:35:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sr320/ipython_nb/blob/master/OlyO_PacBio.ipynb
2014-11-02 16:36:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is what they have for their preliminary genome
2014-11-02 16:36:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so like a bunch of 10 kb sequences
2014-11-02 16:37:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]holy fuck this shit is gnarly
2014-11-02 16:37:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like WTF is happening
2014-11-02 16:37:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-02 16:38:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]exactly!
2014-11-02 16:38:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I emailed them
2014-11-02 16:38:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]saying I wanted to use it but was unsure how to
2014-11-02 16:39:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like I think this is one of the 10k sequences
2014-11-02 16:39:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://eagle.fish.washington.edu/cnidarian/OlyO_Pat_PacBio_10k.fa
2014-11-02 16:40:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]don't ask me why the word "cnidarian" is in the title
2014-11-02 16:41:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-11-02 16:41:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or maybe this is all of them?
2014-11-02 16:41:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah this is essentially the genome
2014-11-02 16:41:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]broken up into 10k pieces, and unordered
2014-11-02 16:42:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why are they unordered?
2014-11-02 16:43:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I don't know that for sure, but the way PacBio works is you just chop up the genome, sequence the fragments, and then make these "contigs" of the fragments
2014-11-02 16:43:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think gives you overlapping sequences so you can order them 
2014-11-02 16:44:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well you could write a little script to do what you want I think
2014-11-02 16:44:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-11-02 16:44:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you have the data you need
2014-11-02 16:44:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just need to know for sure if the contigs could possibly be overlapping
2014-11-02 16:45:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]because then it would inflate the number of restriction sites
2014-11-02 16:45:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-02 16:57:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Off to play GoT tonight 
2014-11-02 16:58:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cooool
2014-11-02 16:58:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have fun
2014-11-02 16:59:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]More likely to lose some friendships lol 
2014-11-02 16:59:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]People get way too heated about this game
2014-11-02 17:00:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]shit's important
2014-11-02 17:00:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're important 
2014-11-02 17:01:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😒 
2014-11-02 17:20:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha why a sad face?
2014-11-02 17:20:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not really a sad face
2014-11-02 17:20:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it looks like it's rolling it's eyes kinda
2014-11-02 17:24:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I guess I see that 
2014-11-02 17:24:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe it's clearer with your lame emojis
2014-11-02 17:25:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😒😒😒😒😒😒
2014-11-02 17:27:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😏😏😏😏😏😏
2014-11-02 17:27:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-11-02 17:27:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]perfect
2014-11-02 22:09:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my dream involved sex stuff with my butt
2014-11-02 22:09:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-11-02 22:12:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the thing to join disappeared for some reason
2014-11-02 22:12:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nevermind
2014-11-02 22:13:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]another funny thing is that I ejaculated really hard

2014-11-02 23:14:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sorry
2014-11-02 23:50:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you still awake?
2014-11-02 23:50:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]chyeah
2014-11-03 00:24:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm going to tape a picture of your face on my wall
2014-11-03 00:24:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha oh yeah? Just cuz I'm so pretty?
2014-11-03 00:25:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I can better imagine snuggles
2014-11-03 00:26:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha, sometimes I think you're only in this relationship for the snuggles
2014-11-03 00:28:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well that's obviously not true, or else I wouldn't like talking on the phone so much with you 
2014-11-03 00:29:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sometimes you gotta make sacrifices for the things you want ;-)
2014-11-03 00:30:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're right 
2014-11-03 00:30:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm also in it for the mind-blowing orgasms 
2014-11-03 00:31:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And to use your genes to have incredibly attractive and talented offspring 
2014-11-03 00:31:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-11-03 00:31:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-11-03 00:31:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So so so much 
2014-11-03 00:31:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you!
2014-11-03 00:32:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you a ton.
2014-11-03 00:32:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too 
2014-11-03 00:32:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It hurts a little 
2014-11-03 00:32:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know :(
2014-11-03 00:32:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Aches is maybe a more appropriate word 
2014-11-03 00:33:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I can see that.
2014-11-03 00:33:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate every couple I see 
2014-11-03 00:33:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You just make be so incredibly happy
2014-11-03 00:33:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha aw
2014-11-03 00:34:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Okkkk
2014-11-03 00:34:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Darling 
2014-11-03 00:34:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love of my life 
2014-11-03 00:34:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight 
2014-11-03 00:34:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:( ok
2014-11-03 00:34:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nooo don't do a sad face 
2014-11-03 00:34:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want loving and kisses
2014-11-03 00:34:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to break the connection either 
2014-11-03 00:35:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want all the loving 
2014-11-03 00:36:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweet dreams. I love you with every ounce of me.
2014-11-03 00:42:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]💘
2014-11-03 09:02:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]apparently the Hangouts data I was downloading wasn't complete
2014-11-03 09:03:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I see
2014-11-03 09:03:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I downloaded it two more times and on the third time changed the archive format to .tgz rather than .zip and eventually got all our conversation data
2014-11-03 09:03:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I think I might do that
2014-11-03 09:04:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How did you download something from Darcy before? Does she gchat you?
2014-11-03 09:05:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had texted her and sent her a Hangouts message the day your phone died when picking me up from the airport.
2014-11-03 09:11:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah 
2014-11-03 09:11:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've been busy this morning 
2014-11-03 09:13:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I had actually tried looking up some info on the Hangouts data being weird last night, so I already had a game plan when I woke up.
2014-11-03 09:18:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you
2014-11-03 09:27:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-11-03 09:27:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too

2014-11-03 09:27:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was thinking that this morning
2014-11-03 09:28:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]this is a pretty durable cold
2014-11-03 09:45:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we send each other 158 messages per day
2014-11-03 09:45:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on average

2014-11-03 09:46:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like each sends the other 158?

2014-11-03 14:44:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ahh, the search for my car after not driving it for a week
2014-11-03 14:45:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On the plus side, it's like 60 degs
2014-11-03 14:46:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I saw that!
2014-11-03 14:46:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's super nice.

2014-11-03 14:51:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much can that possible be worth?
2014-11-03 14:52:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe it was a real extra tire?
2014-11-03 14:52:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sucks
2014-11-03 14:59:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then!
2014-11-03 14:59:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I saw this while driving to the museum 
2014-11-03 15:00:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was a targeted attack!
2014-11-03 15:00:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha wow

2014-11-03 15:01:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"

  I'm really sorry to hear about this. There seems to be a rash of spare tires being stolen from RAV 4s across the city. I know people who have has their tire stolen in broad daylight in Hyde Park and in the South Loop. So everyone with a RAV should be careful and get a lock on their tire."
2014-11-03 15:01:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from June 2014
2014-11-03 15:01:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know you don't drive a RAV
2014-11-03 15:02:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it seems to be a thing
2014-11-03 15:04:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very similar cars
2014-11-03 15:04:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How weird 
2014-11-03 15:05:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I need to buy another spare 
2014-11-03 15:05:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you?
2014-11-03 15:05:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I have one anywhere else in the car 
2014-11-03 15:06:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just mean do you actually need one.
2014-11-03 15:06:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It needs one before you drive it down

2014-11-03 18:28:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess we've been seeing each other in person more often 
2014-11-03 18:28:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lately 
2014-11-03 18:29:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'm sure that contributes

2014-11-03 18:47:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where in general
2014-11-03 18:48:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]SXSW is in austin during SB
2014-11-03 18:48:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a lot of people do that then?
2014-11-03 18:49:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-11-03 18:49:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some ppl go to Florida 
2014-11-03 18:50:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like PCB?
2014-11-03 18:50:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah. My friends usually went home for a bit too I guess 
2014-11-03 18:50:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-11-03 18:50:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is your sister asking?
2014-11-03 18:50:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no I'm asking
2014-11-03 18:50:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-03 18:51:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you planning a SB trip?
2014-11-03 18:51:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just thinking about stuff I could do next semester
2014-11-03 18:52:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's going to be the best ratio of money to obligations I think I've ever had
2014-11-03 18:54:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you're going on a trip by yourself?
2014-11-03 18:54:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not necessarily
2014-11-03 18:54:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I will if I have to
2014-11-03 18:56:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]SXSW is fun, but not the stereotypical beachy time 
2014-11-03 18:56:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not necessarily even talking about spring break exclusively
2014-11-03 18:56:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might go on several trips if I can swing
2014-11-03 18:56:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it
2014-11-03 18:56:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I should
2014-11-03 18:56:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I could stay with Hannah if I wanted to do SXSW
2014-11-03 18:57:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought she went to Texas state
2014-11-03 18:58:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she does
2014-11-03 18:58:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's like a 40 min drive
2014-11-03 18:58:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or train ride
2014-11-03 18:59:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not very ideal but I guess it's save you money
2014-11-03 18:59:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just kidding
2014-11-03 18:59:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would you be OK with that?
2014-11-03 18:59:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not really 
2014-11-03 18:59:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially since I would want to go with you 
2014-11-03 19:02:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]don't blow all your money lol
2014-11-03 19:05:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought we were going to take some trip together next semester
2014-11-03 19:05:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we are
2014-11-03 19:05:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's gonna be one of my trips, haha
2014-11-03 19:06:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can go on other trips with me if you want
2014-11-03 19:06:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you'll probably be busier than I am
2014-11-03 19:06:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll probably take my tent back.
2014-11-03 19:06:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]word
2014-11-03 19:08:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where do you wanna go?
2014-11-03 19:08:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]somewhere tropical I guess?
2014-11-03 19:08:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno
2014-11-03 19:08:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I tried to plan a little nd you said wait until next ywar lol
2014-11-03 19:09:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]all you mentioned was flights to the Bahamas
2014-11-03 19:09:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nothing about where we'd stay or anything
2014-11-03 19:09:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess that's something we can sort while I'm there.
2014-11-03 19:15:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's up to you
2014-11-03 19:15:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you can make a list of places you want to go and I'll pick the ones I want to go to, too
2014-11-03 19:17:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm OK
2014-11-03 19:39:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are we going to try to do something around our anniversary?
2014-11-03 19:39:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sure!
2014-11-03 19:39:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]something romannnnnttiiiiccccc?    😉

2014-11-03 19:40:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's one way to kill my baby urges
2014-11-03 19:40:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-11-03 19:40:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's actually Darcy and Jims 2 yr anniversary today 
2014-11-03 19:41:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm hanging out on campus until 9 or so to give them some alone time 
2014-11-03 19:41:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's nice of you
2014-11-03 19:42:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I get the feeling they aren't going to really take advantage of it 
2014-11-03 19:42:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why's that?
2014-11-03 19:43:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She said I was welcome to have what they're eating for dinner too lol 
2014-11-03 19:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-03 19:43:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]has she ever said whether or not she hears us
2014-11-03 19:43:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]/
2014-11-03 19:43:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha no
2014-11-03 19:45:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure the people below you can.
2014-11-03 19:45:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably more so than anything Darcy would hear
2014-11-03 19:47:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol that's probably true
2014-11-03 19:48:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or the people walking by the window
2014-11-03 19:48:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe, I bet you can't really hear us outside
2014-11-03 19:49:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the movement of the bed definitely has to be audible to the people below you
2014-11-03 19:49:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd probably drive me crazy honestly
2014-11-03 19:49:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-03 19:57:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe they aren't home that much
2014-11-03 19:57:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well they'd only hear it when they were in that room I guess
2014-11-03 19:57:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which might not be a bedroom
2014-11-03 19:59:18[SEP]Michael A.

  Psilocybin dramatically transformed the participants' brain organization, Expert said. With the drug, normally unconnected brain regions showed brain activity that was synchronized tightly in time. That suggested the drug was stimulating long-range connections the brain normally wouldn't make. After the drug wore off, brain activity went back to normal.    "
2014-11-03 21:06:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't get something to download 
2014-11-03 21:07:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's making me really mad
2014-11-03 21:07:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to get the biopython package
2014-11-03 21:07:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And when I try to install it it gives me this

2014-11-03 21:09:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-11-03 21:09:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could try a Linux virtual machine
2014-11-03 21:09:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know anything about Macs
2014-11-03 21:09:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I can't help you much
2014-11-03 21:09:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would I have to reinstall python?
2014-11-03 21:10:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and all the biopython dependencies
2014-11-03 21:10:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think most distros come with Python
2014-11-03 21:10:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let me see how hard it is for me to install
2014-11-03 21:10:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you have to have NumPy installed
2014-11-03 21:10:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]which you probably do
2014-11-03 21:10:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-11-03 21:11:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you use easy_install?
2014-11-03 21:11:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yes
2014-11-03 21:11:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but that also failed
2014-11-03 21:11:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that doesn't work?
2014-11-03 21:11:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-11-03 21:11:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's something with my SDK tools
2014-11-03 21:12:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just did an easy_install and it works
2014-11-03 21:13:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you try the fink method?
2014-11-03 21:14:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no
2014-11-03 21:14:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would use a virtual machine
2014-11-03 21:14:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]most of this software is probably developed on Linux
2014-11-03 21:14:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I told you this a while back
2014-11-03 21:14:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just easier to make sure all the proper dependencies are installed
2014-11-03 21:15:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]this should work on mac though
2014-11-03 21:15:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lots of people use it
2014-11-03 21:16:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't have the directory /Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.6.sdk?
2014-11-03 21:16:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or that file in that location?
2014-11-03 21:17:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no
2014-11-03 21:18:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm running 10.10 now anyways
2014-11-03 21:18:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is a giant clusterfuck
2014-11-03 21:18:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't help you
2014-11-03 21:18:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok
2014-11-03 21:21:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't even get my linux virtual machine to run
2014-11-03 21:22:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've set one up already?
2014-11-03 21:22:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]kernel driver is not installed
2014-11-03 21:22:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've used it once before
2014-11-03 21:22:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]on VirtualBox
2014-11-03 21:23:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could try setting up another one?
2014-11-03 21:23:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's hard for me to really troubleshoot
2014-11-03 21:23:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just did that
2014-11-03 21:24:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know don't wprry about it
2014-11-03 21:24:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://lists.open-bio.org/pipermail/biopython-dev/2014-April/011240.html
2014-11-03 21:24:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]people say to reinstall VirtualBox
2014-11-03 21:28:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok it's working
2014-11-03 21:28:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on your Mac? Or in the VirtualBox?
2014-11-03 21:28:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need a disk containing the operating system I wish to install on the virtual machine
2014-11-03 21:28:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no, virtualbox is working
2014-11-03 21:28:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-11-03 21:29:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.wikihow.com/Install-Ubuntu-on-VirtualBox
2014-11-03 21:37:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]is linux windows?
2014-11-03 21:38:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-11-03 21:55:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish you were here 
2014-11-03 21:55:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not just so you can help me with my computer lol 
2014-11-03 21:55:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-11-03 21:55:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I was gonna say
2014-11-03 21:55:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish I was there too, though
2014-11-03 21:56:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This was supposed to be a nice and easy setup so I could do that restriction site analysis tm
2014-11-03 21:57:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But noooooo
2014-11-03 21:57:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you need to get this VirtualBox up and running and then just use that for this kind of stuff
2014-11-03 21:57:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or better yet get another laptop and put Linux on it
2014-11-03 21:58:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's going to make these things so much easier to deal with
2014-11-03 21:58:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But now I have to learn Linux commands 
2014-11-03 21:58:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just barely learned Unix 
2014-11-03 21:58:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they use the same commands
2014-11-03 21:58:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought the shell was a little different 
2014-11-03 21:58:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe
2014-11-03 21:59:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]most of this research software provides the commands for doing things
2014-11-03 21:59:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it actually works
2014-11-03 21:59:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because they developed it on Linux
2014-11-03 21:59:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Almost every bioinformatician person I know uses macs 
2014-11-03 21:59:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you just follow the steps
2014-11-03 21:59:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they don't use virtual machines?
2014-11-03 22:00:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know, maybe
2014-11-03 22:00:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's this website, bios tats
2014-11-03 22:00:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*biostats
2014-11-03 22:00:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*biostars
2014-11-03 22:00:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's like stack overflow for biologists 
2014-11-03 22:01:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's pretty Unix heavy I feel like
2014-11-03 22:01:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean when you say Unix?
2014-11-03 22:01:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you give me an example?
2014-11-03 22:02:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like Mac users 
2014-11-03 22:02:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-11-03 22:02:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much development are they doing?
2014-11-03 22:03:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a combo of people using programs and the developers 
2014-11-03 22:03:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the lab UT Southwestern all used Linux
2014-11-03 22:03:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm sure all of the UCSD in Coursera use Linux
2014-11-03 22:04:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those aren't biologists initially though 
2014-11-03 22:04:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I don't really know what a bioinformatician is
2014-11-03 22:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess
2014-11-03 22:04:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you're just using software
2014-11-03 22:04:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then you need to make sure the software works with Macs
2014-11-03 22:04:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you're kinda screwed in that case anyway
2014-11-03 22:05:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]somehow this linux thing is password protected
2014-11-03 22:05:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was a delayed text
2014-11-03 22:05:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-11-03 22:05:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is it password protected?
2014-11-03 22:11:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nvm 
2014-11-03 22:21:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got Ubuntu up
2014-11-03 22:21:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And started to build bio python 
2014-11-03 22:21:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it gave me the same error
2014-11-03 22:21:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wut
2014-11-03 22:21:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you used the easy_install method?
2014-11-03 22:21:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-11-03 22:22:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-11-03 22:22:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it shouldn't be doing that
2014-11-03 22:22:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a Mac error
2014-11-03 22:23:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you trying to install the Mac version?
2014-11-03 22:23:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just have easy_install set up
2014-11-03 22:23:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nooo
2014-11-03 22:23:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not the exact same error 
2014-11-03 22:23:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sudo apt- get install python - setuptools
2014-11-03 22:23:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do that
2014-11-03 22:23:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then sudo easy_install -f  http://biopython.org/DIST/  biopython
2014-11-03 22:23:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sudo easy_install -f  http://biopython.org/DIST/  biopython
2014-11-03 22:24:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can follow the directions on the website 
2014-11-03 22:24:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that didn't work either 
2014-11-03 22:24:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what did it say
2014-11-03 22:24:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Permission denied for the installation directory 
2014-11-03 22:25:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you do sudo?
2014-11-03 22:25:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sudo easy install
2014-11-03 22:25:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sudo easy_install -f  http://biopython.org/DIST/  biopython
2014-11-03 22:25:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]copy and paste that
2014-11-03 22:26:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't copy and paste bc I'm on a virtual machine!
2014-11-03 22:26:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ugh
2014-11-03 22:26:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there is a way to enable that
2014-11-03 22:27:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't remember how
2014-11-03 22:27:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]type that character for character
2014-11-03 22:27:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did I got the same etro
2014-11-03 22:27:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a permission denied error?
2014-11-03 22:27:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that doesn't make any sense
2014-11-03 22:27:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do I need to be in the directory at Python.h?
2014-11-03 22:27:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No the same error as the other install
2014-11-03 22:28:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what was the other error?
2014-11-03 22:28:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory 
2014-11-03 22:28:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]install python
2014-11-03 22:28:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]#include "Python.h"
2014-11-03 22:29:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it is installed 
2014-11-03 22:29:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you might need the development tools
2014-11-03 22:29:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hold on
2014-11-03 22:29:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So is numpy and they both work 
2014-11-03 22:29:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-03 22:29:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sudo apt- get  install python - dev
2014-11-03 22:30:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that seems like a bug on the Biopython people's part
2014-11-03 22:32:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It seemed to install but the tests aren't working
2014-11-03 22:32:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's happening
2014-11-03 22:32:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I said "import biopython"
2014-11-03 22:33:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No module named biopsy him
2014-11-03 22:33:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the test they use is this
2014-11-03 22:33:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from Bio.Seq import Seq
2014-11-03 22:33:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or the tests it has on the website 
2014-11-03 22:34:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I did that
2014-11-03 22:34:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it doesn't work?
2014-11-03 22:34:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-11-03 22:34:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can't find the module 
2014-11-03 23:05:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I missed a shooting
2014-11-03 23:05:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really?
2014-11-03 23:06:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]someone crashed into the CVS apparently
2014-11-03 23:06:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There are cop cars at every corner and 2 ambulances 
2014-11-03 23:06:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://instagram.com/p/u9xb9XnY05/
2014-11-03 23:06:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I missed something 
2014-11-03 23:06:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh shit!
2014-11-03 23:07:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd you find that so fast 
2014-11-03 23:07:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Twitter
2014-11-03 23:07:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the one thing it's good for
2014-11-03 23:08:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol
2014-11-03 23:12:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why you no answer?
2014-11-03 23:12:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you clal?
2014-11-03 23:12:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-11-03 23:12:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it made Chrome crash
2014-11-03 23:12:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can try again now
2014-11-03 23:17:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not going through 
2014-11-03 23:17:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nvm 
2014-11-03 23:17:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I'm gonna smoke and pass out. Technology is not in my favor today
2014-11-03 23:17:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]k
2014-11-03 23:19:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you 
2014-11-03 23:19:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks for hanging in there with me
2014-11-03 23:19:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]love you too
2014-11-04 00:09:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I did the experiment.
2014-11-04 00:09:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah?
2014-11-04 00:09:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-11-04 00:10:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well??
2014-11-04 00:10:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've got some video evidence for you.
2014-11-04 00:11:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should've had a dark backdrop, though.
2014-11-04 00:11:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-11-04 00:11:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you make a scale bar?
2014-11-04 00:12:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no
2014-11-04 00:12:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it's necessary, though.
2014-11-04 00:13:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you have estimated distance? 
2014-11-04 00:13:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B4iRo-F4K4f8OHQ5WlFKenlBR3c/view?usp=sharing
2014-11-04 00:18:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So is that not at the same level it used to be?
2014-11-04 00:18:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't nkow
2014-11-04 00:18:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's hard to see how far it goes at the very beginning 
2014-11-04 00:19:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It is kinda sexy though 
2014-11-04 00:19:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can see where it lands on the shirt
2014-11-04 00:20:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah 
2014-11-04 00:20:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So don't you need to now jack of twice in a row?
2014-11-04 00:20:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to see if it doesn't go as far?
2014-11-04 00:21:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-11-04 00:21:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess that'd be the scientific way to do it
2014-11-04 00:21:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think I have enough dat
2014-11-04 00:21:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a
2014-11-04 00:22:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cum on mah titttttiesss
2014-11-04 00:22:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-04 00:22:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well at least I think I'm capable now
2014-11-04 00:23:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least on the first session
2014-11-04 00:23:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For sure 
2014-11-04 09:36:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I keep feeling like I was hit by a train in the mornings 
2014-11-04 09:36:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My nose hurts, my body hurts 
2014-11-04 09:36:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😞 
2014-11-04 09:37:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I woke up at 6:00 AM with a headache

2014-11-04 10:37:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm
2014-11-04 10:37:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm getting in my car but I'll send it in a bit 
2014-11-04 10:37:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. Yeah, it's not coming up in a search.
2014-11-04 10:38:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nevermind I found it
2014-11-04 10:38:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it didn't have the dates in the subject like the other ones did
2014-11-04 10:51:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Friday to tuesd?
2014-11-04 10:51:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-04 10:52:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:(((((
2014-11-04 10:52:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but we see each other a week after
2014-11-04 10:52:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should've made it wed
2014-11-04 10:52:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I know
2014-11-04 10:53:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but yeah leaving in the morning makes it feel like we don't even really have that day usually
2014-11-04 10:53:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess we get to sleep together at least
2014-11-04 10:54:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's all I want anyways 
2014-11-04 10:54:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha of course
2014-11-04 10:55:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I'm only in it for the snugs, what are you in it for?
2014-11-04 10:56:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the clumsiness
2014-11-04 10:57:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha I doubt that 
2014-11-04 11:01:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think my pubes will be near peak jungle when we see each other
2014-11-04 11:01:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you'll have to let me know what you think
2014-11-04 11:01:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't remember how I kept them when we first got together
2014-11-04 11:03:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why don't you trim them?
2014-11-04 11:03:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With scissors 
2014-11-04 11:04:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I could do that
2014-11-04 11:04:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-04 11:04:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm curious how much you care
2014-11-04 11:06:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably not too much 
2014-11-04 11:06:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But no one likes pubes in their mouth 
2014-11-04 11:06:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my point is that you haven't ever seemed to comment one way or another
2014-11-04 11:08:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you've predispositioned me with the jungle comment lol
2014-11-04 11:09:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]predisposed you to prefer no jungle?
2014-11-04 11:11:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To be wary
2014-11-04 11:11:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-11-04 11:12:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're so ambivalent about my pubes
2014-11-04 11:13:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have your previous girlfriends had strong opinions?
2014-11-04 11:14:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no I guess not
2014-11-04 11:14:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think you're the first girlfriend to ever comment on any aspect of my manscaping
2014-11-04 11:31:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You asked me!
2014-11-04 11:31:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You said something about trimming my chest and stomach hair before. That's what I'm referring to.
2014-11-04 11:32:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You asked if you should trim it again, and I said it could get a little scratchy right after trimming 
2014-11-04 11:35:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]After further forum research, it seems that installing things on Mac does generally suck 
2014-11-04 11:35:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But a lot of people keep it for general use
2014-11-04 11:35:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-11-04 11:35:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's funny how Macs "just work"
2014-11-04 11:35:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except for things that people who do computational stuff
2014-11-04 11:35:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or else their lab has a person in charge of installing stuff on the lab macs 
2014-11-04 11:36:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think some of my mac issues have been because of the file structure 
2014-11-04 11:36:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It hides where is places files 
2014-11-04 11:37:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can see that being annoying
2014-11-04 11:37:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm not sure what you mean
2014-11-04 11:37:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like a program can't find a library because when I installed it it put it somewhere weird 
2014-11-04 11:37:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]honestly, I think everyone in science should use Linux
2014-11-04 11:37:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and develop their programs on Linux
2014-11-04 11:38:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like this multisystem idea 
2014-11-04 11:38:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have a personal computer and a Linux for accessing servers or w/e
2014-11-04 11:38:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just because you're used to Mac, though
2014-11-04 11:38:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly 
2014-11-04 11:38:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fuck close source operating systems, man
2014-11-04 11:38:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to switch
2014-11-04 11:38:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Entirely 
2014-11-04 11:39:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and Apple has so much proprietary bull shit
2014-11-04 11:39:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's the opposite of what academia should be promoting
2014-11-04 11:42:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes yes yes 
2014-11-04 11:43:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well when it's time for me to get a new computer I'll get something else 
2014-11-04 11:43:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Macs aren't nearly as appealing without my cousins discount anyways 
2014-11-04 11:43:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean I'm totally down with people using Macs personally
2014-11-04 11:44:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was more a rant against the department
2014-11-04 11:44:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-11-04 11:44:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and how they're so Apple circle-jerky
2014-11-04 11:44:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They just got a new iMac 
2014-11-04 12:19:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this stupid fucking enrollment system, man
2014-11-04 12:19:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was blocked from signing up for two classes because it said I hadn't fulfilled the prerequisite
2014-11-04 12:19:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I have
2014-11-04 12:20:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna be so pissed if they get filled
2014-11-04 12:20:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]such a shitty fucking system
2014-11-04 12:20:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man it makes me rage
2014-11-04 12:20:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe email the professor?
2014-11-04 12:20:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I emailed the guy that deals with this shit
2014-11-04 12:20:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but this is 100% of the time I've had to deal with this shit
2014-11-04 12:20:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Explain that you have the prerequisites, and need to graduate and really want to take his class
2014-11-04 12:21:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like why even pretend like it's possible to do online
2014-11-04 12:23:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]FUCK!
2014-11-04 12:23:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he's not responding to emails because of some bullshit first come first served shit
2014-11-04 12:23:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]GODDAMMIT
2014-11-04 12:23:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]email the professor
2014-11-04 12:23:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm so fucking pissed
2014-11-04 12:23:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]in case it does get filled
2014-11-04 12:23:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the professors don't have any control
2014-11-04 12:58:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol what a clusterfuck
2014-11-04 12:58:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I get there
2014-11-04 12:59:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they have like four offices open for enrolling
2014-11-04 12:59:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]luckily there wasn't a line
2014-11-04 12:59:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I go in and explain my situation to the lady
2014-11-04 12:59:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and she says something along the lines like you have to fill out a form to enroll in classes
2014-11-04 12:59:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like this is what you're supposed to do every semester
2014-11-04 12:59:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you have to bring in the form
2014-11-04 12:59:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the people register you
2014-11-04 12:59:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even though I've NEVER done that
2014-11-04 13:00:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I was able to register online for classes last time
2014-11-04 13:00:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]anyway
2014-11-04 13:00:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she's using a pretty bitchy tone
2014-11-04 13:00:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm like whatever I'll fill out the form
2014-11-04 13:00:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I go to my computer
2014-11-04 13:00:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and open up the course enrollment page again
2014-11-04 13:00:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to get the information
2014-11-04 13:00:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it shows me as enrolled in all my classes
2014-11-04 13:00:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-11-04 13:00:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I go ahead and fill out the form anyway
2014-11-04 13:00:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]take it in
2014-11-04 13:01:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and she checks and yep I was successfully enrolled in the classes without needing to fill out hte form
2014-11-04 13:01:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was 45 minutes of stress I could've done without
2014-11-04 13:01:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the good news is I'll never deal with that clustefuck again
2014-11-04 13:01:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and all my classes are on MW!
2014-11-04 14:25:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wooooo!
2014-11-04 14:28:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lots of 4 day weekends 
2014-11-04 14:28:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry it was such a stressful and obnoxious morning though
2014-11-04 14:31:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]AND there was a steady rain and a lot of wind resistance during my bike ride.
2014-11-04 14:31:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Come give be loving.
2014-11-04 14:35:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I wish 
2014-11-04 14:35:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Long day of lab work 
2014-11-04 14:37:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Same thing.
2014-11-04 14:38:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm surprised you didn't throw anything across the room
2014-11-04 14:38:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You seemed that mad via text
2014-11-04 14:40:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I was pretty pissed. There was a lot if audible swearing and talking shit about UTD.
2014-11-04 14:43:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When the last told me I needed to fill out the form, I sat down in the hallway initially to fill it out because it would've literally taken me less than five minutes to fill out, and this dickhead also doing enrollments in his office said I had to move so I wouldn't get in anyone's way and other students "don't need to be dealing with my problems", and that almost promoted a nasty response.
2014-11-04 14:43:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*lady
2014-11-04 14:44:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woah
2014-11-04 14:44:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Instead I just said very sarcastically, "Well it would've been nice if I had been made aware of these problems beforehand."
2014-11-04 14:45:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh! I forgot to mention that there wasn't ANYONE in the hallway when he said that.
2014-11-04 17:23:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh I hate tuesdays
2014-11-04 18:02:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that's a long day for you
2014-11-04 18:57:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I never have time to pee!
2014-11-04 18:57:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha noooo

2014-11-05 18:06:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Congrats on the splooging lol
2014-11-05 18:06:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-11-05 18:06:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]thanks
2014-11-05 18:06:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]feels good
2014-11-05 18:08:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm having a mild moment of grad student despair 
2014-11-05 18:08:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh no
2014-11-05 18:08:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's wrong?
2014-11-05 18:08:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't know what the best method is for the sequencing 
2014-11-05 18:09:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]speaking to those different people didn't help?
2014-11-05 18:10:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They gave me advice for how to pool and avoid negative comments about spurious results 
2014-11-05 18:10:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I feel like I left there more confused 
2014-11-05 18:11:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I just tried to do the simplest thing on the computer and it took me an hour 
2014-11-05 18:12:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I also feel pretty fucking dumb
2014-11-05 18:12:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man. That kind of thing is gonna happen when you're starting out.
2014-11-05 18:13:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I guess I don't know what to tell you about the methods, if they think there's a way that you can do it that covers your ass then that sounds OK to me
2014-11-05 18:16:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I can't do all the analyses I want with pooling 
2014-11-05 18:17:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well it sounds like you're going to have to make a sacrifice somewhere
2014-11-05 18:17:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you just need to pick something and go with it
2014-11-05 18:17:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and if there are issues you'll just have to try again
2014-11-05 18:18:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't even have enough money to do this 
2014-11-05 18:18:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What if I never get more finding 
2014-11-05 18:18:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know how that kind of thing works
2014-11-05 21:32:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bL02GyIsKw#t=25
2014-11-05 21:51:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you up to?
2014-11-05 21:54:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Went to the museum until 9 and now watching American Horror Story 
2014-11-05 21:54:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok

2014-11-05 23:19:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]something wrong with you?

2014-11-05 23:23:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just got home a few minutes ago and I felt like reading 
2014-11-05 23:23:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry 
2014-11-05 23:23:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll call you tomorrow 
2014-11-05 23:23:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't worry about it

2014-11-06 12:02:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://johnstantongeddes.org/personal/2014/10/16/leaving-academia.html
2014-11-06 13:17:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd like to know more about how he actually got that job. Did he just apply and get an interview? Why would he could an interview over a bunch of people with more directly applicable skills (like already knowing Hadoop). It'd be nice if "data scientist" could be a fallback position for evolutionary biologists, but I think it's a little ridiculous for them to expect that to be the case.
2014-11-06 13:30:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think he's saying people should expect that to be a viable option for everyone
2014-11-06 13:30:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just thought it was a neat story
2014-11-06 14:17:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It seems very "Aw, shucks. Academia might be too risky for me. Guess I'll just be a data scientist!"
2014-11-06 17:41:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how was your day?
2014-11-06 17:47:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fine yours
2014-11-06 18:10:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry hangouts didn't update
2014-11-06 18:11:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's alright
2014-11-06 18:11:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]learning about chalk
2014-11-06 18:13:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I calculated the cost for all the method options
2014-11-06 18:14:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and wrote out some pros/cons
2014-11-06 18:58:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Any chance you'd want to skip class on 11/14 and take a 4:40p-6:57p flight to chicago instead?
2014-11-06 18:58:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And go to this Grad Gala thing with me
2014-11-06 19:00:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to, but I don't think I should.
2014-11-06 19:00:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you have important stuff for class that day?
2014-11-06 19:00:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Southwest is sold out anyway
2014-11-06 19:01:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]spirit has a flight that's only $30 more than what we paid for SWA
2014-11-06 19:02:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah, I don't think I should do it.
2014-11-06 19:03:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't have to pick me up or anything
2014-11-06 19:03:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If money is the issue, I'd pay for it
2014-11-06 19:03:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not
2014-11-06 19:03:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-11-06 19:04:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does it go late?
2014-11-06 19:04:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]7:30-11:30
2014-11-06 19:04:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-11-06 19:05:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I can just take the bus in
2014-11-06 19:05:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no I'll pick you up
2014-11-06 19:05:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why?
2014-11-06 19:05:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not a big deal
2014-11-06 19:07:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not sure who else I know is going
2014-11-06 19:07:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll ask
2014-11-06 19:07:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmk
2014-11-06 19:08:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You were willing to skip your class the other week for Halloween. I guess I don't understand why now it's an issue
2014-11-06 19:08:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just gonna leave early, and I didn't end up doing it.
2014-11-06 19:09:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you'd only have to leave early for this flight too, it's the same spirit flight
2014-11-06 19:09:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why is it so important I go to this?
2014-11-06 19:10:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just thought it'd be fun. A chance to dress up and dance and stuff. 
2014-11-06 19:10:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not really important
2014-11-06 19:10:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll drop it
2014-11-06 19:10:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then why are you pushing for a $169 flight and me skipping class?
2014-11-06 19:11:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The flight is $113 on Spirt's website
2014-11-06 19:11:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just didn't realize you weren't down with skipping that class afterall, but now I do
2014-11-06 19:22:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was going to change my flight completely
2014-11-06 19:22:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]righ?
2014-11-06 19:22:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was going to come the next weekend
2014-11-06 19:23:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes, and get in around 7p on the next Friday 
2014-11-06 19:24:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it wasn't like I was just trying to get there a couple of hours earlier
2014-11-06 19:25:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know, it's ok. I'm trying to drop it, you can too 
2014-11-06 19:25:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if it's something you really want we can do it
2014-11-06 19:29:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah, I take it back. I'll drop it now.
2014-11-06 19:31:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol k
2014-11-06 19:32:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't been feeling very loving today, maybe we should just punt until tomorrow.
2014-11-06 19:32:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Punt?
2014-11-06 19:32:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#footballmetaphor
2014-11-06 19:33:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-11-06 19:33:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Any particular reason you don't feel "loving"?
2014-11-06 19:34:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I wasn't really crazy about how you handled your long day yesterday with regards to me.
2014-11-06 19:35:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]By being busy from 9a-11p and not able to talk to you?
2014-11-06 19:35:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you chose not to talk to me at the end of the night
2014-11-06 19:35:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that's fine
2014-11-06 19:36:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just don't feel loving
2014-11-06 19:37:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd rather not be punished by being given the cold shoulder because I had a shitty day
2014-11-06 19:38:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not punishing ou
2014-11-06 19:39:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless you consider not talking to me last night punishing me?
2014-11-06 19:40:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You are unhappy about me not talking to you last night, so you decide you don't want to talk to me tonight. I did not decide to not talk to you last night based on any action of yours. 
2014-11-06 19:41:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really understand why it's different.
2014-11-06 19:42:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then nevermind. Have a good night. 
2014-11-06 19:43:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you too
2014-11-06 23:46:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you.
2014-11-06 23:46:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know. I love you too  😘   
2014-11-07 11:23:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good morning, sugar
2014-11-07 11:33:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good morning
2014-11-07 11:33:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how's your day going?
2014-11-07 11:37:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not bad
2014-11-07 11:38:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Went to EvProcesses this morning 
2014-11-07 11:38:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're reading a book about applying information theory and computer science to understanding evolution 
2014-11-07 11:38:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. What is it?
2014-11-07 11:47:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The Engine of Complexity
2014-11-07 11:48:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:Evolution as Computation
2014-11-07 11:48:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]by John Mayfield
2014-11-07 11:48:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-11-07 11:48:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is it so far?
2014-11-07 11:49:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The first chapter was ok, written a little too broadly abd some of the language choice was confusing
2014-11-07 11:49:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I'm intrigued
2014-11-07 11:49:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and it led to good discussion
2014-11-07 11:49:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. Sounds like an interesting concept.
2014-11-07 11:51:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how's your day?
2014-11-07 11:51:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not bad. Had breakfast with my dad and sister.
2014-11-07 11:52:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]got my birthday present from my parents
2014-11-07 11:52:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]nice, what was it?
2014-11-07 11:52:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$100 for my phone
2014-11-07 11:54:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]cooool
2014-11-07 11:55:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeppp what are your plans for the day?
2014-11-07 11:58:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do some lab work in the afternoon, then a movie night at Yoseop's
2014-11-07 11:58:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cool
2014-11-07 12:16:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll probably be busy until late, but I'll try to talk to you after I get home if you want to
2014-11-07 12:17:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't have to worry about it
2014-11-07 12:18:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]worry about what?
2014-11-07 12:18:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]talking to me tonight if you're busy
2014-11-07 12:19:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well now I am worried about it, because clearly it bothers you
2014-11-07 12:19:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not worried about it
2014-11-07 12:20:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't care
2014-11-07 12:21:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm getting a lot of mixed signals on that subject
2014-11-07 12:21:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was annoyed by it, but I've adjusted my expectations
2014-11-07 12:22:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]cool
2014-11-07 12:24:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so if I call you later tonight, you won't blow me off right?
2014-11-07 12:24:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-11-07 12:26:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you're not going to say you don't feel like talking to me
2014-11-07 12:27:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't feel like talking to you yesterday
2014-11-07 12:27:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I feel like not talking to me because you had a long day
2014-11-07 12:27:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even for just a few minutes
2014-11-07 12:27:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is kinda absurd
2014-11-07 12:27:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and if I had the same attitude
2014-11-07 12:27:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'd never talk
2014-11-07 12:27:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess that's just how you roll
2014-11-07 12:28:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is fine
2014-11-07 12:28:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't care if we talk anymore
2014-11-07 12:28:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure you'll be free ocassionally
2014-11-07 12:28:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we're seeing each other enough at this point that it's fine
2014-11-07 12:29:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was stressed and upset and tired on Wednesday night, usually a bad combination for us to talk
2014-11-07 12:29:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get that. It's all good.
2014-11-07 12:30:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]LIke I said, I adjusted my expectations.
2014-11-07 12:30:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had gotten home maybe 10 minutes before you sent your goodnight text, and was going to text you something within the next few minutes. 
2014-11-07 12:32:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But instead you pulled some passive aggressiveness, saying for me to not worry about it. And then punishing me. 
2014-11-07 12:32:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When I've already been having a shitty couple of days
2014-11-07 12:33:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I call you or text you pretty much every night. You NEVER call me just to talk
2014-11-07 12:33:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and the one time I don't do it before you go to sleep I get this shit
2014-11-07 12:34:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This -> "and if I had the same attitude we'd never talk but I guess that's just how you roll"
2014-11-07 12:34:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]is completely ridiculous and unfair
2014-11-07 12:35:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know I love talking to you 95% of the time
2014-11-07 12:36:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]at least
2014-11-07 12:37:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't being passive aggressive
2014-11-07 12:37:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you apparently misinterpreted my don't worry about it
2014-11-07 12:37:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant don't worry about calling me
2014-11-07 12:37:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I can see how that'd be ambiguous
2014-11-07 12:37:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't punishing you
2014-11-07 12:37:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not like I wanted to talk to you
2014-11-07 12:37:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and decided I wasn't going to talk to you in spite of that
2014-11-07 12:38:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to make you feel bad
2014-11-07 12:38:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't want to talk to you
2014-11-07 12:38:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because of something I did
2014-11-07 12:38:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I NEVER call you because I'm always free
2014-11-07 12:38:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we've already discussed that
2014-11-07 12:38:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're the one who has to make time to talk to me
2014-11-07 12:39:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I said "I want to talk to you tomorrow" and your response is "I don't want to talk to you because of something you did"
2014-11-07 12:39:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That is punishing me
2014-11-07 12:39:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And feels petty
2014-11-07 12:41:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And your passive aggressiveness came from texting me "Goodnight" when you actually wanted to talk to me. If you had said, "Are you home yet, lets talk for a few minutes" I would've talked to you
2014-11-07 12:41:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or explained why I hadn't yet
2014-11-07 12:41:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have to bike to class.
2014-11-07 12:46:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish you were more understanding sometimes. You should know that I like talking to you because I tell you often enough. And so it shouldn't be too hard to guess that comments like "I don't care if we talk anymore." are hurtful. 
2014-11-07 12:50:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I wish you would be more understanding when I'm stressed, which doesn't really happen very often, instead of extrapolating my actions in that state to how our communication will always be. It makes me feel even worse about an already bad day. I'd rather you be a person in my life who makes me feel better in those situations. 
2014-11-07 13:36:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd like to be the person who makes you feel better in those situations, but I don't know how I can duo that when you won't talk to me.
2014-11-07 13:44:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes talking to you(or anybody) at midnight after a shitty day is not the best way to make me feel better. 
2014-11-07 13:44:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I think this is just another long distance incompatibility between us.
2014-11-07 13:44:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I honestly don't
2014-11-07 13:44:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm concerned over how you reacted to an action of mine that annoyed you
2014-11-07 13:45:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]instead of trying to understand why I did it, your response is to not talk to me for a day
2014-11-07 13:45:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then tell me you don't care if we talk anymore
2014-11-07 13:45:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If that's how you deal with things I do that you don;t like, we're in for big trouble
2014-11-07 13:51:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe we're just fucked then.
2014-11-07 13:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why do you have to do that? 
2014-11-07 14:03:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're essentially saying you have zero desire to help facilitate better communication about issues between us.
2014-11-07 14:03:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's obviously not true and you know that n
2014-11-07 14:03:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then why did you say we're fucked??
2014-11-07 14:04:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's hardly productive
2014-11-07 14:05:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why did you day we're in big trouble? They're the same thing.
2014-11-07 14:10:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's contingent on how you plan to communicate with me
2014-11-07 14:11:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]by saying "we're fucked" it makes it sound like you won't be trying to improve on that or w/e
2014-11-07 14:12:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you really think I'm not going to make an effort to communicate with you?
2014-11-07 14:15:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, but that also doesn't mean you should make comments like that
2014-11-07 14:16:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My comments were trying to be productive. I told you what made me upset about the past couple of days. And I'm serious when I say it makes me a little concerned.
2014-11-07 14:16:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Saying "we're fucked" is not the same thing as what I said
2014-11-07 14:18:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK I'm sorry. I didn't handle this well.
2014-11-07 14:29:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish you didn't doubt our relationship, but I can see why you would.
2014-11-07 14:30:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure things will be better when it's not long distance. But I don't like pushing issues under the rug just because they might only be issues for the next 6 months
2014-11-07 14:35:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hopefully I can be better about it then.
2014-11-07 14:38:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'll try to give you more of a heads up when I'm going to be a little more distant
2014-11-07 14:41:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Please don't take it personally if I don't feel like talking to you on the phone when I'm stressed or upset though. Obviously if you were here I would want you to be there for me, but I'm trying to avoid what happened the other night when I was upset about the halloween visit. 
2014-11-07 14:47:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you so much
2014-11-07 14:47:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm really trying to make this work without losing my mind lol
2014-11-07 14:51:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I appreciate the effort. Hopefully I can start making it easier for you.
2014-11-07 14:59:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😘 
2014-11-07 16:26:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did your sorority have a video like this -->  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23wXC1TvpBA#t=44
2014-11-07 16:26:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Umm not really
2014-11-07 16:26:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't participate in rush ever
2014-11-07 16:26:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]because I had to work that week
2014-11-07 16:27:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like your summer job before college?
2014-11-07 16:27:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or were you already working when you got to school?
2014-11-07 16:27:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that video makes me want to join a sorority
2014-11-07 16:29:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I rushed to get into a sorority, but after that year I had to train new hires for my security job 
2014-11-07 16:29:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that happened during the day at the same time as rush 
2014-11-07 16:30:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-11-07 16:30:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I actually ended up missing a lot of shit because of that job
2014-11-07 16:30:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that sucks
2014-11-07 16:30:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]see, kids shouldn't work at school
2014-11-07 16:32:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I pulled in about 2 k in 2 weeks twice a year for training 
2014-11-07 16:32:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And lots of free food 
2014-11-07 16:33:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it was worth it for you
2014-11-07 16:33:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wouldn't have been for me
2014-11-07 16:33:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much did you make in a year?
2014-11-07 16:36:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno if it was always worth it, I definitely hated it by the end. I made about 20k though
2014-11-07 16:36:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then 5k the summer I did REi
2014-11-07 16:36:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what'd you spend it all on?
2014-11-07 17:21:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My rent, food, fun stuff, a computer 
2014-11-07 17:23:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that came to $20k a year?
2014-11-07 17:23:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mom gave me like $500 a month to help 
2014-11-07 17:24:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you were spending $26k a year?
2014-11-07 17:24:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that seems like a lot to me.
2014-11-07 17:24:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I spent a lot at semester at sea
2014-11-07 17:33:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah that shit's expensive
2014-11-07 17:33:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]$24k in feees
2014-11-07 17:33:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's a semester of tuition at a lot of places, though
2014-11-07 17:34:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The fees were covered mostly by my parents, but traveling at stuff in Europe is expensive 
2014-11-07 17:36:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm just trying to imagine how I could spend $14k more a year
2014-11-07 17:36:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I guess it'd be more like $10k
2014-11-07 17:36:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I basically broke even last school year
2014-11-07 17:36:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on $12k
2014-11-07 17:36:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]over two semesters
2014-11-07 17:37:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's only an extra $200 a week
2014-11-07 17:37:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I could spend that on drugs and shit
2014-11-07 18:07:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean 
2014-11-07 18:07:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cost of living in Miami was more 
2014-11-07 18:08:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I paid $700 a month for rent 
2014-11-07 18:09:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what were your utilities?
2014-11-07 18:09:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]$25 a person 
2014-11-07 18:09:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so like $725?
2014-11-07 18:09:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A/C ain't cheap
2014-11-07 18:09:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-11-07 18:09:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's about $50 more per month than my rent
2014-11-07 18:09:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with utilities
2014-11-07 18:09:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]last year
2014-11-07 18:11:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I spent 10k on drugs and shit 
2014-11-07 18:12:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-11-07 18:12:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll be doing that soon enough
2014-11-07 19:29:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I made a total of $20k including what my mom gave me
2014-11-07 19:29:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That makes more sense
2014-11-08 01:36:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey
2014-11-08 01:38:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You still awake?

2014-11-08 09:04:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought i was hungover, but I think I'm just still sleepy 
2014-11-08 09:05:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And juice is awesome 
2014-11-08 10:11:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ended up going to this cocktail bar up north instead of movie night 
2014-11-08 10:20:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was it
2014-11-08 10:20:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fun 
2014-11-08 10:20:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kind of a weird night in someways 
2014-11-08 10:21:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why's that
2014-11-08 10:21:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Brett and I were talking about him and Haley, and he said he's still slightly annoyed that I got with one of his friends, and I told him we're going to get married 
2014-11-08 10:22:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which kind of made him feel better?
2014-11-08 10:24:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's good I guess
2014-11-08 10:24:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I guess you're just telling people in the department now?
2014-11-08 10:25:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It just popped out 
2014-11-08 10:26:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-11-08 10:26:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not planning on telling anyone else 
2014-11-08 10:27:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]feels like you're telling a lot of people
2014-11-08 10:27:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I thought your whole thing was we were supposed to be doing these things together
2014-11-08 10:27:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but whatever
2014-11-08 10:27:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do what ya want
2014-11-08 10:27:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sorrrrrrryyy
2014-11-08 10:28:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've only told 3 people
2014-11-08 10:28:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not worried about it
2014-11-08 10:29:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No you're right 
2014-11-08 10:29:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should be doing it together 
2014-11-08 10:29:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's not really other ppls business anyways 
2014-11-08 10:30:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's your prerogative
2014-11-08 10:30:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do what you want
2014-11-08 10:31:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I'm stealing your thunder 
2014-11-08 10:31:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm going to try harder to keep a lid on it 
2014-11-08 10:31:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good
2014-11-08 10:31:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can tell people
2014-11-08 10:31:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we don't really need a proposal
2014-11-08 10:31:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see your point about us already knowing
2014-11-08 10:32:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude 
2014-11-08 10:32:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're doing it again 
2014-11-08 10:32:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-11-08 10:32:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tell me if you're unhappy about it
2014-11-08 10:33:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not
2014-11-08 10:33:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't just take away the proposal 
2014-11-08 10:33:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this let's start planning more whenever too
2014-11-08 10:33:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*let's us
2014-11-08 10:34:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know you wanted to do a proposal, and you know I want one 
2014-11-08 10:35:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it loses its appeal when you're telling people
2014-11-08 10:35:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm assuming the people in the department you've told will tell other people
2014-11-08 10:35:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm sure you'll tell more people before any actual proposal would happen
2014-11-08 10:36:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I told you I'm going to try harder to keep a lid on it!
2014-11-08 10:37:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you shouldn't have to, though
2014-11-08 10:37:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you want to tell people you should go for it
2014-11-08 10:37:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Besides, I said it like it in an abstract way. Like we love each other enough that one day we'll get married 
2014-11-08 10:38:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-11-08 10:51:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So will you still propose to me one day? 
2014-11-08 10:51:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We only get to get married once, and I want the whole shebang with you 
2014-11-08 10:52:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want the getting down on one knee and uncontrollable ugly crying 
2014-11-08 10:52:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And cute engagement pictures

2014-11-09 01:24:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I also don't have my computer so its have to be phone 
2014-11-09 01:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh nah
2014-11-09 01:25:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all good
2014-11-09 01:26:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, well goodnight 
2014-11-09 01:26:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll talk to you tomorrow!
2014-11-09 01:26:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]night
2014-11-09 01:27:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No "I love you"? 
2014-11-09 01:28:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess noty
2014-11-09 10:36:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey
2014-11-09 10:36:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]howdy
2014-11-09 10:37:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's up
2014-11-09 10:37:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not much. Torturing myself by reading some stuff on last night's game.
2014-11-09 10:38:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's up with you?
2014-11-09 10:38:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very masichistic 
2014-11-09 10:38:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Clearly I have no idea how to spell that   
2014-11-09 10:39:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-11-09 10:39:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you were close
2014-11-09 10:39:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think
2014-11-09 10:39:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-09 10:39:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought it was just a typo
2014-11-09 10:39:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because i and o are close together
2014-11-09 10:39:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Masochistic  
2014-11-09 10:39:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ah ha
2014-11-09 10:40:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm figuring out what to get at the grocery store.
2014-11-09 10:40:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-11-09 10:40:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you getting?
2014-11-09 10:40:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Food 
2014-11-09 10:40:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol
2014-11-09 10:40:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oooooh
2014-11-09 10:41:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm making this pear/hazelnut torte for dinner 
2014-11-09 10:41:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I need almond milk and other basics 
2014-11-09 10:41:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-11-09 10:41:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I've ever had torte
2014-11-09 10:42:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They can be pretty great 
2014-11-09 10:43:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's usually layers of a thin cake with some kind of cream in between 
2014-11-09 10:43:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm doing dulce de leche 
2014-11-09 10:43:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause that's my jam 
2014-11-09 10:43:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-09 10:43:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds pretty tasty
2014-11-09 11:29:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Side note, mom almost cried when she found out Katherine wanted to bring her own stocking since she likes to buy everyone one to keep with her, so maybe casually say she's not bringing hers hahah. Moms craycray"
2014-11-09 11:29:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from my sister
2014-11-09 12:56:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are we ok? Because I don't feel like we are
2014-11-09 12:58:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I haven't felt particularly awesome
2014-11-09 12:59:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think last night made it pretty clear I'm not really happy without friends.
2014-11-09 12:59:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I guess I've been relying on you for friendship
2014-11-09 12:59:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is not a good strategy
2014-11-09 13:00:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I just lack alternatives
2014-11-09 13:01:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you texted that couple from the auburn alumni bar? 
2014-11-09 13:01:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah
2014-11-09 13:02:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I wasn't asking about how you are, I was asking about our relationship.
2014-11-09 13:02:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We videoed for like 2 hours on Tuesday and were fine.
2014-11-09 13:02:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And now I don't feel like we're in a great place 
2014-11-09 13:04:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's what I'm saying about the friendship thing
2014-11-09 13:04:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like this week has made that clear
2014-11-09 13:04:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that I shouldn't be banking on you to fill my friendship quota or whatever
2014-11-09 13:04:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I guess that might've resulted in a change in my behavior
2014-11-09 13:06:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So our relationship is suffering because you're frustrated about your friend situation?
2014-11-09 13:06:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not because I'm frustrated
2014-11-09 13:07:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just an acknowledgement
2014-11-09 13:07:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's one thing to try and not get upset when I don't talk to you extensively everyday, it's another to actively not want to talk to me as much 
2014-11-09 13:07:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or act as if you don't love me as much 
2014-11-09 13:08:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]am I acting like I don't love you as much?
2014-11-09 13:08:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes 
2014-11-09 13:08:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't felt any love from your direction since Wednesday 
2014-11-09 13:10:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Instead you said you don't care about talking to me and you don't want to propose to me anymore. 
2014-11-09 13:11:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the proposal thing was in response to you telling yet another person
2014-11-09 13:11:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that person being the person you were sleeping with before you met me
2014-11-09 13:11:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or one of the people
2014-11-09 13:12:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it sort of made me realize that what you said about the proposal makes sense
2014-11-09 13:13:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and there's a pretty obvious asymmetry in the relationship when we're long distance that I'm still not sure how to deal with
2014-11-09 13:13:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I sort of started just checking out this weke
2014-11-09 13:13:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And did that make the asymmetry better to deal with?
2014-11-09 13:14:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's less valleys
2014-11-09 13:14:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fewer?
2014-11-09 13:14:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fewer
2014-11-09 13:14:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but there aren't any peaks either obviously
2014-11-09 13:15:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well if that's what will make you happier
2014-11-09 13:15:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll work on not caring about it 
2014-11-09 13:15:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you not caring about exactly?
2014-11-09 13:16:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The fact that you are checking out of our relationship while we're apart 
2014-11-09 13:16:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And to not expect to feel particularly loved 
2014-11-09 13:17:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-11-09 13:19:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As for the proposal, let's scrap it. I don't want you to do it if it feels pointless. But I'll still try to not tell people until you're actually here and it seems more within the realm of possibilities. 
2014-11-09 13:20:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]realm of possibilities?
2014-11-09 13:20:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you have a job and stuff. It sounds ridiculous to tell ppl we're getting married now anyways. 
2014-11-09 13:24:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If this is indeed the way we're going to spend 80% of the time for the next 6 months, I'm also going to try to support your desire for us to be polyamorous. I get your point that it would be easier to accept that philosophy now than later in our relationship. And if we're not going to be very lovey most of the time, then maybe we'd benefit from finding love elsewhere while we're apart.
2014-11-09 13:25:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah?
2014-11-09 13:26:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think it'd still hurt to think about you loving someone else, but I guess I want you to be happy even when I'm not there to make you happy. 
2014-11-09 13:27:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]being polyamorous isn't gonna help my friend situation
2014-11-09 13:27:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-11-09 13:27:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess if you feel like you need to get love from other people that's cool
2014-11-09 13:29:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you could try harder to find fun stuff to do on the weekends, but you probably know better than me. And now when you do go out you won't feel hindered from approaching other women. 
2014-11-09 13:29:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I could try harder too.
2014-11-09 13:29:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I tried reasonably hard last weekend I think.
2014-11-09 13:29:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know why you're bringing the polyamory thing into this.
2014-11-09 13:30:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was perfectly happy last night hanging out with a friend knowing I had a dream girl 750 miles away.
2014-11-09 13:30:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't have any interest in approaching other women.
2014-11-09 13:30:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was enjoying the company of a friend.
2014-11-09 13:31:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's great. 
2014-11-09 13:32:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish you could find a happy medium where you can still make me feel like your dream girl and not get bummed out by your friend situation
2014-11-09 13:32:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I need to make more of an effort, like you said.
2014-11-09 13:33:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I told Carl last night that we should hang out more.
2014-11-09 13:33:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Part of the problem is that we live a solid 20 minutes apart.
2014-11-09 13:33:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I can't really invite him over to hang out.
2014-11-09 13:33:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the other problem is that my friend options are limited.
2014-11-09 13:34:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the friends I have made
2014-11-09 13:34:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we only hung out last year when I made the plans
2014-11-09 13:34:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and this semester is the same story
2014-11-09 13:35:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I acknowledged last weekend that I need to make more of an effort
2014-11-09 13:35:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I only really have two more weekends here unfortunately
2014-11-09 13:35:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the one is right at the end of the semester
2014-11-09 13:36:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I shouldn't say unfortuntaely
2014-11-09 13:36:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I'll be with you at those times
2014-11-09 13:36:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Too late 
2014-11-09 13:36:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't mean "unfortunately I won't be here"
2014-11-09 13:36:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant "unfortunately I won't be able to really try to get better at going out in Dallas"
2014-11-09 13:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this semester
2014-11-09 13:37:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]obviously I'm super excited about spending so much time with you the next couple of months
2014-11-09 13:37:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]don't even pretend like you don't realize that's the case
2014-11-09 13:42:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]All I'm trying to say is, I did not feel a lot of love from you the past few days, which is important to me and makes the distance easier. I don't really understand how talking to me less (unless you're doing it BC you're busy)and "checking out" of our relationship will help you with your other issues. That makes me less excited to see you, honestly. However, I know you've had a shit time and so I'm willing to help facilitate whatever will make you happier, even if that means me being less happy.
2014-11-09 13:43:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you're less excited to see me?
2014-11-09 13:44:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]More so than I have for any other visit. But I'm still looking forward to it. 
2014-11-09 13:45:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think being polyamorous would make you happier?
2014-11-09 13:47:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you're going to act like the past 5 days whenever we're apart, maybe 
2014-11-09 13:48:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you're gonna go on dates and stuff?
2014-11-09 13:54:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it's up to you. If you'll be happier by distancing yourself while we're apart and making me feel not as loved, even if I'm seeing other people then we can do that. Or else you can figure out a way to stay connected with me without getting bummed out about things outside of my control.
2014-11-09 13:54:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I personally vote for the latter 
2014-11-09 14:01:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll try to not be distant, but you can see other people if you want too
2014-11-09 14:01:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you feel like that's something that would make you happier
2014-11-09 14:02:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it felt a little like a threat
2014-11-09 14:02:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the way it was framed
2014-11-09 14:02:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I like this idea better
2014-11-09 14:04:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want you to keep making me happy 
2014-11-09 14:06:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Honestly I could suck it up for a few weeks until winter break. 
2014-11-09 14:06:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-11-09 14:07:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You checking out 
2014-11-09 14:07:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah
2014-11-09 14:07:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a pretty shitty thing to do
2014-11-09 14:07:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're pretty right about that
2014-11-09 14:08:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll be busy 
2014-11-09 14:08:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely way too busy to go on dates with strangers lol
2014-11-09 14:10:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'll avoid checking out, you can be busy, and you can go on dates if you want
2014-11-09 14:11:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not going to go on dates 
2014-11-09 14:16:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you!
2014-11-09 14:16:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks 
2014-11-09 14:16:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you too 
2014-11-09 14:16:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-11-09 14:17:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That was a sincere thanks 
2014-11-09 14:24:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to propose to you still..
2014-11-09 14:24:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then stop telling me you don't 
2014-11-09 14:25:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-11-09 14:32:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get 50% off of a Papa John's order because TCU won last night
2014-11-09 14:32:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty excited about that
2014-11-09 14:38:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you gonna be grumpy with me?
2014-11-09 14:40:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-11-09 14:40:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm driving right now 
2014-11-09 14:40:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-11-09 14:41:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know I don't have the ability to hold a grudge long 
2014-11-09 14:43:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's true.
2014-11-09 14:48:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I might be over this cold by the time I visit
2014-11-09 14:49:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which means healthy kisses and loving!
2014-11-09 14:49:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just in time to pick up a new one here lol
2014-11-09 14:49:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you sick again?!
2014-11-09 14:49:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-11-09 14:49:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel ok
2014-11-09 14:50:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But there are still colds around Chicago
2014-11-09 14:50:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hopefully my immune system is better prepared
2014-11-09 14:55:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-11-09 14:56:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]FSU is only a 2.5 point favorite in Vegas
2014-11-09 15:17:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Woo
2014-11-09 15:17:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Could be a good game 
2014-11-09 15:17:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or more likely they still destroy us
2014-11-09 15:18:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hey! Have a little faith.
2014-11-09 15:18:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty excited about it for you.
2014-11-09 15:18:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's a big game.
2014-11-09 15:18:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I ordered this pizza and I don't know how to go get it.
2014-11-09 15:20:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why didn't you do delivery, silly?
2014-11-09 15:21:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I thought I would be able to carry it in a bag
2014-11-09 15:21:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't think I have a bag big enough
2014-11-09 15:21:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]guses I'll just walk
2014-11-09 15:21:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha

2014-11-09 15:35:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Oh good! I'd feel the same way about yours. 😃"

2014-11-09 15:58:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Apparently Daniel already saw it, so no reason to wait until thanksgiving 
2014-11-09 15:58:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm glad I dodged that bullet lol
2014-11-09 15:58:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tell your sister thanks
2014-11-09 15:59:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK.
2014-11-09 15:59:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Should we go on a date to Navy Pier?
2014-11-09 15:59:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or should we get a group?
2014-11-09 15:59:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Does navy pier have an iMac?
2014-11-09 15:59:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-11-09 15:59:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A big group of Darwinians went together friday 
2014-11-09 16:00:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh OK.
2014-11-09 16:00:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]...I wasn't invited.  😭😭😭
2014-11-09 16:00:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's weird. Why not?
2014-11-09 16:01:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Victoria's boyfriend Michael organized it, and I guess he didn't think I was into scifi-y stuff
2014-11-09 16:01:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And no one thought to forward it to me
2014-11-09 16:01:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not really a big deal, I want to see it with you anyways 
2014-11-09 16:02:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We still haven't been on a movie date 
2014-11-09 16:02:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I realized that not too long ago (or you pointed it out to me)
2014-11-09 16:03:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think an IMAX movie would be a good first.
2014-11-09 16:03:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go big or go home

2014-11-10 08:36:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was probably more of a "I don't want to get out of bed"-over
2014-11-10 08:37:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I have one of those too.
2014-11-10 08:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Come lay on top of me.
2014-11-10 08:37:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Naked.
2014-11-10 08:37:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's exactly what I was thinking of this morning

2014-11-10 08:38:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)

2014-11-10 11:19:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't believe it's that large of a percentage
2014-11-10 11:19:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know anyone like that
2014-11-10 11:19:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least I'm not aware of knowing anyone like that
2014-11-10 12:19:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1) I love the way you hold my hands during sex 2) I love how you do things like buy a picnic basket with a date with me completely in mind
2014-11-10 12:35:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Welllll, I was also thinking how it'd be fun to go on a picnic dat with Haley

2014-11-10 12:49:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and freeze my face off
2014-11-10 12:49:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Get a face mask on Amazon prime 
2014-11-10 12:50:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]doubt it's worth it for the < 10 days I'll need it
2014-11-10 12:50:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What about the 30 days in Chicago 
2014-11-10 12:51:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'm not gonna be biking there
2014-11-10 12:53:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll still be walking

2014-11-10 12:55:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]our happiest message
2014-11-10 12:55:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"I don't think I can match your intoxicated gushing, but I'll go ahead and say that I love you a lot. I really do cherish every second we have together. I know that sounds tacky, but I absolutely mean it. I know I've said it before, but I love being in love with you. I love the way you touch me. I love the way you smile at me. I love how you think I'm this super sexy and amazing dude. I love that you like being sexy for me. I love that you challenge me. I love that you want to make sure things are okay, even though they almost always are! I love the way you cuddle with me after we've had sex. I love how you push your butt into my crotch when you're going to sleep (I'm actually smiling just thinking about it). I love your hand gestures when you're really trying to make a point. I love that you're passionate. I love that you value friendship. I love that you are bold. I love how you talk about our future. I love how you're a romantic. I love how you're an empowered female, but also embrace traditionally feminine characteristics. I love that you're probably contesting that previous statement. I love your style. I love that you feel deeply. I love that you're smart. I love that you think I'm smart. I love your smile... I love your smile... I love your smile. I love kissing you. I love making you cum. I love that you love making me cum! I love your goofiness. I love hearing about your day. I love how you support me. I love that you miss me. I love that you want to be with me. I love you."
2014-11-10 12:55:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]according to NLP
2014-11-10 12:56:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]least happy message
2014-11-10 12:56:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Ugh I slept terrible. At one point I woke up and I swear. I saw a mass of writhing dead hands hovering over the foot of my bed. Even when I blinked they stayed there. When I turned on my lamp it was just a towel over the fan'"
2014-11-10 12:56:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-11-10 12:57:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]second least happy
2014-11-10 12:58:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"I don't know why I get so upset sometimes from conversations like we just had. Earlier I felt almost similar to that time I cried. I've been trying to figure out what causes this reaction, cause it feels illogical and almost an uncontrollable reaction"
2014-11-10 12:58:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it seems to have done a reasonable job
2014-11-10 12:59:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not actually most happy vs. least happy I guess
2014-11-10 12:59:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's highest probability of being happy vs. lowest probability of being happy
2014-11-10 13:07:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And how does it do that? 
2014-11-10 13:07:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just based on some dictionary of happy and sad words?
2014-11-10 13:07:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a Naive Bayes classifier
2014-11-10 13:07:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-10 13:07:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]learned from tweets
2014-11-10 13:08:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Makes sense that the message where you use love 30 times was happy :)
2014-11-10 13:08:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can't turn this in for a project though!
2014-11-10 13:09:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why not?
2014-11-10 13:09:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I won't share the messages
2014-11-10 13:09:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless they want to see them
2014-11-10 13:09:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I'll just give a sample
2014-11-10 13:09:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a curated sample
2014-11-10 13:09:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol
2014-11-10 13:09:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You won't be able to show the best though!
2014-11-10 13:10:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I can probably pick some decent ones
2014-11-10 13:10:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this project is gonna be pretty cool I think
2014-11-10 13:10:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a good start I'd say

2014-11-10 13:29:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but "hahaha" is a stronger predictor for me
2014-11-10 13:29:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]emoticons
2014-11-10 13:29:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are stronger for me
2014-11-10 13:39:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the classifier has a 0.68722 accuracy
2014-11-10 15:07:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Does the second plot seem inspired by the first plot to you?
2014-11-10 15:07:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The line labels in the top plot are product codes for the line labels in the bottom plot
2014-11-10 16:34:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry dear, I was on the architecture boat tour with the fam 
2014-11-10 16:35:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't have to apologize!
2014-11-10 16:35:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it makes me feel bad when you do
2014-11-10 16:37:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The most Michael message: 'Cool. I think the only Muse album I\'ve listened to is Black Holes and Revelations and that was a while back. Like when it came out. I recently listened to Kid A for the first time. Liked it, but wasn\'t blown away. "Everything in Its Right Place" has been one of my favorite songs for a long time, though. I listened to In Rainbows when it came out. Like Kid A, I remember not being blown away by it, but liking several songs. I haven\'t listened to any Bon Iver. I YouTubed their name when they were getting a bunch of hype for that 2011 record and I remember being kind of bored with it, but I\'ll give them a real listen. I think the Black Angels opened for The Black Keys when I saw them in Atlanta in 2006, but I\'ve never really listened to them. I realllly like "Measurements" off of James Blake\'s self-titled album and I like "Limit To Your Love", but those were the only two tracks that stood out to me. I\'ll put all of the ones I haven\'t listened to recently in my rotation, though.'
2014-11-10 16:37:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The most Katherine message "Well, now might be a good time to fess up another thing that I probably should've mentioned by now, but hadn't mostly for selfish reasons (like I thought it would keep you from wanting to see me again in Dallas if I told you before). But Brett and I actually very drunkenly kinda hooked up Monday night in Austin. Which I regretted immediately the next day, especially since he pretty forcibly initiated it in front of Adam Hardy (which was embarrassing) and then he completely ignored me and avoided me on Tuesday. And then heard he had been trying to get with Haley the whole trip/winter break but she wasn't reciprocating. We never talked about it after until walking back from Jimmy's that night you were in town. And that's when I thought we could be actual friends and he joked about me hooking up with you while you were in Chicago.
2014-11-10 16:38:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]second highest Katherine message: I led discussion today, and asked a very specific question based on a review paper about scattered trees- like "outline a project you would do to provide genetic evidence for this ecological claim, including the programs you would use". And it was straight crickets. Then someone answered with a vague comment about bats, so I asked the question again and one of the teachers started to respond and I said, "well let\'s get a student response 1st, I\'ll even buy whoever answers a drink." And  this woman said really snappy "why don\'t you tell us what you would do"
2014-11-10 16:39:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That one wasn't very happy lol
2014-11-10 16:39:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm on number 6 right now and they're all kinda negative for you
2014-11-10 16:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#7 But the guy I was kind of dating over the summer (who has been a good friend of mine for 6 yrs before that) came to visit me over Valentines weekend (which was also just an obnoxious coincidence). But we had an 'agreement' of sorts that if one of us was seeing someone at that time he would sleep on the couch. But since Neither of us were he slept with me.
2014-11-10 18:20:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]3) I love the way you smile with your eyes closed when I kiss your back.
2014-11-10 20:45:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]2014-09-26 09:13:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha the same thing? This is my life. 2014-09-26 09:14:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I thought you were planning to go to a show or something  2014-09-26 09:15:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope 2014-09-26 09:16:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you just go to some bars last night? 2014-09-26 09:16:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, and this one that was a little bit more underground club-esque 2014-09-26 09:17:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where we made "friends" with dudes at a vip table  2014-09-26 09:17:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And they gave us free drinks  2014-09-26 09:18:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then every time we went to the bathroom the bouncer escorted us and that was a little too weird  2014-09-26 09:22:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. 2014-09-26 09:23:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why did the bouncer escort you? 2014-09-26 09:23:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cuz you were at the VIP table? 2014-09-26 09:24:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess 2014-09-26 09:24:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like the dude with the table asked him too 2014-09-26 09:25:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word 2014-09-26 09:25:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's pretty convenient 2014-09-26 09:25:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what did the guys do/ 2014-09-26 09:25:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]? 2014-09-26 09:29:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is it really a feminist thing to do to exploit the guys buying free drinks social trope? 2014-09-26 09:31:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess trope isn't the right word 2014-09-26 09:31:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you know what I'm saying 2014-09-26 09:36:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No, it's not. 2014-09-26 09:37:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did y'all dance? 2014-09-26 09:37:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did they have any coke? 2014-09-26 09:48:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They invited us to their table  2014-09-26 09:49:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]k 2014-09-26 09:51:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No what's not?

2014-11-11 08:35:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is a really great article 
2014-11-11 08:35:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lots of data!
2014-11-11 08:45:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-11-11 08:46:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if if there is a way I could capture the "turn towards/away" beahvior in our data
2014-11-11 08:46:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably too much work right now
2014-11-11 08:46:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I'm definitely a disaster in the long-term phases
2014-11-11 08:46:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-11 08:47:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-11-11 08:47:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought that, in person at least, we're really good at these 
2014-11-11 08:47:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I agree
2014-11-11 08:47:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're complete masters in person
2014-11-11 08:47:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And even long distance occasionally 
2014-11-11 08:47:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'd say you're a master even in the long-distance phases
2014-11-11 08:48:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I definitely fall on the disaster spectrum
2014-11-11 08:48:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You get excited for me when things go well 
2014-11-11 08:48:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]...unless it's all a lie?!?!
2014-11-11 08:49:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no definitely not
2014-11-11 08:49:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm clearly not nice a lot of the time
2014-11-11 08:49:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You rarely ignore me
2014-11-11 08:49:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So that's nice 
2014-11-11 08:50:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol  😘   
2014-11-11 08:50:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're such a better partner than I am!
2014-11-11 08:50:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry    😞 
2014-11-11 08:50:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I'm nottttttt
2014-11-11 08:51:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You have this unwavering confidence in us 
2014-11-11 08:51:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That definitely helps keep us together when we're apart 
2014-11-11 08:52:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you make it easy to be confident
2014-11-11 08:53:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you make me crazy happy
2014-11-11 08:53:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you're super interesting and fun and loving
2014-11-11 08:55:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're boosting your happy score!
2014-11-11 08:55:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-11-11 08:55:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha caught in the act
2014-11-11 08:56:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You are all of those things and more my dear 
2014-11-11 08:56:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And definitely make me crazy happy 
2014-11-11 08:56:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With the occasional just crazy 
2014-11-11 08:56:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-11-11 08:57:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that's how I've always been, so I wouldn't be too worried about it 
2014-11-11 08:57:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm definitely more likely to misread intent 
2014-11-11 08:57:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]As something negative 
2014-11-11 08:57:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which o can work on 
2014-11-11 08:57:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I can see that
2014-11-11 08:58:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'd still say most shit is 97% my fault
2014-11-11 08:58:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm gonna get better
2014-11-11 08:58:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're gonna train me
2014-11-11 08:58:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-11 08:58:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]68/32
2014-11-11 08:58:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha fair enough
2014-11-11 08:59:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to see youuuu
2014-11-11 08:59:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too    😞 
2014-11-11 08:59:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you so much
2014-11-11 08:59:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Turning to each other doesn't work as well for us, because I feel like when we're together we're constantly emotionally/physically angled towards each other 
2014-11-11 09:00:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Already without needing to turn 
2014-11-11 09:00:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a good point
2014-11-11 09:00:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're pretty constantly engaged when we're physically together
2014-11-11 09:01:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even when we're both working
2014-11-11 09:01:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel connected to you
2014-11-11 09:01:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'd be interesting to have our physiological signs taken when we're interacting apart vs together 
2014-11-11 09:01:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely
2014-11-11 09:01:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd love to do that
2014-11-11 09:01:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even when we're being nice to each other while apart 
2014-11-11 09:02:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I have no doubt that there's a different physiological response going on
2014-11-11 09:02:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that would be an interesting study!
2014-11-11 09:02:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]make that a chapter    😉 
2014-11-11 09:03:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oysters and LD.-as in long distance 
2014-11-11 09:03:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not linkage disequilibrium 
2014-11-11 09:03:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah!
2014-11-11 09:04:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why wouldn't they go together?
2014-11-11 09:06:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think I'm as a much of an asshole as some of the people in these relationships, though
2014-11-11 09:06:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Let’s say that one partner had recently received the excellent news that she got into medical school. She would say something like “I got into my top choice med school!” If her partner responded in a  passive destructive  manner, he would ignore the event. For example, he might say something like: “You wouldn’t believe the great news I got yesterday! I won a free t-shirt!”"
2014-11-11 09:07:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like do people actually do that?
2014-11-11 09:07:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Geesh.
2014-11-11 09:14:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't like you calling yourself an asshole 
2014-11-11 09:14:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're not an asshole 
2014-11-11 09:15:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The intent behind the occasional jerk-ish things you do is not contempt or hate for me
2014-11-11 09:16:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's true and I'll quit saying it
2014-11-11 09:17:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this last fight just had me feeling really bad about myself
2014-11-11 09:17:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's not what I wanted. 
2014-11-11 09:18:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you!
2014-11-11 09:18:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you're amazing 
2014-11-11 09:18:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-11-11 09:18:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too
2014-11-11 10:27:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just explained gene regulation to my aunt and uncle and I think I nailed it 
2014-11-11 10:27:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well done!
2014-11-11 10:30:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]our conversation clusters are weird
2014-11-11 11:03:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we definitely have a sex cluster, though
2014-11-11 11:16:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Makes sense 
2014-11-11 11:16:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So a conversation is a block of messages that don't have more than an hour gap?
2014-11-11 11:16:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-11 11:17:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which might make the clustering weird
2014-11-11 11:17:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because we talk about different things
2014-11-11 11:17:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would cluster messages 1st maybe
2014-11-11 11:18:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then look for "clusters" of the same date within the clusters 
2014-11-11 11:18:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I did some message clustering
2014-11-11 11:19:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but the messages are so short that I'm not sure how well it can cluster
2014-11-11 11:19:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll try it again, though
2014-11-11 11:20:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm. Maybe you can concatenate back to back messages for each of us? 
2014-11-11 11:20:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like if you send 5 texts within a short time span, those all can be 1 message for you
2014-11-11 11:21:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That shouldn't be too hard to automate
2014-11-11 11:21:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, good idea
2014-11-11 11:22:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Otherwise you'll get a giant cluster of "ok" and "yeah" lol
2014-11-11 11:23:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, right
2014-11-11 11:25:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's a cluster of us talking about travelling
2014-11-11 11:25:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's kind of interesting
2014-11-11 11:31:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we have a pizza clutser
2014-11-11 11:31:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cluster
2014-11-11 11:31:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-11-11 11:41:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yesssss
2014-11-11 11:42:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can talk about the pizza cluster in your paper
2014-11-11 11:42:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's pretty weird that it got it's own cluster
2014-11-11 11:42:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's only like 7 "conversations" in it
2014-11-11 11:43:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they're all short
2014-11-11 11:43:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like < 7 messages total
2014-11-11 11:50:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm
2014-11-11 12:52:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your dad called 
2014-11-11 12:52:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lol
2014-11-11 12:54:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha why?
2014-11-11 12:54:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sout the stocking 
2014-11-11 12:55:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ugh. My parents are ridiculous.
2014-11-11 12:56:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] A little bit 
2014-11-11 12:57:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Don't feel like you have to appease them.
2014-11-11 12:57:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And if anything ever really bothers you let me know and I'll tell them to back off.
2014-11-11 12:58:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Don't ever let me get like that please.
2014-11-11 12:58:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The bike ride to campus was one of the least enjoyable things I've ever experienced.
2014-11-11 12:58:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Windchill was in the 30s.
2014-11-11 13:00:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh lord you've got a double whammy error in your Facebook post.
2014-11-11 13:00:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You have a typo on bad grammar haha.
2014-11-11 13:01:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well maybe not. There's definitely a typo, but I don't know what you were trying to say.
2014-11-11 15:12:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tough crowd! It's totally understandable what I meant 
2014-11-11 15:12:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you mean could of?
2014-11-11 15:29:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah

2014-11-11 15:53:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that seems like more work
2014-11-11 15:54:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]apparently, we have to give a more minute presentation on our project idea on Tuesday
2014-11-11 15:54:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hopefully my flight doesn't get delayed!

2014-11-11 16:38:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The AAA guy was impressed by my legs

2014-11-11 17:59:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nope
2014-11-11 18:22:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oops that's small
2014-11-11 18:26:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you seem to sende longer messages
2014-11-11 18:26:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I think we knew
2014-11-11 18:42:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Duh
2014-11-11 18:42:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's still interesting!
2014-11-11 18:42:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you need science to confirm common sense!
2014-11-11 19:37:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it looks like you have a fair amount of super negative messages
2014-11-11 19:37:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that are bringing down your average
2014-11-11 19:38:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]50% of your messages are below a sentiment score of 0.4490182
2014-11-11 19:38:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]while 50% of mine are below 0.4682864
2014-11-11 19:39:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it seems like I am more negative than you in general
2014-11-11 19:39:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but when you're negative you're extremely negative
2014-11-11 19:45:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have a bigger "vocabulary" than I do
2014-11-11 19:45:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]10733 to 11792
2014-11-11 20:50:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a lot bigger 
2014-11-11 20:55:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]some of these "positive" convos are clearly misses
2014-11-11 20:55:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2014-09-08 23:20:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey honey 2014-09-08 23:21:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hey.

Was reading some Lolita. 2014-09-08 23:22:39[SEP]Michael A.

Alcorn[SEP]That's cool. 2014-09-08 23:31:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I guess I'll leave you to your reading 2014-09-08 23:32:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you! 2014-09-08 23:32:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Love you too. 2014-09-08 23:35:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are we ok? 2014-09-08 23:53:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. 2014-09-08 23:55:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K 2014-09-08 23:57:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Night
2014-11-11 20:56:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well it was positive 
2014-11-11 20:56:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it is like one of the top ones
2014-11-11 20:56:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did we talk on the phone after?
2014-11-11 20:56:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure.
2014-11-11 20:56:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It doesn't seem positive to me.
2014-11-11 20:57:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was trying to be positive lol
2014-11-11 20:57:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I know
2014-11-11 20:57:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a good point
2014-11-11 20:57:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that probably drove it up
2014-11-11 20:57:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I didn't have any negative words
2014-11-11 20:57:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]although you can tell I'm being grumpy
2014-11-11 20:57:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely 
2014-11-11 20:58:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this was is so wrong
2014-11-11 20:59:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this *one
2014-11-11 20:59:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from September 9th
2014-11-11 20:59:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we talk about getting proposed
2014-11-11 20:59:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then a lot of sexy talk
2014-11-11 20:59:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like a lot of sexy talk
2014-11-11 21:00:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if words like dick, pussy, penis, cock are used negatively typically
2014-11-11 21:00:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on Twitter
2014-11-11 21:00:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ass
2014-11-11 21:03:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the individual messages seem like they did a better job
2014-11-11 21:35:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we have a music cluster when using your idea    😃 
2014-11-11 21:45:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-11-11 22:02:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let me shower real quick
2014-11-11 22:02:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless you're gonna be doing something?
2014-11-11 22:03:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]probably not
2014-11-11 22:03:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK

2014-11-11 23:35:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dick
2014-11-11 23:38:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] 😑 
2014-11-11 23:39:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] 😀 
2014-11-12 00:24:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Say what you will about the flaws in the long distance part of our relationship, but at least we bounce back well 
2014-11-12 00:24:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which is impressive, given we didn't have any lovey physical contact to help 
2014-11-12 00:25:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) I agree. And I was gonna serve you these before you sent me those.
2014-11-12 00:25:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]4) I love how you want me to be happy.
2014-11-12 00:26:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-11-12 00:26:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]5) I love your ass.
2014-11-12 00:26:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's not a new one 
2014-11-12 00:26:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think any of them are new.
2014-11-12 00:26:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the picnic one is.
2014-11-12 00:27:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you writing these down someehere? 
2014-11-12 00:27:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yes
2014-11-12 00:27:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Guess I'll have to make a nice enumerated list too 
2014-11-12 00:28:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Actually, send me a snap of your booty.
2014-11-12 00:28:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you should stick to 1 a day, otherwise you'll run out soon 
2014-11-12 00:28:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dudeeeeee
2014-11-12 00:28:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm already under the covers 
2014-11-12 00:29:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Booty snaps require some complicated arm and/or mirror placement 
2014-11-12 00:29:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't care. I want to see your ass now.
2014-11-12 00:32:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhh ok
2014-11-12 00:34:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's the best you're gonna get tonight
2014-11-12 00:34:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That'll do.
2014-11-12 00:35:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can't wait to fuck you Friday night.
2014-11-12 00:35:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should be more realistic 
2014-11-12 00:36:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The second you're in Chicago I'll have zero desire to keep dancing fully clothed 
2014-11-12 00:36:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What?
2014-11-12 00:36:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh haha.
2014-11-12 00:37:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't get me horny before bed!
2014-11-12 00:40:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll make you horny when I want.
2014-11-12 00:41:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm going to go so deep inside you.
2014-11-12 00:42:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Bite on your ass a little bit.
2014-11-12 00:43:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Push you up against the wall from behind.
2014-11-12 00:45:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Put my arms over me head
2014-11-12 00:46:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sucking and nibbling my tits
2014-11-12 00:46:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're the worst 
2014-11-12 00:46:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-11-12 07:40:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we should both go through like 20% of the messages and give them sentiment scores? 
2014-11-12 07:41:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And make our own training set 
2014-11-12 07:59:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oooo and then in our app, if you do the analysis and don't like some of the ouput you can make your own "training set"
2014-11-12 07:59:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and we can keep that data (if they allow it of course) to both improve the app and NLP!
2014-11-12 08:39:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, having our own training set would be ideal. Maybe just scan some positive and negative messages and look for odd ones and determine which words are throwing off the results and then retrain those words? I think it's mostly the sex stuff that is being misclassified.
2014-11-12 08:52:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]truth
2014-11-12 09:03:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Darcy and Jim have officially broken up apparently
2014-11-12 09:03:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man. How's she doing?
2014-11-12 09:04:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]she just mentioned it in passing this morning
2014-11-12 09:04:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but she seemed to be having an ok time with Colin last night so I dunno
2014-11-12 09:05:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah? I thought they had a bit of chemistry, but that seems risky, unless they're both down with that rebound game.
2014-11-12 09:10:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lol maybe
2014-11-12 09:10:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]they were sitting close on the couch
2014-11-12 09:10:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and Colin hung out at Haley's the other night and gave her the distinct impression he didn't want to go home
2014-11-12 09:10:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]not necessarily in a sexual way though, maybe he's just lonely
2014-11-12 09:11:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure. That's a big change in your life.
2014-11-12 09:24:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]seriously
2014-11-12 09:24:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]let's never break up, k?
2014-11-12 09:25:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha I guesssss
2014-11-12 09:34:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sexWords = ["ass", "dick", "cock", "pussy", "cum", "spank"]
2014-11-12 09:34:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what other sex words do you think I should boost as positive?
2014-11-12 09:35:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]titties
2014-11-12 09:35:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]tits
2014-11-12 09:35:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-11-12 09:36:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]though those may be positive on twitter more than the others lol
2014-11-12 09:36:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]suck!
2014-11-12 09:36:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bet that's usually negative
2014-11-12 09:36:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]though we may use it negative too sometimes
2014-11-12 09:36:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tits actually has a higher neg probability
2014-11-12 09:36:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on Twitter
2014-11-12 09:36:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hmm maybe that should be 50/50
2014-11-12 09:36:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]suck definitely does
2014-11-12 09:36:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]suck?
2014-11-12 09:36:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-11-12 09:37:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sometimes we say "Rhat sucks"
2014-11-12 09:37:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was wondering about fuck too
2014-11-12 09:37:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sometimes we say we want to suck the other person's cock/titties
2014-11-12 09:37:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]fuck should maybe be 75/25 happy/sad
2014-11-12 09:38:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think?
2014-11-12 09:38:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]guesses, but probably better thn twiiter
2014-11-12 09:38:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a quick scan made it look not that biased
2014-11-12 09:38:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]on twitter?
2014-11-12 09:38:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or for us?
2014-11-12 09:39:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]us
2014-11-12 09:39:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I take that back
2014-11-12 09:39:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's used for emphasis a lot
2014-11-12 09:39:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in both a positive and negative way
2014-11-12 09:39:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-11-12 09:39:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then when it's used for sex it's purely orgasmically positive    😉 
2014-11-12 09:39:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha 
2014-11-12 09:41:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do either of us use dick or cock negatively?
2014-11-12 09:42:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]nah
2014-11-12 09:42:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might use dick like twice negatively
2014-11-12 09:42:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]saying like, Dallas is a Dick
2014-11-12 09:43:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah maybe
2014-11-12 09:43:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how's this list?
2014-11-12 09:43:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sexWords = {"ass": 0.75, "dick": 0.8, "cock": 0.95, "pussy": 0.99, "cum": 0.99, "spank": 0.8, "tit": 0.99, "suck": 0.5,              "fuck": 0.75, "clit": 0.99}
2014-11-12 09:43:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's the probability they're positive
2014-11-12 10:14:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ass is probably higher
2014-11-12 10:14:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like .8
2014-11-12 10:14:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but yeah

2014-11-12 10:49:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm actually going over these discussion clusters with more focus and they aren't too bad.
2014-11-12 10:49:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We actually have a gushy/sappy/lovey cluster
2014-11-12 10:49:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-12 10:49:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty cute

2014-11-12 12:50:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]using messages <= 3 minutes apart just clusters on invidual words
2014-11-12 12:50:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like "gotcha"
2014-11-12 12:50:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or "love"
2014-11-12 12:50:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or "true"
2014-11-12 14:17:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we got easier to tell apart
2014-11-12 17:42:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Interesting 
2014-11-12 17:42:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why you no call me back when you got home?
2014-11-12 17:42:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just got home!
2014-11-12 17:42:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]want me to call you?
2014-11-12 17:42:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't love me 
2014-11-12 17:43:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:((((
2014-11-12 17:43:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha no, I'm about to go to dinner

2014-11-12 17:49:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WTF
2014-11-12 19:35:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think my weekly sentiment score code was doing what I thought it was doing before
2014-11-12 19:36:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This is what it should look like, which I think is pretty interesting.
2014-11-12 19:36:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There are spikes right before we're about to visit each other    😃 
2014-11-12 19:42:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Whoops, I didn't add the last week.
2014-11-12 19:42:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This is what it looks like:
2014-11-12 19:42:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not as dire, haha.

2014-11-13 09:01:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking about you last night and it's crazy how amazing you make me feel and just how awesome of a person you are. I'm so lucky to have found you and I couldn't be happier to spend the rest of my life with you.
2014-11-13 09:02:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know how to respond over text to stuff like that!
2014-11-13 09:03:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you don't need to respond with anything. Just wanted to let you know    😃 
2014-11-13 09:03:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It makes me want to jump up and down 
2014-11-13 09:04:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even though a minute ago I couldn't even keep my eyes open 
2014-11-13 09:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] haha aw I like that response!
2014-11-13 09:06:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Only 1.6 more days!
2014-11-13 09:06:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yessss
2014-11-13 09:23:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will you help me throw the pumpkins away this weekend?
2014-11-13 09:23:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that code for "will you throw away the pumpkins this weekend?"
2014-11-13 09:24:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's why you're my soulmate :)
2014-11-13 09:24:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-11-13 09:53:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess there won't be too much eating in this week
2014-11-13 09:53:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still want to make you some fancy Mac and cheese 
2014-11-13 09:54:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well we've got a whole month together soon for you to make that happen
2014-11-13 09:54:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True 
2014-11-13 09:54:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just figuring out what to get at the store for you 
2014-11-13 09:55:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah we don't really have to cover too many meals this trip
2014-11-13 10:11:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I found where we can go for our date on Monday 
2014-11-13 10:11:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm too excitedddd I can't get work done 
2014-11-13 10:11:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha awe
2014-11-13 10:11:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where are we going?
2014-11-13 10:17:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This place Quay. It's kinda fancy inside, and some of its stuff is ridiculously expensive, but you can get 3 tasty smaller things for like $35 to share. 
2014-11-13 10:17:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good    😃 
2014-11-13 10:18:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fancy
2014-11-13 10:19:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Orrr if there's s MNF game you want to watch, they have a bar too with the same food
2014-11-13 10:20:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah
2014-11-13 10:21:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna enjoy watching your bliss.
2014-11-13 10:21:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha dork 
2014-11-13 10:21:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to make you appreciate food 
2014-11-13 10:22:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Even if it takes our whole lives 
2014-11-13 10:22:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sounds good
2014-11-13 10:22:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm the one that recommended Purple Pig!
2014-11-13 10:22:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's true!
2014-11-13 10:23:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't really not appreciate food, you just also don't set it as a priority 
2014-11-13 10:23:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I can agree with that
2014-11-13 13:03:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fuck everything about that bike ride.
2014-11-13 14:13:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:(
2014-11-13 15:40:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I forgot to tell you another thing that annoyed me about my dad when he was here. I said I was really busy this semester and he said "Well you're taking a lot of trips to Chicago" and was completely serious, lol.
2014-11-13 16:12:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well that is part of the reason you're busy I guess 
2014-11-13 16:12:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it's not a bad reason to be busy 
2014-11-13 16:18:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't really see it as a cause of me being busy. I've only lost six workdays at this point from visits, which I've more than made up for by working late almost nightly and working on the weekends.
2014-11-13 16:27:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth 
2014-11-13 18:36:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who's David??
2014-11-13 18:36:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did not mean to have 2 ?
2014-11-13 18:36:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the guy I rent from
2014-11-13 18:39:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah 
2014-11-13 18:39:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll have to check it out after evmorph 
2014-11-13 18:59:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jk I ain't going to evmorph 
2014-11-13 18:59:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is super fun 
2014-11-13 18:59:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-11-13 18:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The song 
2014-11-13 18:59:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah for sure
2014-11-13 18:59:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why aren't you going to EvMorph?
2014-11-13 19:00:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wanted to, it's this guy at MBL doing awesome cephalopod chromatophore stuff
2014-11-13 19:00:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm tired and really need to do laundry before tm 
2014-11-13 19:01:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, word.
2014-11-13 19:01:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a pretty productive day too 
2014-11-13 19:01:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I feel a little justified calling it quits at 7pm lol
2014-11-13 19:01:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha good for you
2014-11-13 19:04:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was thinking, we shouldn't do mailed wedding invitations 
2014-11-13 19:04:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's such a waste of time, paper, and money 
2014-11-13 19:04:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd rather spend all that money on food 
2014-11-13 19:04:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-11-13 19:05:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are they really that expensive?
2014-11-13 19:05:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](I'm totally down)
2014-11-13 19:05:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I knew you would be, that's why I want to marry you 
2014-11-13 19:05:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, one of many many reasons 
2014-11-13 19:05:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice save
2014-11-13 19:06:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But yeah, you usually send a "Save the Date" and then the actual invitation, with a stamped envelope enclosed for their response 
2014-11-13 19:06:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And monogrammed shit is expensive 
2014-11-13 19:06:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On nice paper 
2014-11-13 19:06:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'm just wondering like how much?
2014-11-13 19:08:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Apparently between 2-7 per invitation 
2014-11-13 19:08:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So if we invite 120 ppl that's like 300
2014-11-13 19:09:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure how much food that'll buy, though
2014-11-13 19:09:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So maybe not as expensive as I thought lol, but still wasteful 
2014-11-13 19:09:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I agree it's wasteful, but so is a lot of shit
2014-11-13 19:09:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-13 19:09:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]people seem to get a kick out of them
2014-11-13 19:09:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm down with not having them
2014-11-13 19:10:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meh
2014-11-13 19:10:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought they'd save like $500 
2014-11-13 19:10:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or more 
2014-11-13 19:12:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so is not having them less appealing now?
2014-11-13 19:12:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're not gonna have anything left to plan by the time I propose to you
2014-11-13 19:12:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-13 19:22:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's the plan ;)
2014-11-13 19:23:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wonder if maybe once your hear and we live together, I'll feel less of a "rush" 
2014-11-13 19:24:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess in my mind, being married involves all the parts of a serious relationship that we can't have yet 
2014-11-13 19:24:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like what?
2014-11-13 19:24:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sleeping together every night 
2014-11-13 19:25:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you not do that with past boyfriends?
2014-11-13 19:25:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fully integrating our lives together 
2014-11-13 19:25:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Certainly not every night 
2014-11-13 19:25:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you worked weird hours.
2014-11-13 19:25:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess cam and I probably averaged like 3 times a week 
2014-11-13 19:25:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But that's kinda surprising to me.
2014-11-13 19:26:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I guess that can be explained by your work schedule then
2014-11-13 19:26:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A little bit
2014-11-13 19:26:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I also went out with my friends without cam and so he didn't come back with me 
2014-11-13 19:27:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'm focusing more on the "integrating lives" part 
2014-11-13 19:28:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what do you mean with that?
2014-11-13 19:29:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just meant but all this that if you lived here and we did sleep together every night and eat together and all that stuff, I wouldn't feel as big a desire to get married immediately 
2014-11-13 19:29:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because getting married wouldn't change things much 
2014-11-13 19:30:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah I see
2014-11-13 19:30:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that makes sense
2014-11-13 19:30:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe you won't even want to get married then
2014-11-13 19:30:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-13 19:30:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Noooo
2014-11-13 19:30:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just might not be fantasizing about it as much pre-proposal 
2014-11-13 19:31:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you're adorable
2014-11-13 19:31:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it Friday yet?
2014-11-13 19:31:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Almost!
2014-11-13 19:31:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]7) I love that you want our lives to be “integrated”.
2014-11-13 19:32:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]8) I love that you fantasize about our wedding and being married to me.
2014-11-13 19:35:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]1) I love that you love those things about me, because it means you want them too :(
2014-11-13 19:35:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*:)
2014-11-13 19:35:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-11-13 19:36:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]throwing off your sentiment score, man!

2014-11-13 21:35:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some of the soap scum is like permanently on there 
2014-11-13 21:35:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha sick
2014-11-13 21:36:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]However, it turns out that the shower doors aren't frosted lol

2014-11-13 21:42:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-11-13 21:43:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it's also pretty annoeing

2014-11-13 21:44:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was just hangouts 
2014-11-13 21:44:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's weird

2014-11-13 21:50:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha

2014-11-13 21:51:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]B 08
2014-11-13 21:51:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not bad
2014-11-13 21:51:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for being an hour late
2014-11-13 21:51:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]over an hour late
2014-11-13 21:51:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I can always play TwoDots on my iPad 
2014-11-13 21:51:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can actually do pretty much anything with my phone on the iPad 
2014-11-13 21:51:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's true
2014-11-13 21:51:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it won't be on your phone
2014-11-13 21:52:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can have my iPad by my bedside  table too lol
2014-11-13 21:52:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean when you're not home
2014-11-13 21:52:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I prefer Android
2014-11-13 21:52:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you're used to iOS
2014-11-13 21:53:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I don't know if you'd get more out of Android
2014-11-13 21:53:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had an android 1st and loved it
2014-11-13 21:53:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh really?
2014-11-13 21:53:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you might've told me that
2014-11-13 21:53:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Htc Aria I think 
2014-11-13 21:53:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-11-13 21:54:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some of the recent changes to iOS have not impressed me
2014-11-13 21:54:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the latest version of Android is really nice, in my opinion
2014-11-13 21:54:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Closing out of apps running in the background is really obnoxious 
2014-11-13 21:54:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lollipop
2014-11-13 21:54:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I'll get an iPhone 5 for free
2014-11-13 21:55:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then when you get a job, I'll get your nexus and we can sell the iPhone 5
2014-11-13 21:55:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think you can sell the phones on contract, right?
2014-11-13 21:55:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're locked
2014-11-13 21:55:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh
2014-11-13 21:55:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can't I unlock it?
2014-11-13 21:55:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or is that illegal?
2014-11-13 21:56:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]um
2014-11-13 21:56:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure
2014-11-13 21:56:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK no
2014-11-13 21:56:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]AT&T won't let you if the device hasn't been paid for in full
2014-11-13 21:56:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you can still do it
2014-11-13 21:56:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm pretty sure it's illegal
2014-11-13 21:57:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha well maybe not then 
2014-11-13 21:57:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I can get that phone you really want for cheaper and then we can switch 
2014-11-13 21:57:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want the next version of that phone
2014-11-13 21:57:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not out yet
2014-11-13 21:57:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even know if I'll get it
2014-11-13 21:57:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this phone is really nice
2014-11-13 21:58:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's a huge upgrade over my old one
2014-11-13 21:58:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I'll go to an ATT store and just look around and hold stuff
2014-11-13 21:58:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]See what I like 
2014-11-13 21:58:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then what?

2014-11-13 22:01:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should've made some chili like I said 
2014-11-13 22:01:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when did you say that?
2014-11-13 22:01:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like a while ago?

2014-11-13 22:03:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you should mix it up even if you have the car 
2014-11-13 22:03:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I can eat fast food if I have a car
2014-11-13 22:03:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't eat drive thru every night!

2014-11-14 00:13:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A winter hat?
2014-11-14 00:13:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-11-14 00:14:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've been wearing one here.
2014-11-14 00:14:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want you to freeze to death doing public transport 
2014-11-14 00:14:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I'm gonna do the ol' double jacket too.
2014-11-14 00:16:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Guess what.
2014-11-14 00:16:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-11-14 00:17:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My deep learning course is getting out early tomorrow.
2014-11-14 00:17:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Of course it is
2014-11-14 00:17:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When did you find that out?
2014-11-14 00:20:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]today
2014-11-14 00:20:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a couple of hours ago
2014-11-14 00:20:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh well
2014-11-14 00:20:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Soon you won't have any Friday classes. 
2014-11-14 00:21:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or Thursday
2014-11-14 00:21:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would've liked to go that gala with you, though
2014-11-14 00:22:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would've liked you to come too. 
2014-11-14 00:22:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's one in the spring.
2014-11-14 00:22:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe we can shoot for that one then
2014-11-14 00:23:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-11-14 00:23:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can try not to get in a mini fight right before ;)
2014-11-14 00:24:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be nice
2014-11-14 00:25:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I might be not that attractive to you tomorrow
2014-11-14 00:25:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-14 00:26:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're the one that decided to leave your hair utensils here 
2014-11-14 00:26:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep
2014-11-14 00:31:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna get to sleep.
2014-11-14 00:32:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too
2014-11-14 00:32:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you, and so so excited to see you 
2014-11-14 00:32:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]love you too. Goodnight.
2014-11-14 07:40:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Today!
2014-11-14 08:50:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So excited!
2014-11-14 09:00:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe you could try to fly standby for the 5:20 flight
2014-11-14 09:00:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that would most likely end up sucking hardcore 
2014-11-14 09:01:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-11-14 09:02:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean you might not get on the flight and then you have to wait around for 3 hours 
2014-11-14 09:02:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh yeah. How does standby work?
2014-11-14 09:03:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you just go to the desk and ask if you can fly standby on the earlier flight. If you don't make it, you keep your flight 
2014-11-14 09:04:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is there a way to check how full the flight is?
2014-11-14 09:04:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not sold out online
2014-11-14 09:05:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And what desk?
2014-11-14 09:05:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The SWA desk at the airport
2014-11-14 09:06:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like check in?
2014-11-14 09:06:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or the gate?
2014-11-14 09:06:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Checkin
2014-11-14 09:07:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I looked it up, that's how it works
2014-11-14 09:07:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With no change in fare 
2014-11-14 09:07:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK I'll try for that.
2014-11-14 09:07:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The flight is at 5:30?
2014-11-14 09:08:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]5:20
2014-11-14 09:08:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What clothes should I bring if I make it?
2014-11-14 09:08:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhh wait
2014-11-14 09:08:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Let me call 
2014-11-14 09:08:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-11-14 09:22:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since we have "Wanna Get Away" tickets, you have to upgrade to "Anytine" to fly standby for free
2014-11-14 09:23:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless your flight is delayed more than 20 minutes 
2014-11-14 09:23:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it's a moot point because that flight just sold out while I was on the phone 
2014-11-14 09:23:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, OK
2014-11-14 09:23:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh well
2014-11-14 09:23:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No biggie
2014-11-14 09:25:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm up to 9 drinks already this week 
2014-11-14 09:26:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]looks like I'll win this week
2014-11-14 09:26:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I might go a bit over 15 with this gala and fsu
2014-11-14 09:26:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't make it a competition like that! 
2014-11-14 09:26:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then I'm encouraged not to drink 
2014-11-14 09:26:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We want this to be an accurate  average
2014-11-14 09:27:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha would that really stop you?
2014-11-14 09:27:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It almost did last night 
2014-11-14 09:27:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]From grabbing a beer while I was cleaning 
2014-11-14 09:27:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no shit
2014-11-14 09:27:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's funny
2014-11-14 09:28:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might've even subconsciously stopped me from pouring baileys in my coffee 
2014-11-14 09:28:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we'll never knoww
2014-11-14 09:28:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-11-14 09:28:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my prediction is that you'll go over 15 a few times and stop the log
2014-11-14 09:28:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]once you accept you drink a lot
2014-11-14 09:30:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude, stop biasing the experiment 
2014-11-14 09:31:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Actually, let's just stop talking about whether I'm an alcoholic until 3 months from now 
2014-11-14 09:31:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then we'll look at the data and see
2014-11-14 09:31:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Deal?
2014-11-14 09:31:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK
2014-11-14 09:32:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I promise to record faithfully until then 
2014-11-14 09:32:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though I think I probably averaged less than 7 drinks a week while in the field
2014-11-14 09:33:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]These are probably the most drinking heavy months 
2014-11-14 09:33:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the months from September to May?
2014-11-14 09:34:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Winter specifically 
2014-11-14 09:34:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And my birthday and Halloween 
2014-11-14 09:35:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm maybe
2014-11-14 09:35:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I honestly don't know why you care
2014-11-14 09:35:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you think it looks bad?
2014-11-14 09:35:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or something?
2014-11-14 09:39:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alcoholic has a pretty negative connotation 
2014-11-14 09:39:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're obviously not an alcoholic
2014-11-14 09:39:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It directly implies that I'm addicted to an unhealthy substance and its negatively impacting my life 
2014-11-14 09:39:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well maybe
2014-11-14 09:39:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well you keep saying I am! 
2014-11-14 09:40:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know what the clinical definition is
2014-11-14 09:40:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you drink a lot
2014-11-14 09:40:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I drink very much on par with my peers
2014-11-14 09:40:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who drink a lot
2014-11-14 09:40:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And at least with my Miami peers, drank less 
2014-11-14 09:40:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]these people are not normal
2014-11-14 09:41:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you probably had alcoholic friends in Miami
2014-11-14 09:41:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They are within the upper 30% of the population 
2014-11-14 09:41:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why does it matter? 
2014-11-14 09:41:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why do you comment on it so much?
2014-11-14 09:41:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't care
2014-11-14 09:41:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you brought it up this time
2014-11-14 09:41:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I care that you deny you drink a lot
2014-11-14 09:41:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess I can just let it go
2014-11-14 09:42:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let's not do the experiment
2014-11-14 09:42:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No we have to 
2014-11-14 09:42:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why?
2014-11-14 09:42:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's obnoxious
2014-11-14 09:42:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not going to prove anything
2014-11-14 09:43:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because you think I'm wrong and I think you're wrong, and both of us are a little annoyed or w/e that the other person has an incorrect view of reality 
2014-11-14 09:43:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't care
2014-11-14 09:43:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You just said you care 
2014-11-14 09:43:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said I did care
2014-11-14 09:43:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what started this thing
2014-11-14 09:43:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm over it
2014-11-14 09:44:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's obnoxious
2014-11-14 09:44:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You said "I care that you deny it@
2014-11-14 09:44:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you do a lot of drugs more than the majority of the population
2014-11-14 09:44:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who cares
2014-11-14 09:45:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just taking MDMA the few times I have this year probably puts me in the top 20% if not higher
2014-11-14 09:45:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you like being intoxicated
2014-11-14 09:45:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]embrace it
2014-11-14 09:49:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the evidence that the department is not representative of the population is the fact the department encourages binge drinking by financing the Hallowe'en party.
2014-11-14 09:49:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Drinking is pushed in that culture.
2014-11-14 09:53:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The department doesn't finance it, the BSD does 
2014-11-14 09:54:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm including essentially everyone I know from undergrad and high school by my "peers"
2014-11-14 09:54:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Elin and her friends in montana probably drinks wayyy more than anyone in the department 
2014-11-14 09:57:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you're right, let's drop it for now 
2014-11-14 10:11:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you realize an alcoholic could say the same thing?
2014-11-14 10:13:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"I don't drink more than my peers"
2014-11-14 10:14:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I concede because this is so fucking obnoxious. You don't drink a lot.
2014-11-14 10:15:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My perception was skewed because I drink very little and thus my perception of "normal" was inaccurate.
2014-11-14 10:15:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You drink a normal amount.
2014-11-14 10:16:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Don't ever tell me the results.
2014-11-14 10:16:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't want to know them.
2014-11-14 11:01:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Michael Anthony, you're being unnecessarily ridiculous. 
2014-11-14 11:09:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And kind of being a jerk. You are pushing your opinion on me and causing me to defend my position. I don't understand why you would get frustrated at me about that.
2014-11-14 12:18:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK, I'm sorry. I'm asking you to please not tell me the results, though. Nothing positive has come from this discussion.
2014-11-14 12:21:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-11-14 12:22:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]please don't call me an alcoholic again, even indirectly 
2014-11-14 12:24:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you like getting fucked up?
2014-11-14 12:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In any capacity?
2014-11-14 12:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did that offend you?
2014-11-14 12:43:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm trying to understand if that belief is inaccurate.
2014-11-14 13:52:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had lab meeting
2014-11-14 13:53:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but also, you seriously have a problem knowing when to drop things
2014-11-14 13:53:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]right after saying "Nothing positive has come from this conversation." you continue the conversation
2014-11-14 13:54:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do not like the word "alcoholic"
2014-11-14 13:54:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do not like when you imply I am one by comments like: Do you realize an alcoholic could say the same thing? "I don't drink more than my peers"
2014-11-14 13:55:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I'm asking you to please not do those things anymore
2014-11-14 13:57:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Apparently a safe word approach doesn't work very well
2014-11-14 13:58:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WTF you used my name and I stopped and then you had to have the final word.
2014-11-14 14:00:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You summed up how you want things to be going forward and I summed up how I wanted things to be going forward 
2014-11-14 14:00:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was not a "last word"
2014-11-14 14:00:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I don't think I ever said you are an alcoholic in earnest
2014-11-14 14:02:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well then it should be easy for you to avoid saying it in the future 
2014-11-14 14:02:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yup. I can't wait to never fucking talk about this shit again.
2014-11-14 14:03:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do not understand why you get so mad about this 
2014-11-14 14:04:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because it is obnoxious.
2014-11-14 14:05:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I literally could not care less if you drink more than other people. It was an observation that you think is wrong and it somehow turned into you defending the fact that you're not an alcoholic.
2014-11-14 14:19:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So it's my fault, I brought this topic up and drove it to the point of being obnoxious. I'm sorry.
2014-11-14 16:37:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-11-14 16:58:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too. Starting my trek to the airport.
2014-11-14 16:58:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Public transport?
2014-11-14 16:59:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. Takes about two hours.
2014-11-14 16:59:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude that's so silly 
2014-11-14 16:59:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's way too coldd
2014-11-14 17:00:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's not cold on the bus/in the train!
2014-11-14 17:03:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Damn. There was a route that left 25 minutes later that got there at the same time.
2014-11-14 17:23:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh that sounds so annoying 
2014-11-14 17:23:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha it's all good. There's a nice prize at the end ;)
2014-11-14 17:29:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]D'aww
2014-11-14 21:08:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meet me at my apt 
2014-11-14 22:08:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just landed. Still meet at your apartment?
2014-11-14 22:09:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes! I'll head there now 
2014-11-14 22:09:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you taking bus or lyft?
2014-11-14 22:09:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's up to you. If you want to stay I'll just take the bus.
2014-11-14 22:10:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The food was mediocre. I'll walk home now if you don't mind taking a Lyft/cab
2014-11-14 22:11:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's cool. So excited to see you :)
2014-11-14 22:13:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet! So text me when you're in a cab
2014-11-14 22:13:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-11-14 22:24:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]On my way.
2014-11-14 22:43:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Honeyyy
2014-11-14 22:43:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where are youuuu
2014-11-14 22:43:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]51st and Lake Park!
2014-11-15 17:22:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love youuuu
2014-11-15 17:23:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you already 
2014-11-15 17:24:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you too. Really hoping Auburn gets up big.
2014-11-15 17:24:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fingers crossed, but obvs I understand if you need to stay 
2014-11-15 17:25:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Was "obvs" one of my descriptive words?
2014-11-15 17:26:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't see it, but I'm sure it has to be.
2014-11-15 18:20:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The table thing is kind of a mess 
2014-11-15 18:25:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's the deal?
2014-11-15 18:27:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They said we'd get a table when the bama fans left 
2014-11-15 18:43:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that hasn't panned out yet 
2014-11-15 18:45:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:/ Auburn has had a couple of penalties go there was so far.
2014-11-15 19:03:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fuck you, Seminoles!
2014-11-15 19:03:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-11-15 19:06:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nailed it babe 
2014-11-15 19:41:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They gave our table away to my sorority sisters 
2014-11-15 19:41:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's pretty ducking ironic 
2014-11-15 19:42:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How did they give it away?
2014-11-15 19:42:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The bus boy thought they were me and Priya 
2014-11-15 19:42:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And grabbed them from the bar instead 
2014-11-15 19:43:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ugh. That's annoying as fuck.
2014-11-15 19:43:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol yes 
2014-11-15 19:43:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]At least y'all aren't playing like shit like we are.
2014-11-15 19:43:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So now we're waiting on another bama table that's been here since 2 and won't leave 
2014-11-15 19:44:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Damn.
2014-11-15 19:47:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's your game?
2014-11-15 19:47:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Shitty.
2014-11-15 19:48:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]17-7 halftime just started.
2014-11-15 19:48:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]-_-
2014-11-15 19:50:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What ethnicity is your quarterback?
2014-11-15 19:50:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]White?
2014-11-15 19:50:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No way.
2014-11-15 19:52:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We're thinking Pacific islander.
2014-11-15 19:53:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Y'all are looking good, though!
2014-11-15 19:54:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't jinx it
2014-11-15 20:04:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We got a table!
2014-11-15 20:06:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Whoop!
2014-11-15 20:07:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Looks like it's bad luck.
2014-11-15 20:07:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Come to mere
2014-11-15 20:09:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Let me feel a little shittier first.
2014-11-15 20:11:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love youuu
2014-11-15 20:27:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]3145 n Sheffield 
2014-11-15 20:27:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:):
2014-11-15 20:28:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My phone is about to die, but we're at the table to the left as you walk in, against the wall 
2014-11-15 20:28:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-11-15 20:28:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's our parking spot 
2014-11-15 21:08:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you on your way? 
2014-11-15 21:08:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-11-15 21:08:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Uber or bus?
2014-11-15 21:09:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lyft almost there.
2014-11-15 21:11:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cooool
2014-11-16 11:46:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://zippy.gfycat.com/EntireTiredBrahmanbull.mp4
2014-11-16 11:47:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hey
2014-11-17 10:53:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] They have breakfast sammies I got you 1
2014-11-17 10:53:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]thanks, sugar.
2014-11-17 10:53:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can still polish off the coffee cake though too
2014-11-17 10:53:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I will
2014-11-17 10:53:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha 
2014-11-17 15:29:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you want me to do?
2014-11-17 15:30:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You can watch it.
2014-11-17 15:30:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wgat you going to do?
2014-11-17 15:31:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just chill I guess.
2014-11-17 15:33:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would it be better in the bank?
2014-11-17 15:33:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Back
2014-11-17 15:33:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Don't worry about it.
2014-11-17 15:38:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are youn100!0"% sure?
2014-11-17 15:38:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can see it at home 
2014-11-17 15:39:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I don't mind.
2014-11-17 15:40:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm coming out 
2014-11-18 16:10:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Is your T-shirt size a small?
2014-11-18 16:10:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup
2014-11-18 16:11:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you get to class ok?
2014-11-18 16:14:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. I won best project idea so my professor said she'd by me a shirt, but they only have smalls or XLs right now for the style she was gonna buy me (UTD Engineering) so she asked if you might want one, which I thought was a cool idea.
2014-11-18 16:14:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you interested?
2014-11-18 16:15:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*buy
2014-11-18 16:45:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha sure!
2014-11-18 16:45:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Congrats on best project idea
2014-11-18 16:58:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks. Couldn't have done it without you ;)
2014-11-18 17:26:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How was the traveling?
2014-11-18 17:52:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not bad. Slept a decent amount on the plane, which is the first time that's happened I think.
2014-11-18 17:52:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I felt pretty rested.
2014-11-18 18:56:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-11-18 19:28:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]couch cuddling!
2014-11-18 19:28:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]wit da kitty?
2014-11-18 19:28:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]noooo
2014-11-18 19:28:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Darcy and Colin
2014-11-18 19:28:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think they thought I had band tonight
2014-11-18 19:28:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw snap!
2014-11-18 19:29:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]now I feel like I should vacate the premises or something
2014-11-18 19:29:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha whoops
2014-11-18 19:29:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]can you look at my cyclicSequencing code?
2014-11-18 19:30:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or are you busy?
2014-11-18 19:30:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is it not working?
2014-11-18 19:30:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it just takes fucking forever to run
2014-11-18 19:30:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, you need to look in the CS bonus
2014-11-18 19:30:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is what I was telling you
2014-11-18 19:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or appendix I should say
2014-11-18 19:31:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can't get the quiz done without implementing the algorithm in the appendix
2014-11-18 19:31:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it won't finish
2014-11-18 19:31:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's non-trivial too
2014-11-18 19:31:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the "How Fast is CyclopeptideSequencing?"
2014-11-18 19:31:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the difficulty really ramps up at this quiz
2014-11-18 19:31:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it comes out of nowhere
2014-11-18 19:32:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]umm
2014-11-18 19:32:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did the "Generating the Theoretical Spectrum of a Peptide"
2014-11-18 19:32:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-11-18 19:32:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh no, that's not it
2014-11-18 19:33:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you need to generate the neighborhood
2014-11-18 19:33:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which section are you in
2014-11-18 19:33:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ch. 2
2014-11-18 19:33:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]2.6
2014-11-18 19:33:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK. I was thinking you were in chapter 1
2014-11-18 19:34:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's your GitHub
2014-11-18 19:34:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]https://github.com/ksil91/Bioinformatics
2014-11-18 19:35:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where's yo code
2014-11-18 19:35:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just added it
2014-11-18 19:36:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I followed along with the pseudocode in 2.6 
2014-11-18 19:36:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think
2014-11-18 19:37:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you shouldn't use a list for your amino acids
2014-11-18 19:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure if that's the main bottleneck or not
2014-11-18 19:37:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what should I use?
2014-11-18 19:37:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a dictionary
2014-11-18 19:37:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you access elements in dictionary in constant time
2014-11-18 19:37:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where you're looping through an entire list right now
2014-11-18 19:38:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am using a dictionary for some of it
2014-11-18 19:38:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if it's the bottleneck or not
2014-11-18 19:38:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but for PreM
2014-11-18 19:38:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have two loops
2014-11-18 19:38:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one that loops through a list of length 20
2014-11-18 19:38:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which can add up
2014-11-18 19:38:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's what they said to do in the CS section!
2014-11-18 19:38:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]i don't have a second loop
2014-11-18 19:39:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lemme see yours then
2014-11-18 19:39:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you must've done something different
2014-11-18 19:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I used a dictionary
2014-11-18 19:40:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'll send you mine
2014-11-18 19:40:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you can ask me questions
2014-11-18 19:41:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually had to rewrite a bunch because they use fucking numbers for amino acids instead of the single letter representation
2014-11-18 19:41:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it didn't matter for most of the code
2014-11-18 19:41:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I could just convert it
2014-11-18 19:41:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah the output they want is pretty annoying
2014-11-18 19:41:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but like one of the last ones it's really tedious to convert
2014-11-18 19:41:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I had to change a bunch of code
2014-11-18 19:43:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-11-18 19:43:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this one of those ones they weren't clear on too
2014-11-18 19:43:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you need to use the linearSpectrum at times
2014-11-18 19:43:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that shouldn't be making your code super slow I don't think
2014-11-18 19:43:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd just give you the wrong answer
2014-11-18 19:46:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are other things you should be doing too that you should notice in my code
2014-11-18 19:48:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]did you email it to me?
2014-11-18 19:48:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-11-18 19:48:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]which email?
2014-11-18 19:48:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]uchicago
2014-11-18 19:49:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]got it
2014-11-18 19:50:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]prefixMasses = {}     prefixMasses[0] = 0
2014-11-18 19:50:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why did you set this as a dict and a list
2014-11-18 19:50:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or wait
2014-11-18 19:50:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you're just saying the 0 key in the dict is 0?
2014-11-18 19:50:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-11-18 19:50:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should've done that in one step actually
2014-11-18 19:51:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]as prefixMasses = {0: 0}
2014-11-18 19:58:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't know you could refer to dictionary items as numbers like that
2014-11-18 19:58:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just the key
2014-11-18 19:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]mm
2014-11-18 20:00:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why do you initialize PrefixMass = 0?
2014-11-18 20:01:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don;t think you use it again
2014-11-18 20:01:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you right
2014-11-18 20:01:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I said
2014-11-18 20:01:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had to change a bunch of code
2014-11-18 20:02:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so there might be remnants of the way I was doing it before in there
2014-11-18 20:05:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]does this return a sorted cyclisspectrum, or does it not mmatter anymore?
2014-11-18 20:05:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no
2014-11-18 20:05:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it returns a dictionary
2014-11-18 20:06:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is a byproduct of the way I was doing it before
2014-11-18 20:06:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I don't think is necessarily better
2014-11-18 20:06:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah it's probably a little more efficient to do what you do
2014-11-18 20:06:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not much
2014-11-18 20:06:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because Python does the comparing for you
2014-11-18 20:07:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I explicitly do it
2014-11-18 20:07:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and Python probably has that optimized
2014-11-18 20:15:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]meh I'll finish it tomorrow
2014-11-18 20:15:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I lost my steam
2014-11-18 20:15:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what're you up to?
2014-11-18 20:15:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]trying to figure out what I'm actually supposed to be doing on this homework assignment for NLP
2014-11-18 20:16:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]funnnnn
2014-11-18 20:17:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you miss me yet?
2014-11-18 20:17:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so so so much
2014-11-18 20:17:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need your warmthhh
2014-11-18 20:17:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-11-18 20:17:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was about to say
2014-11-18 20:17:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that seemed a little more emphatic than usual
2014-11-18 20:18:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what??
2014-11-18 20:18:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I always miss you a lot
2014-11-18 20:18:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and am usually very emphatic about it
2014-11-18 20:18:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I guess that's true
2014-11-18 20:18:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's more other things you downplay
2014-11-18 20:18:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're usually pretty genuine about missing me
2014-11-18 20:19:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]psh I'm always genuine
2014-11-18 20:19:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha riiiiight
2014-11-18 20:20:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you miss me?
2014-11-18 20:20:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep!
2014-11-18 20:20:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I got to talk about you today in front of a bunch of people, though. So that was kinda fun.
2014-11-18 20:21:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and the teacher really does like it!
2014-11-18 20:21:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well the students like it
2014-11-18 20:22:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they voted
2014-11-18 20:22:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but she likes it too based on the feedback she gave me on my proposal
2014-11-18 20:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there honestly wasn't any competitoin
2014-11-18 20:22:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-11-18 20:22:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's kind of a shitty gift to give if it won't fot the majority of the students in the class
2014-11-18 20:23:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she told the class to vote and that the winner would get a prize
2014-11-18 20:23:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not some secret
2014-11-18 20:23:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I don't really know what you're saying?
2014-11-18 20:24:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]she should've picked a different prize
2014-11-18 20:24:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why?
2014-11-18 20:24:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]not very many ppl in the class are probably small or XL
2014-11-18 20:25:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well she told me she could get me something else from the bookstore
2014-11-18 20:25:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought getting you the shirt was a good idea
2014-11-18 20:25:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my bad
2014-11-18 20:26:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]nooooo it is!
2014-11-18 20:26:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm happy to have a shirt from your school
2014-11-18 20:26:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"I won best project idea so my professor said she'd by me a shirt, but they only have smalls or XLs right now for the style she was gonna buy"
2014-11-18 20:26:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]this just seemed like overall poor planning on her part
2014-11-18 20:27:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but it works out for me, so it's all good
2014-11-18 20:27:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not poor planning
2014-11-18 20:27:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like I'm misrepresenting her?
2014-11-18 20:27:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]nevermind, I'm misunderstanding something
2014-11-18 20:30:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love youuu
2014-11-18 20:30:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love youuu toooo
2014-11-18 20:32:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you get that email I just forwarded you?
2014-11-18 20:34:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]small men's is fine
2014-11-18 20:34:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-11-18 20:34:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what were the other projects about?
2014-11-18 20:34:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lame as fuck
2014-11-18 20:34:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there was zero creativity
2014-11-18 20:34:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there were 43 projects and it felt like at least half of them were Twitter sentiment analysis
2014-11-18 20:35:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lame
2014-11-18 20:35:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one was about doing sentiment analysis on the Texas Rangers
2014-11-18 20:35:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it wasn't really clear how they were going to do it
2014-11-18 20:35:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the person wasn't there
2014-11-18 20:36:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it was just a recording of them describing the project
2014-11-18 20:36:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and another project was trying to do a sarcasm detector
2014-11-18 20:36:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from text
2014-11-18 20:36:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]using a naive Bayes classifier
2014-11-18 20:36:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I just don't think that'd work
2014-11-18 20:38:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you're so smart
2014-11-18 20:41:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wanted to hang out with Haley (so I can leave the love birds alone)
2014-11-18 20:41:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but she won't be leaving campus until after 9
2014-11-18 20:41:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you're just being awkward
2014-11-18 20:41:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I'm afraid I'll get sleepyyy
2014-11-18 20:41:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm in my room
2014-11-18 20:42:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I have to pee
2014-11-18 20:42:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but the movie ended like 10 minutes ago
2014-11-18 20:42:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what?
2014-11-18 20:42:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]soooo it's awfully quiet out there
2014-11-18 20:42:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-11-18 20:43:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they can't expect you to not have to use the bathroom
2014-11-18 20:43:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just open the door and take a second to walk out
2014-11-18 20:46:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]awkward laughing
2014-11-18 20:46:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and giggling
2014-11-18 20:46:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't do it
2014-11-18 20:46:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha come onnnn
2014-11-18 20:46:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're such a wimp
2014-11-18 20:47:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd feel bad
2014-11-18 20:47:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they can keep making out as soon as you're done
2014-11-18 22:20:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]whered you go??
2014-11-18 22:43:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't like when you indicated that lying around in bed with me all afternoon falls in the category of "boring anyways" 
2014-11-18 22:45:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. That was poor word choice on my part.
2014-11-18 22:45:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry.
2014-11-18 22:46:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's ok
2014-11-18 22:47:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It bummed me out a little but I figured you didn't mean it as harshly as it came out
2014-11-18 22:48:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I enjoyed that afternoon more than you did too, which feels a little lame
2014-11-18 22:49:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why is it lamte?
2014-11-18 22:49:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*lame
2014-11-18 22:49:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you were having fun
2014-11-18 22:49:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or enjoying yourself
2014-11-18 22:50:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said it was enjoyable
2014-11-18 22:50:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I honestly remember like one thing
2014-11-18 22:50:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]making eggs
2014-11-18 22:50:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we had sex too
2014-11-18 22:50:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't remember it
2014-11-18 22:50:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]huh
2014-11-18 22:50:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wonder why you don't remember that much
2014-11-18 22:51:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you remember?
2014-11-18 22:52:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]having sex, cuddling in different positions, asking you togo make eggs, having breakfast burritos and cutting up cheese, trying to give the cats egg(and their funny reactions)
2014-11-18 22:52:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK I said I remember making eggs
2014-11-18 22:52:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant at that point after
2014-11-18 22:52:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when I was fairly sobered up
2014-11-18 22:52:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was still pretty stoned while making the eggs
2014-11-18 22:53:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we mostly had sex in missionary
2014-11-18 22:53:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you started touching me while we were spooning
2014-11-18 22:54:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I pretty much remember the entire time
2014-11-18 22:54:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean
2014-11-18 22:54:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know
2014-11-18 22:54:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how long were we in bed?
2014-11-18 22:55:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I suppose there's not a lot to remember
2014-11-18 22:55:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and my saying I don't remember it doesn't really mean anything I suppose
2014-11-18 22:55:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]after smoking, like an hour and a half
2014-11-18 22:55:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because how much do I remember of any other day on that trip?
2014-11-18 22:55:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably not a lot
2014-11-18 22:55:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ok
2014-11-18 22:56:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure we'll have plenty of days like that and I'm sure I'll want to smoke more
2014-11-18 22:56:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you don't have to, really
2014-11-18 22:57:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]just as long as you don't make me feel like a lazy bum in comparision    😉 
2014-11-18 22:57:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm OK
2014-11-18 22:57:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we just need to get me some coke
2014-11-18 22:58:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]because you want to do that every day?
2014-11-18 22:58:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe
2014-11-18 22:58:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like a lot of people like to
2014-11-18 22:59:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]a lot of people like to drink every day, and smoke every day which doesn't affect your desire to do those things
2014-11-18 22:59:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why does it for coke
2014-11-18 23:00:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]something you've never tried
2014-11-18 23:00:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if it will
2014-11-18 23:00:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's why I said maybe
2014-11-18 23:00:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if it gets you amped up
2014-11-18 23:00:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean I don't really want to be relying on a drug every day
2014-11-18 23:01:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/01/140120173338.htm
2014-11-18 23:01:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have no interest in drinking coffee every day for the same reason
2014-11-18 23:01:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]coffee is good for you!
2014-11-18 23:01:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]regular drug use is bad
2014-11-18 23:01:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know this
2014-11-18 23:01:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]regular coffee is good for you
2014-11-18 23:02:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]says numerous studies
2014-11-18 23:02:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pot?
2014-11-18 23:02:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really want to rely on coffee to wake up in the morning
2014-11-18 23:02:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was my point with that
2014-11-18 23:02:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I don't want to rely on weed to cope with boredom
2014-11-18 23:03:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There is a stark difference from relying on weed to cope with boredom, and choosing to smoke every once in a while
2014-11-18 23:03:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's my point?
2014-11-18 23:04:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'm not sure why you said that about pot in the forst place
2014-11-18 23:04:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]said what?
2014-11-18 23:04:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]do you think I rely on pot to cope with boredom?
2014-11-18 23:04:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was making a comparison to coffee
2014-11-18 23:05:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]coffee is more addictive than coke
2014-11-18 23:05:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*pot
2014-11-18 23:05:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so what
2014-11-18 23:06:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're going to become a cokehead
2014-11-18 23:06:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and it's going to be awk
2014-11-18 23:06:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we don't even know if I'll like it
2014-11-18 23:06:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'm pretty sure I could function with a drug habit
2014-11-18 23:07:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you've already decided you're going to love it
2014-11-18 23:07:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it seems like I'd enjoy it
2014-11-18 23:07:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the ways I've seen it represented
2014-11-18 23:07:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and what I know about myself
2014-11-18 23:07:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I'm sure you could function too, but you'll be a different person than you are now
2014-11-18 23:07:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and I like who you are now
2014-11-18 23:09:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much is 1 g of cocaine per month
2014-11-18 23:09:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There's a reason that the people coke is represented with are always jerks
2014-11-18 23:09:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because they were probably jerks to begin with?
2014-11-18 23:09:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which probably says something about why I think I'd like it?
2014-11-18 23:09:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-18 23:10:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]even in the movie we watched last night, he was way way more of a jerk after he started doing drugs
2014-11-18 23:10:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]a gram might last you like 3 nights
2014-11-18 23:10:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean, I think money has more to do with that
2014-11-18 23:10:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but doubtful
2014-11-18 23:12:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so you're envy of that much money is also telling?
2014-11-18 23:12:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably?
2014-11-18 23:12:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think most people would like having that much money
2014-11-18 23:12:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least most people from working class
2014-11-18 23:12:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]people who have had to deal with money issues
2014-11-18 23:14:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but you also kinda want it so you can live that lavish, hedonistic lifestyle
2014-11-18 23:14:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]which is cool
2014-11-18 23:14:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is that different from anyone else?
2014-11-18 23:14:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that want money for pleasure
2014-11-18 23:15:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the source of pleasure might be different
2014-11-18 23:15:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's all the same motivation
2014-11-18 23:15:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we just established that money and coke can make people assholes, and those are the things you want
2014-11-18 23:15:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's all I'm pointing out
2014-11-18 23:15:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't figure out how this study determines that coke users are worse in social situations because of coke
2014-11-18 23:15:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's interesting
2014-11-18 23:16:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and not that people who are inclined to use coke are more likely to be bad in social situatins
2014-11-18 23:16:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if coke makes people assholes
2014-11-18 23:16:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really think money does either
2014-11-18 23:16:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think money allows people to be assholes
2014-11-18 23:16:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or more be their true selves
2014-11-18 23:16:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I think assholes are probably attracted to coke
2014-11-18 23:17:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think there's probably some connection between people who like amped up situations
2014-11-18 23:17:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](e.g., football players)
2014-11-18 23:17:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](gamblers, which my dad really enjoys)
2014-11-18 23:17:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and people who enjoy cocaine
2014-11-18 23:17:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least that's the impression I get
2014-11-18 23:17:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I think there's a correlation between those types of people with assholes
2014-11-18 23:18:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably has something to do with heightened levels of testosterone or some shit
2014-11-18 23:18:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"True selves" is a loaded word
2014-11-18 23:18:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]obviously
2014-11-18 23:18:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's no such thing as a self
2014-11-18 23:18:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]then who's to say that person is "truer" when they have money
2014-11-18 23:18:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the way their brain is more likely to operate when there aren't external forces like money pressuring them to behave a certain way
2014-11-18 23:19:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]money pressures them to behave a different certain way, for the most part
2014-11-18 23:19:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]there are all kinds of social pressures for rich people that seem trivial only because we aren't from that world
2014-11-18 23:20:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe for old money
2014-11-18 23:20:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I doubt Belfort was responding to those much
2014-11-18 23:21:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]he was responding to social pressure to do drugs and cheat on his wife
2014-11-18 23:21:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]uhh pretty sure he wanted to do those things
2014-11-18 23:21:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and money allowed him to
2014-11-18 23:21:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least that's the way I read it
2014-11-18 23:21:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]is the goal here to be "happier" by being truer to your natural brain's desires?
2014-11-18 23:22:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]who's goal?
2014-11-18 23:22:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why is this preferabe: "the way their brain is more likely to operate when there aren't external forces like money pressuring them to behave a certain way"
2014-11-18 23:23:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's preferable if it makes the person happier
2014-11-18 23:23:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]preferable for that individual at least
2014-11-18 23:25:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]more people do hallucinogens than cocaine
2014-11-18 23:25:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]in the US
2014-11-18 23:26:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and more 18-25 year olds have done molly than coke
2014-11-18 23:26:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-11-18 23:26:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]http://www.drugabuse.gov/national-survey-drug-use-health
2014-11-18 23:26:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]look at the comparison between 18-25 yr olds who have done MDMA and 26+
2014-11-18 23:27:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty trendy right now
2014-11-18 23:27:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and cocaine is at 16.5% for the 26+ group
2014-11-18 23:28:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and 1.2 % for the last year
2014-11-18 23:28:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP].50 in the last month
2014-11-18 23:29:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1 in 200
2014-11-18 23:29:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that makes sense I guess
2014-11-18 23:29:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if it really is a rich person drug
2014-11-18 23:29:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]meth is only .4
2014-11-18 23:29:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*.2
2014-11-18 23:30:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]West Virginia's not a big state
2014-11-18 23:30:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-18 23:30:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]lol
2014-11-18 23:32:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that paper isn't saying cocaine use is causal of the blunted social response
2014-11-18 23:33:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah it doesn't
2014-11-18 23:33:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that building social reward should be used in treatment

2014-11-18 23:44:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All boils down to the fact that life just ain't that great sober.

2014-11-19 10:06:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think so, at some catered thing.
2014-11-19 10:06:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They are pretty good.
2014-11-19 10:06:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's all about the bread
2014-11-19 10:06:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well, that's not true 
2014-11-19 10:06:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-19 10:07:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the bread's a big part, though
2014-11-19 10:11:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate wearing hats 
2014-11-19 10:11:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I didn't like it either when I had long hair
2014-11-19 10:11:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]makes it look goofy
2014-11-19 10:19:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't like it because it makes my head feel itchy
2014-11-19 10:20:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh haha
2014-11-19 10:20:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would like flatten out parts of my hair
2014-11-19 10:20:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and so some of it would be poofy and curly
2014-11-19 10:20:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and other parts would be flat
2014-11-19 10:21:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I have to fluff it at the top to avoid hat hair 
2014-11-19 13:08:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What a useless talk on the DoD fellowship
2014-11-19 13:08:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She just read the eligibility info from the website 
2014-11-19 13:08:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Didn't even talk about the essay
2014-11-19 13:09:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's lame. I don't really expect much out of most info sessions. Did you get lunch at least?
2014-11-19 13:09:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, pizza Capri 
2014-11-19 13:09:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Meh

2014-11-19 13:10:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]disappointment all around it sounds like
2014-11-19 13:10:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was short at least

2014-11-19 13:24:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you have an equivalent to "ass man" or "tits man" for yourself?
2014-11-19 13:24:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Penis man?
2014-11-19 13:25:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha jk
2014-11-19 13:25:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like nice smiles and eyes 
2014-11-19 13:25:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or I should say genuine smiles 
2014-11-19 13:26:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah? That's pretty simple I guess.
2014-11-19 13:26:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And it doesn't really rule out a significant portion of the population right away.
2014-11-19 13:26:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]At least I don't think it does?
2014-11-19 13:26:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good hair
2014-11-19 13:27:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's good hair to you?

2014-11-19 16:32:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I have 10 
2014-11-19 16:33:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I could bullshit a little though 
2014-11-19 16:33:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're the worst
2014-11-19 16:33:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😉
2014-11-19 16:33:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Something you enjoy that's not science.
2014-11-19 16:34:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Food?
2014-11-19 16:36:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kinda want to do like a real concept though 
2014-11-19 16:36:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like try to actually teach something 
2014-11-19 16:36:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe some sort of music theory?
2014-11-19 16:37:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]natural language processing?    😉 
2014-11-19 16:37:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm music 
2014-11-19 16:37:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like that 
2014-11-19 16:37:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can have musical examples! Teach the difference btwn 2 styles 
2014-11-19 16:38:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there you go
2014-11-19 16:38:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'd like working here -->  https://civisanalytics.com/
2014-11-19 16:38:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're the best 
2014-11-19 16:38:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hopefully they're still hiring when I'm applying
2014-11-19 16:39:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're in Chicago?
2014-11-19 16:39:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-19 16:39:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're hiring a bunch of data scientists right now
2014-11-19 16:39:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well why don't you put an app in 
2014-11-19 16:40:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like it's too early
2014-11-19 16:40:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless they say "must be able to start on x date 
2014-11-19 16:41:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it doesn't
2014-11-19 16:41:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll apply after this semester is up so I can put my NLP and DL projects on my GitHub
2014-11-19 16:41:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wouldn't hurt for them to fall in love with you and then you say, I can't start until May 
2014-11-19 16:46:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That makes sense 
2014-11-19 16:56:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The unstructured data one is so perfect for you!
2014-11-19 16:56:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I'm saying
2014-11-19 17:03:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You have to make a bomb cover letter
2014-11-19 17:04:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-11-19 17:04:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well they explicitly request your GitHub profile and they allow you to attach supplementary materials
2014-11-19 17:04:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I should be able to give them a good representation of what I'm capable of
2014-11-19 17:09:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have no idea how that all works 
2014-11-19 17:09:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess you need to stand out enough that they take the time to look at your github?
2014-11-19 17:11:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I suppose so. They don't even require a cover letter, though.
2014-11-19 17:11:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]They just have a text box at the end for additional comments
2014-11-19 17:11:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they say you can put a cover letter there
2014-11-19 17:11:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it sounds like they're emphasizing what you've done
2014-11-19 17:11:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But those comments are what can set you apart!
2014-11-19 17:11:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe
2014-11-19 17:11:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I don't know 
2014-11-19 17:12:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're recruiting at Carnegie Mellon, so I probably have the odds stacked against me
2014-11-19 17:13:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How'd you hear about them?
2014-11-19 17:13:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just looking for data scientist jobs in Chicago

2014-11-19 18:52:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think "ugh" brings my NLP sentiment score down?
2014-11-19 18:53:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let me check
2014-11-19 18:57:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah it's pretty negative

2014-11-19 18:59:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hmm
2014-11-19 18:59:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I use it negatively that often 
2014-11-19 18:59:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's too funny if a word 
2014-11-19 19:00:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah probably people tweeting things like "I feel like poop :("
2014-11-19 19:00:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's about 3x more negative
2014-11-19 19:00:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]More negative than what?
2014-11-19 19:01:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]than positive
2014-11-19 19:01:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]p(poop | negative) / p(poop | positive)
2014-11-19 19:01:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]~3
2014-11-19 19:01:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got it 
2014-11-19 19:01:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My period is starting 
2014-11-19 19:01:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Speaking of negative 
2014-11-19 19:02:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-19 19:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was actually wondering if it was gonna happen next week
2014-11-19 19:02:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nope, it's been 4 weeks since the Halloween party though
2014-11-19 19:03:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like 3.5
2014-11-19 19:03:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It started on wed before the party
2014-11-19 19:04:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]true
2014-11-19 19:05:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]miss you
2014-11-19 19:05:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ooo boy I miss you too
2014-11-19 19:47:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Babeeee
2014-11-19 19:47:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm bored 
2014-11-19 19:47:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-19 19:47:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry
2014-11-19 19:47:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought you had plans for the evening?
2014-11-19 19:47:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going over to Simons at 9
2014-11-19 19:48:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh, alright.
2014-11-19 19:48:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to eat ice cream, cause it's not as tasty without you 
2014-11-19 19:48:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't want to watch Netflix because it's not as enjoyable without your lap to sit on 
2014-11-19 19:49:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd rather play your phone games than mine 
2014-11-19 19:49:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-11-19 19:49:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're such a goofball
2014-11-19 19:49:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You need to come back 
2014-11-19 19:49:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]an adorable, lovable goofball
2014-11-19 19:52:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking today how much I like holding you from behind and you holding my hand
2014-11-19 19:52:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When we snuggle?
2014-11-19 19:53:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-19 19:53:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like that too
2014-11-19 19:53:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like that you don't get cranky with me when I sometimes move around a lot before I go to sleep 
2014-11-19 19:54:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or at least you don't show it 
2014-11-19 19:54:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't even notice
2014-11-19 19:54:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm probably not even awake when you're moving around
2014-11-19 19:54:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-19 19:55:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well like the other night when I went to make tea because I was restless 
2014-11-19 19:55:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You just let me adjust and then continue to cuddle 
2014-11-19 19:55:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's awesome 
2014-11-19 19:55:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well I like cuddling with you!
2014-11-19 20:00:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You are the perfect sleeping companion for me
2014-11-19 20:00:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or I guess perfect companion in general 
2014-11-19 20:00:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-11-19 20:00:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking that to myself today!
2014-11-19 20:01:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How you're perfect for me? Haha
2014-11-19 20:01:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep
2014-11-19 20:01:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was like, "Damn, that girl's lucky"
2014-11-19 20:01:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-11-19 20:02:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I was more thinking about how you handled my IMAX episode
2014-11-19 20:02:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd hardly call that an episode 
2014-11-19 20:02:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess not
2014-11-19 20:03:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'm glad you liked how I handled it 
2014-11-19 20:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah you were just really sympathetic and understanding, but you didn't baby me and make me feel like a wimp at the same time
2014-11-19 20:04:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You aren't a wimp 
2014-11-19 20:05:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That happens to lots of people 
2014-11-19 20:05:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I love you 
2014-11-19 20:06:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm a lucky dude
2014-11-19 20:07:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah mwah mwah
2014-11-19 20:08:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-11-20 00:14:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My love 
2014-11-20 00:14:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes, sugar?
2014-11-20 00:14:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We will one day live in a house where fresh chocolate cookies are always available 
2014-11-20 00:14:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I promise you that 
2014-11-20 00:14:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha we should probably just get married right now
2014-11-20 00:15:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or like five months ago
2014-11-20 00:15:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why do you say that?
2014-11-20 00:15:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because we're perfect for each other
2014-11-20 00:19:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well duh
2014-11-20 00:20:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unfortunately that wouldn't bring us any closer to permanent cohabitation 
2014-11-20 00:20:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're right about that
2014-11-20 00:21:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]5.5 days! 
2014-11-20 00:21:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight, I love you so much.
2014-11-20 00:22:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too. You're seriously the most amazing person and partner. I can't get over how lucky I am.
2014-11-20 00:24:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ditto on all of those accounts. I seriously can't wrap my head around how happy you make me feel.
2014-11-20 00:25:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#symbiosis
2014-11-20 00:26:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]#mutualism
2014-11-20 00:27:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#IDroppedOutOK
2014-11-20 09:05:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't get out of bed 
2014-11-20 09:05:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tooooooo cold
2014-11-20 09:05:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had a pretty hard time this morning too.
2014-11-20 09:06:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Guess I gotta take the covers with me
2014-11-20 09:06:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha I can definitely see you doing that
2014-11-20 09:07:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm actually surprised you don't have a big long robe
2014-11-20 09:07:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or a snuggie
2014-11-20 09:12:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a snuggie in college 
2014-11-20 09:12:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not sure where it went though
2014-11-20 09:13:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I had a big long robe too
2014-11-20 09:13:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might be at home actually 
2014-11-20 09:14:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My dad got it for Christmas one year but I liked it so much I got to keep it 
2014-11-20 09:14:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice. Yeah, they seem like something you'd enjoy.
2014-11-20 09:15:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I like warm soft things?
2014-11-20 09:15:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-20 09:16:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Who doesn't?!
2014-11-20 09:16:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just surprised you went through a whole winter without trying to find one.
2014-11-20 09:17:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think my apt was warmer than this one 
2014-11-20 09:17:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe because it was a lot smaller 
2014-11-20 09:17:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But still with 4 radiators
2014-11-20 09:19:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah. I guess I remember you having the window partially open in the bathroom.
2014-11-20 09:19:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So it couldn't have been that cold.
2014-11-20 09:19:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Even then. You definitely seem like the type of person to wear a long robe.
2014-11-20 09:20:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well maybe one day someone will get me a long fluffy robe of my own 
2014-11-20 09:21:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-11-20 09:21:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😉😉😉😉😉
2014-11-20 09:22:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I need to buy Benadryl 
2014-11-20 09:22:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]booo
2014-11-20 09:22:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying so hard not to scratch right now 
2014-11-20 09:23:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man    😞 
2014-11-20 09:23:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that doesn't sound fun
2014-11-20 09:24:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Come take care of meeee
2014-11-20 09:24:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw... I wish I could!
2014-11-20 09:35:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think this past trip was the first time you didn't give me a blowjob to completion.
2014-11-20 09:36:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was going to on the last night, but then you pulled me up to have sex
2014-11-20 09:37:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah, I was pretty close when I pulled you up, but I wanted to cum in yo pussy
2014-11-20 09:39:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-11-20 09:40:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well also every other time I gave you a blow job you turned it into a 69 situation 
2014-11-20 09:40:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm not mad or anything!
2014-11-20 09:40:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like eating your pussy OK?
2014-11-20 09:40:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Okkkkk
2014-11-20 09:41:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I probably should've let you finish one of them
2014-11-20 09:41:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why?
2014-11-20 09:41:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I really like it when you make me cum like that    😃 
2014-11-20 09:41:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I want one nowwww
2014-11-20 09:41:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well maybe not right now
2014-11-20 09:41:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-11-20 09:41:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but if you felt better    😃 
2014-11-20 09:42:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It would give me something to take my mind off of feeling blegh 
2014-11-20 09:42:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I'd be glad to help
2014-11-20 09:42:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're so noble 
2014-11-20 09:43:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A kitty cat is sleeping on my butt
2014-11-20 09:43:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So now I really can't get out of bed
2014-11-20 09:43:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha of course
2014-11-20 09:44:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She must be so cold!
2014-11-20 09:44:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Poor baby wants snugs and warmth too
2014-11-20 09:47:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm glad we get to spend our first holiday season together physically together
2014-11-20 09:47:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we even get Thanksgiving
2014-11-20 09:57:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too
2014-11-20 09:57:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So much happiness ahead!
2014-11-20 09:58:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yay!
2014-11-20 10:03:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And foooood
2014-11-20 10:03:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh, man. I have a feeling I'm gonna see a whole new level of you.
2014-11-20 10:03:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I actually don't love thanksgiving food
2014-11-20 10:04:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except dessert
2014-11-20 10:04:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah?
2014-11-20 10:04:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm a pretty big fan.
2014-11-20 10:04:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Turkey is good, bread is good, stuffing is ok
2014-11-20 10:05:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I don't like green bean casserole 
2014-11-20 10:05:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And barely like sweet potatoes 
2014-11-20 10:05:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha word
2014-11-20 10:06:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like green bean casserole a lot
2014-11-20 10:06:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll
2014-11-20 10:06:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*ick
2014-11-20 10:30:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you see the stoned grandma video?
2014-11-20 10:31:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, any other thanksgiving food faves?
2014-11-20 10:55:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm watching it now.
2014-11-20 10:58:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not really your typical suburban grandmas
2014-11-20 10:58:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least not the ones I know
2014-11-20 10:58:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess they live in Washington, though.
2014-11-20 10:59:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-11-20 10:59:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You gotta wonder though if grandmas do talk about sex like that to themselves 
2014-11-20 10:59:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bet they do 
2014-11-20 10:59:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe some
2014-11-20 10:59:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]most grandmas I know are religious
2014-11-20 11:00:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Religious people still like sex with their husbands 
2014-11-20 11:00:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Catholics don't talk about sex
2014-11-20 11:00:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess that's true 
2014-11-20 11:01:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haleys parents had sex during s church retreat because her mom was ovulating. The head preacher let them use his private room lol 
2014-11-20 11:01:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Go forth and multiply"
2014-11-20 11:02:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's not really that surprising, though, is it?
2014-11-20 11:02:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they had probably discussed wanting to have children with the preacher
2014-11-20 11:02:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sex is about making babies in that case
2014-11-20 14:21:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The dude who got second place told me I should make an app too haha.
2014-11-20 14:34:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just saw a guy lift his shirt and look at his abs in the gym.
2014-11-20 14:37:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Gotta check on the progress 
2014-11-20 15:18:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]One of those days where Texas doesn't suck so bad.
2014-11-20 15:19:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Booooooo
2014-11-20 19:07:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to tonight?
2014-11-20 19:09:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not much. What about you?
2014-11-20 19:13:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nothing
2014-11-20 19:13:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Debating wether to find something to do or just stay in 
2014-11-20 19:14:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I finished a grant today, so I think I'm done working for the night 
2014-11-20 19:14:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. Do you have any options or were you just gonna get in contact with people?
2014-11-20 19:16:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Get in touch
2014-11-20 19:17:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't really love organizing things though
2014-11-20 19:19:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Doesn't have to be elaborate.
2014-11-20 19:19:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That might be a different between you and me
2014-11-20 19:20:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-11-20 19:20:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's not something that bothers you 
2014-11-20 19:21:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or you don't mind doing it I guess 
2014-11-20 19:21:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I just don't think there's much to it.
2014-11-20 19:21:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Invite a few people over.

2014-11-21 19:25:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Didn't you tell me they were having issues a while ago 
2014-11-21 19:25:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like when we started dating?
2014-11-21 19:25:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, he wasn't sure if they should move in to gether
2014-11-21 19:25:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and there was some weird pseudo-cheating stuff happening
2014-11-21 19:26:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the boundaries weren't ever entirely clear to me
2014-11-21 19:27:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe they weren't clear to her?
2014-11-21 19:27:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like she didn't want any boundaries
2014-11-21 19:28:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or at least that's how she acted
2014-11-21 19:30:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you going to try to hang out with him before Tuesday?
2014-11-21 19:30:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably not
2014-11-21 19:31:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I talk to him some today on Facebook
2014-11-21 19:31:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he's got a bunch of friends taking care of him
2014-11-21 19:32:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's good 
2014-11-21 19:33:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My phone has been at 3% for 20 minutes 
2014-11-21 19:33:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Insane!
2014-11-21 19:33:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha beast mode
2014-11-21 19:33:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's hard for me even to imagine you cheating on me
2014-11-21 19:37:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In what way?
2014-11-21 19:38:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would just seem so out of nowhere
2014-11-21 19:41:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I don't anticipate myself doing It, so that makes sense 
2014-11-21 19:42:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I guess I probably wouldn't break up with you
2014-11-21 19:44:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's good?
2014-11-21 19:45:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I obviously wouldn't break up with you either 
2014-11-21 19:45:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like we'd be able to get past something like that 
2014-11-21 19:46:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought I wasn't able to cheat on you!
2014-11-21 19:46:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess emotionally I can.
2014-11-21 20:10:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-11-21 20:10:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought I always said I didn't care if you hooked up with someone else 
2014-11-21 20:10:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's what I'm saying
2014-11-21 20:11:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not able to cheat on you
2014-11-21 20:11:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I have permission
2014-11-21 20:11:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I see
2014-11-21 20:11:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I gave you permission too
2014-11-21 20:11:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so we can't cheat on each other
2014-11-21 20:11:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yay!
2014-11-21 20:11:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-11-21 20:12:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you
2014-11-21 20:12:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how much?
2014-11-21 20:13:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there's like no pseudocode in this chapter
2014-11-21 20:13:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll be pretty impressed if you can get through it without help
2014-11-21 20:14:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I have to figure out the algorithm it wants by myself?
2014-11-21 20:14:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they have like full text descriptions
2014-11-21 20:14:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]of what the algorithm is doing
2014-11-21 20:15:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you have to basically interpret that into an algorithm
2014-11-21 20:23:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]doing that Dave Matthews song was actually pretty fun the other night
2014-11-21 20:23:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hadn't even thought of that song in a long time
2014-11-21 20:23:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which one?
2014-11-21 20:23:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Crash Into Me"
2014-11-21 20:24:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I miss you times a million 
2014-11-21 20:24:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah I liked that song too
2014-11-21 20:27:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like that there's probably a pretty strong divide in fans of that band between people my age and your age
2014-11-21 20:27:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't really like them as a rule 
2014-11-21 20:27:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I do like some of their songs 
2014-11-21 20:27:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha what do you mean?
2014-11-21 21:03:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't like DMB
2014-11-21 21:03:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Generally speaking 
2014-11-21 21:04:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I do like some of their songs 
2014-11-21 21:04:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-11-21 21:04:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I guess I'm the same way
2014-11-21 21:04:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was kinda anti-DMB a bit in high school
2014-11-21 21:04:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because so many people were convinced they were the greatest band ever
2014-11-21 21:04:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or enough people were convinced
2014-11-21 21:05:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I haven't honestly thought of the band in years, though
2014-11-21 21:05:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had completely forgot that song existed
2014-11-21 21:08:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My generation definitely doesn't have that same fervor 
2014-11-21 21:09:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But some people do 
2014-11-21 21:09:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And they headlined Bonnaroo the 1st year I went 
2014-11-21 21:09:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I listened to them more before and was not that impressed
2014-11-21 21:17:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you!
2014-11-21 21:17:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ohhhhhh yeah
2014-11-21 21:20:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]?
2014-11-21 21:20:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I thought you might've been doing the Kool-Aid man thing
2014-11-21 21:20:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I realized it wasn't giving the right inflection 
2014-11-21 21:21:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but of course
2014-11-21 21:21:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a crazy amount
2014-11-21 21:21:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish we weren't apart so much because I love being around you
2014-11-21 21:33:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're the best 
2014-11-21 21:33:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you doing right now?
2014-11-21 21:33:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]still working on bioinformatics
2014-11-21 21:33:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]only two more problems
2014-11-21 21:33:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]more like 1.1
2014-11-21 21:33:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm almost done with this one
2014-11-21 21:38:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]mmmk well I'll let you finih
2014-11-21 21:38:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*finish
2014-11-21 21:38:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm home for good
2014-11-21 21:38:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so call me when you're done? I want to see your handsome face
2014-11-21 21:39:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good    😃 
2014-11-21 22:36:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-11-21 22:36:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]done with all the programming
2014-11-21 22:37:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just have the quizzes
2014-11-21 22:37:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but those can probably wait
2014-11-21 22:37:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you got those late days
2014-11-21 22:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah and they aren't due yet
2014-11-21 22:38:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]quiz 3 is due December 1st
2014-11-21 22:38:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and quiz 4 is due December 15th
2014-11-21 22:38:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and they don't take long
2014-11-21 22:38:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I'll do them tomorrow
2014-11-21 22:38:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]truth
2014-11-21 22:39:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sooooo

2014-11-21 23:46:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Shit is freaking out.
2014-11-21 23:46:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Booo
2014-11-21 23:47:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm one second away from passing out though 
2014-11-21 23:47:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So goodnight!
2014-11-21 23:47:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love how you make me laugh 
2014-11-21 23:47:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK, goodnight.
2014-11-21 23:48:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]10) I love how you break the tension.

2014-11-21 23:49:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha
2014-11-21 23:49:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘😘😘😘😘
2014-11-21 23:49:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cant wait to wake up and be that much closer to being in your arms 
2014-11-21 23:50:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Awww
2014-11-21 23:50:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much.
2014-11-22 08:44:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a Benadryl hangover 
2014-11-22 09:51:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Really? What does they feel like?
2014-11-22 10:04:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.facebook.com/video.php?v=10102343479669960&set=vb.20927122&type=2&theater
2014-11-22 10:34:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]honeyyyy
2014-11-22 10:34:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]come suck my dick
2014-11-22 10:34:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then cuddle with me
2014-11-22 10:41:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a splitting headache and bloodshot eyes
2014-11-22 10:41:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I feel a little better now
2014-11-22 10:41:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone's been craving the blow jobs lately lol
2014-11-22 10:41:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😞 
2014-11-22 10:41:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I always want blow jobs!
2014-11-22 10:44:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha 
2014-11-22 10:44:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One day you'll be in excess of blow jobs honey
2014-11-22 10:44:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-11-22 10:45:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The code you sent me doesn't work 
2014-11-22 10:45:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I can't figure out why
2014-11-22 10:46:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have to have the file in the same directory as where you're running the program from
2014-11-22 10:46:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or
2014-11-22 10:46:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you testing it on?
2014-11-22 10:46:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did that
2014-11-22 10:46:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you testing it on the "Extra dataset"
2014-11-22 10:46:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It reads the file just fine
2014-11-22 10:46:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a spectrumDict
2014-11-22 10:47:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]CycloPeptideSeqiencing returns an empty list
2014-11-22 10:49:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wait now it's running, but taking forever
2014-11-22 10:49:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're using exactly my code?
2014-11-22 10:49:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am now
2014-11-22 10:49:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mine runs in < 1 sec
2014-11-22 10:50:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]on the dataset you get graded on
2014-11-22 10:50:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except I changed getLonearSpectrum because it was returning a non defined variable 
2014-11-22 10:50:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really know why it wouldn't work on your computer
2014-11-22 10:51:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok I got it 
2014-11-22 10:51:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe Python was just being glitchy
2014-11-22 10:52:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah maybe, it's usually a good idea to start a new session before you run code
2014-11-22 10:52:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in case you have global variables defined or something
2014-11-22 10:52:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in the Python console that is
2014-11-22 10:53:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or interpreter I should say
2014-11-22 10:53:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm trying out Canopy
2014-11-22 10:53:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It feels a little more like RStudio
2014-11-22 10:53:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]never heard of it
2014-11-22 10:53:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah?
2014-11-22 10:54:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah, definitely looks inspired by it
2014-11-22 10:54:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-11-22 10:54:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To get a bunch of packages "preloaded with documentation and tutorials" you have to pay though 
2014-11-22 10:55:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you can still import them for free
2014-11-22 10:55:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what does that include?
2014-11-22 10:55:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are they just tutorials on Python?
2014-11-22 10:55:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or is it like example analyses?
2014-11-22 10:55:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like bio python 
2014-11-22 10:55:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh O
2014-11-22 10:55:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]K
2014-11-22 10:56:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Scientific packages mostly and tutorials to use them 
2014-11-22 10:56:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word

2014-11-23 11:00:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-23 11:00:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha no, I don't think so. I think it's cause I looked at that pic longingly before I went to sleep
2014-11-23 11:01:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-11-23 11:01:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll be playing with your tits soon

2014-11-23 11:02:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll find a way, don't worry
2014-11-23 11:03:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Might need to get a gag or something to keep me quiet

2014-11-23 11:12:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like the desire to touch you and myself would drive me crazy 
2014-11-23 11:12:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In a good way
2014-11-23 11:13:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it would be super sexy
2014-11-23 11:13:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]could do a lot of teasing
2014-11-23 11:14:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd only ungag you to put my dick in your mouth
2014-11-23 11:15:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Rub it on my titties 
2014-11-23 11:15:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely
2014-11-23 11:16:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]titty fucking you actually works pretty well, in my opinion
2014-11-23 11:16:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really?
2014-11-23 11:16:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I like it
2014-11-23 11:16:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's hard to tell home much you get out of it 
2014-11-23 11:16:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like it a lot
2014-11-23 11:16:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it seems like you like it
2014-11-23 11:16:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is sexy
2014-11-23 11:16:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd definitely like to finish that way sometime
2014-11-23 11:17:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would be pretty fucking proud if we did that 
2014-11-23 11:17:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha really?
2014-11-23 11:18:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made you cum with my tits
2014-11-23 11:18:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's definitely a sexual feat for a woman 
2014-11-23 11:18:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha, yeah I guess it is!
2014-11-23 11:18:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And would make me feel super sexy haha
2014-11-23 11:19:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well we should definitely do it then
2014-11-23 11:19:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually don't know the last time I did that
2014-11-23 11:20:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hannah's tits weren't big enough
2014-11-23 11:21:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and there wasn't a lot of external cumming going on with Autumn
2014-11-23 11:21:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it'd be a treat for me too    😃 
2014-11-23 11:22:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'd hope it would be enjoyable regardless lol
2014-11-23 11:22:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well obviously
2014-11-23 11:23:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we're so sexually compatible
2014-11-23 11:23:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's hard for me to imagine you not being sexually compatible with a guy
2014-11-23 11:23:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](from his perspective)
2014-11-23 11:23:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're so sexy
2014-11-23 11:23:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I was about to say, it's pretty easy for me to imagine not being sexually compatible with a guy 
2014-11-23 11:24:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you genuinely love doing stuff that I find really sexy
2014-11-23 11:24:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I've gotten pretty high praise from most people I've slept with in college 
2014-11-23 11:24:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or after
2014-11-23 11:25:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah?
2014-11-23 11:25:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The words "best sex I've ever had" may have been used by multiple people
2014-11-23 11:25:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which is cool, except when I didn't have an orgasm 
2014-11-23 11:26:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And am left sexually frustrated lol
2014-11-23 11:26:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no shit
2014-11-23 11:26:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so how many dudes you've slept with are you the best they've had
2014-11-23 11:26:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-11-23 11:26:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But guys probably say that to girls all the time 
2014-11-23 11:27:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]5 have said that 
2014-11-23 11:27:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]6
2014-11-23 11:27:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Though that probably could've changed 
2014-11-23 11:27:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. That's a pretty solid record.
2014-11-23 11:28:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But only one of them is the best sex I've ever had ;)
2014-11-23 11:31:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pretty weird!
2014-11-23 11:31:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you wouldn't think there's that much of a difference.
2014-11-23 11:31:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe there's not.
2014-11-23 11:32:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we've talked about how you might just be more comfortable with sex and stuff.
2014-11-23 11:32:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That much of a difference between women?
2014-11-23 11:32:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]men
2014-11-23 11:32:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No way
2014-11-23 11:33:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There are huge differences 
2014-11-23 11:33:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't really understand how there can be that big of a different between women 
2014-11-23 11:33:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean... there probably shouldn't be.
2014-11-23 11:34:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But a lot of women probably aren't as enthusiastic and comfortable with themselves as you are.
2014-11-23 11:35:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My pleasure is affected by size, by the movements a guy makes, the positions he prefers, and his attitude towards me. I feel like a guys orgasm aren't dependent on those
2014-11-23 11:35:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like the first time we had sex was not the best sex I've ever had
2014-11-23 11:35:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are the movements really that different?
2014-11-23 11:37:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some guys can only cum at a very particular tempo which may be ok sometimes, but as you know I like variety 
2014-11-23 11:37:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And so always finishing the same way is boring and not stimulating 
2014-11-23 11:38:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like in the same position?
2014-11-23 11:38:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-11-23 11:39:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also like the way a guy touches me makes a big difference 
2014-11-23 11:39:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A surprising number of dudes I've slept with are really bad at finger stimulation
2014-11-23 11:40:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like, I don't know if they really know where the clit is 
2014-11-23 11:40:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's interesting
2014-11-23 11:41:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's something you probably wouldn't learn without having a girlfriend
2014-11-23 11:41:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and some clear feedback
2014-11-23 11:41:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They had serious girlfriends before me 
2014-11-23 11:41:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's the feedback thing 
2014-11-23 11:42:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some women who haven't ever had an orgasm or played with themselves a little might not know how to direct a guy I think 
2014-11-23 11:42:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-23 11:42:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well did you direct these guys?
2014-11-23 11:42:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seems like that'd be easy to fix
2014-11-23 11:43:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd move their hands up or down I guess 
2014-11-23 11:43:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But didn't do an awkward show and tell lol
2014-11-23 11:44:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well I mean you could've like said something
2014-11-23 11:44:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess maybe I showed cam, but then he still couldn't make me cum very often so I just gave up trying 
2014-11-23 11:44:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cum in general?
2014-11-23 11:45:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-11-23 11:45:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you just didn't get off?
2014-11-23 11:45:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've told you that though 
2014-11-23 11:45:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think you have.
2014-11-23 11:46:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've told you that cumming during sex has been relatively rare in my previous relationships 
2014-11-23 11:46:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah, I guess so.
2014-11-23 11:47:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm so curious about why that is
2014-11-23 11:47:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He had a kinda small penis and sweated a lot?
2014-11-23 11:47:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I dunno
2014-11-23 11:47:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so other relationships were better?
2014-11-23 11:48:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you masturbate a lot?
2014-11-23 11:48:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like 3 times a week sometimes 
2014-11-23 11:48:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With my removeable shower head
2014-11-23 11:48:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've definitely told you this before 
2014-11-23 11:48:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]3 times was the average?
2014-11-23 11:49:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe 2x was the average, I don't really remember 
2014-11-23 11:49:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm surprised you would stay in a relationship that long
2014-11-23 11:50:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that wasn't sexually satisfying?
2014-11-23 11:50:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or was it?
2014-11-23 11:50:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you just didn't have orgasms?
2014-11-23 11:51:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've told you, we were comfortable around each other and I enjoyed his company and he treated me really well, there just wasn't a lot of passion 
2014-11-23 11:51:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We like never fought either, which could be a little boring in a way too
2014-11-23 11:52:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not really feeling another sexual history talk right now though lol
2014-11-23 11:52:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Need some breakfast first 
2014-11-23 11:53:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm more curious about your sexual future
2014-11-23 11:53:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or hypothetical sexual future
2014-11-23 11:54:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe most dudes would give you multiple orgasms at this point?
2014-11-23 11:56:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know you think I just have multiple orgasms because I've figured out how to help myself get there with you 
2014-11-23 11:57:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But that's definitely not the whole picture 
2014-11-23 11:57:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure a lot of it has to do with how connected I feel to you at other levels 
2014-11-23 11:57:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I don't think I share that connection with most guys 
2014-11-23 11:58:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure that elevates it, but even early on you were all about sex with me.
2014-11-23 11:58:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Unless you're saying that "connection" was there then?
2014-11-23 12:00:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought we hit it off really early, isn't that one of the crazy characteristics of our relationship?
2014-11-23 12:00:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm saying
2014-11-23 12:00:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you wanted to fuck me
2014-11-23 12:01:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we had sex
2014-11-23 12:01:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was good
2014-11-23 12:01:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so imagine this new scenario
2014-11-23 12:01:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where there is a guy in the room
2014-11-23 12:01:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whom you don't know particularly well
2014-11-23 12:01:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you are attracted to
2014-11-23 12:01:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and want to fuck
2014-11-23 12:02:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would that sex be "pretty great" by your previous standards
2014-11-23 12:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and would that level of sex be the norm
2014-11-23 12:02:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]going forward
2014-11-23 12:02:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't have the answer to that question, sorry
2014-11-23 12:03:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we got like 60 years to test it
2014-11-23 12:03:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-23 12:04:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know why you turn my comment about how you're the best sex I've ever had into a discussion about me defending that statement  
2014-11-23 12:04:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not asking you to defend it
2014-11-23 12:04:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then why are you bringing up this hypothetical bs?
2014-11-23 12:05:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're implying I might not know if you're really the best sex out there for me
2014-11-23 12:05:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think that's what I'm implying
2014-11-23 12:06:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm implying I'm not particularly special
2014-11-23 12:06:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're implying our sex isn't 'special@
2014-11-23 12:06:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's special because of all the stuff beyond the purely physical things
2014-11-23 12:06:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We went from "we're so sexually compatible" to this 
2014-11-23 12:07:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'm not really that special for you either 
2014-11-23 12:08:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I'm not the best sex you've ever had? 
2014-11-23 12:08:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I definitely don't give you the best blow jibs
2014-11-23 12:09:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like your demeanor in bed
2014-11-23 12:09:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I've mentioned I think we've got a good height difference
2014-11-23 12:09:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and your blow jobs are great now
2014-11-23 12:11:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that goes back to what I was saying about there really shouldn't be that much of a difference between women
2014-11-23 12:11:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]really enthusiasm is key
2014-11-23 12:11:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and feedbakc
2014-11-23 12:12:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a woman who knows what feels good to her
2014-11-23 12:12:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and is willing to communicate that
2014-11-23 12:12:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and a woman who is willing to do things that feel good to the guy
2014-11-23 12:12:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would say that's all that's really necessary to meet the physical components
2014-11-23 12:12:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]of great sex
2014-11-23 12:12:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the emotional stuff is the hard part I'd say
2014-11-23 12:13:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't be able to look into the eyes of another woman and feel the way I do when I look in your eyes
2014-11-23 12:14:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well since I'm a woman it's hard to separate the emotional and physical when I categorize something as "great sex@
2014-11-23 12:18:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone finished my grape juice -_-
2014-11-23 12:19:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Little do they know how much I drink out of it with my mouth 
2014-11-23 12:19:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha

2014-11-23 13:13:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think so
2014-11-23 13:14:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah

2014-11-23 13:24:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ad we have too many windows for me to just be naked
2014-11-23 13:27:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-23 13:27:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like the tease

2014-11-23 13:28:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like being naked too though
2014-11-23 13:28:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]at least no pants
2014-11-23 13:28:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I've noticed
2014-11-23 13:28:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we should have a no pants rule in our house
2014-11-23 13:29:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh yeah?
2014-11-23 13:29:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you prefer me in what?

2014-11-23 13:34:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hmmm
2014-11-23 13:34:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]seeing you walk around naked is pretty great
2014-11-23 13:34:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sitting on furniture naked is kinda gross
2014-11-23 13:35:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sometimes
2014-11-23 13:35:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-11-23 13:35:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really like it
2014-11-23 13:35:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like if you were just lounging on my couch naked while working that wouldn't turn me on
2014-11-23 13:35:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I do think you look great in boxer breifs
2014-11-23 13:36:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or just your sweats
2014-11-23 13:36:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or nice jeans
2014-11-23 13:36:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]just a shirt, ehhh
2014-11-23 13:36:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I would definitely not feel sexy in just a shirt
2014-11-23 13:38:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but that little tease of your balls
2014-11-23 13:38:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh baby
2014-11-23 13:39:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-11-23 13:44:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is there anything I do that would qualify as a "tease"?
2014-11-23 13:50:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]as far as wearing clothes?
2014-11-23 13:51:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or just in general?
2014-11-23 13:51:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess eiether
2014-11-23 13:51:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ick
2014-11-23 13:51:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]eitehr
2014-11-23 13:51:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ick

2014-11-23 13:51:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]haha
2014-11-23 13:51:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]when you kiss everywhere but my pussy as you go down on me
2014-11-23 13:52:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that one time when I got to Raleigh and you started with a massage and touching me and then going in really shallow and slow
2014-11-23 13:53:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but those teases always end in me getting what I want eventually
2014-11-23 13:53:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha true
2014-11-23 18:09:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]ughhhhhhh
2014-11-23 18:09:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]my LeaderboardCycloSeq program takes 5:10 min every time
2014-11-23 18:09:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've tried everything I can think of to opyomize it
2014-11-23 18:09:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the problem is, I don't know what takes longer than what in python
2014-11-23 18:10:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so I just try to avoid unneccessary iterations
2014-11-23 18:10:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but maybe it's something else thats slowing it down
2014-11-23 18:13:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]https://github.com/ksil91/Bioinformatics/blob/master/leaderboardCycloSeq
2014-11-23 18:17:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I got it!

2014-11-23 18:22:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you're really good at it
2014-11-23 18:25:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it's your Trim function
2014-11-23 18:27:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah?
2014-11-23 18:27:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you build a dictionary and then iterate through all of the old dictionary keys each time
2014-11-23 18:28:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]both of those are slow
2014-11-23 18:28:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah 
2014-11-23 18:28:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should iterate through the type list 
2014-11-23 18:28:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tuple
2014-11-23 18:29:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually don't really know what's going on there
2014-11-23 18:30:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My trim?
2014-11-23 18:30:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-23 18:31:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm about to go get some yusho, but I can look through it later 
2014-11-23 18:32:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not a big deal
2014-11-23 18:32:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it clearly works
2014-11-23 18:39:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want it to be the best!
2014-11-23 22:00:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Heyo
2014-11-23 22:00:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what up
2014-11-23 22:00:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Just had a big 'ol dinner
2014-11-23 22:00:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think that apostrophe is on the wrong side
2014-11-23 22:03:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's short for lol
2014-11-23 22:03:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Big lol dinner
2014-11-23 22:03:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I was actually thinking that
2014-11-23 22:05:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Help remind me to check in tomorrow
2014-11-23 22:05:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]set a reminder
2014-11-23 22:05:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're no fun
2014-11-23 22:05:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-23 22:05:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how was dinner?
2014-11-23 22:06:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good. Got the pig tail ramen and the pumpkin soft serve
2014-11-23 22:06:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They raised the prices even more 
2014-11-23 22:07:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That place appeals to me less as a tasty casual place to eat 
2014-11-23 22:07:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think they're trying to be casual
2014-11-23 22:07:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like a $20 meal
2014-11-23 22:07:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They said in their opening interviews they want it to be a place people can come "everyday"
2014-11-23 22:08:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And the prices used to be a lot cheaper 
2014-11-23 22:08:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Everything is like $2-$4 more 
2014-11-23 22:08:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]their presentation doesn't come across as the kind of place where "everyday" people eat
2014-11-23 22:08:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh that's not what they said
2014-11-23 22:09:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are people in Hyde Park who can probably eat their regularly
2014-11-23 22:09:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I maybe could've before it went up in price 
2014-11-23 22:10:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Anyways, it was pretty tasty 
2014-11-23 22:10:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I went with Dallas, Brett, Shane, and Evan 
2014-11-23 22:18:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to?
2014-11-23 22:19:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]watching the Cowboys and working on my project

2014-11-23 22:21:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I just came home after, they were going to smoke at watch tv which didn't really appeal to me 
2014-11-23 22:21:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might take some Benadryl  and read for a bit before crashing 
2014-11-23 22:21:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm still itchy
2014-11-23 22:22:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]bummer

2014-11-23 23:34:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah he hates interviews/the media

2014-11-23 23:38:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the young doctor from Masters of Sex is Harvey Dent in Gotham

2014-11-23 23:39:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I do like it
2014-11-23 23:39:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah keeping up with shows takes effort.
2014-11-23 23:41:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's easier when you have someone to watch with
2014-11-23 23:53:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well I'm going to crash
2014-11-23 23:54:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK goodnight

2014-11-24 09:55:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes 
2014-11-24 09:55:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Benadryl hangover 
2014-11-24 09:56:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, I'm sorry.
2014-11-24 09:56:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're also very difficult sometimes haha
2014-11-24 09:56:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can just bring my own cereal if it's this big of a deal.
2014-11-24 09:57:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not a big deal at all
2014-11-24 09:57:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She's at the store and is buying cereal 
2014-11-24 10:35:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Did you check in?
2014-11-24 10:40:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yup, B20
2014-11-24 10:40:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]This Elite Daily website is the worst.
2014-11-24 10:41:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Men instinctively want a fun, carefree and active life, free from responsibility. Women are driven toward motherhood and thus, a life of order, rules and responsibility. We are destined to clash based on that logic. And, God forbid we seek sexual comfort from outsiders, should things ever get a little rocky."
2014-11-24 10:42:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]agreed
2014-11-24 10:43:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]where'd you see that?
2014-11-24 10:43:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Dar has been posting all this relationship shit recently
2014-11-24 10:43:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a lot of it is garbage
2014-11-24 10:44:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the title of this one is "One Love? Don't Think So: 4 Gaping Flaws With The Concept Of Monogamy"
2014-11-24 10:45:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The writer graduated in 2013 with a degree in pscyhology
2014-11-24 10:45:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"15 ways we can put an end to the dishonest dating culture we've created"
2014-11-24 10:45:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she's obviously an expert
2014-11-24 10:45:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-11-24 10:45:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he posted that one too
2014-11-24 10:45:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I saw it on his facebook
2014-11-24 10:45:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate shit like that the worst
2014-11-24 10:45:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how chivalvry is dead and it's because of hookup culture
2014-11-24 10:45:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and men who don't want to settle down
2014-11-24 10:46:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]if a dude doesn't want to settle down, that's his business!
2014-11-24 10:46:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I guess that's my main problem with these
2014-11-24 10:46:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is that they generalize too much
2014-11-24 10:46:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]some people like monogamy
2014-11-24 10:46:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]some people don't
2014-11-24 10:47:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a lot of people probably like one or the other more at different points in their lives
2014-11-24 10:47:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]talking to amy and haley about OKCupid, I think sites like those are now maybe the best ways to find someone who's looking for the same thing as you 
2014-11-24 10:47:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]if you're not looking for a casual hookup
2014-11-24 10:48:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or if your soulmate doesn't happen to go to the same conference as you lol
2014-11-24 10:48:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-24 10:48:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I'd trust it
2014-11-24 10:48:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's at least better than random
2014-11-24 10:49:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the pool is deeper than the random people you might encounter in your day-to-day life
2014-11-24 10:49:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]definitely, and it's a bit romantic to think you'll actually bump into someone who's perfect for you at the coffee shop
2014-11-24 10:49:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah, exactly
2014-11-24 10:51:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if there is anything to this "hookup culture" thing
2014-11-24 10:51:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's hard to say
2014-11-24 10:51:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it'd be interesting to study the sexual tendencies of kids raised in a world without media
2014-11-24 10:51:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and ones raised with current American media
2014-11-24 10:51:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it does seem like "hooking up" is glorified
2014-11-24 10:51:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]in the same getting drunk is
2014-11-24 10:52:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or of we had accurate data of sexual tendencies before like 1960
2014-11-24 10:52:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but people were probably less sexually active because of societal pressures back then
2014-11-24 10:53:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like did "cheating" exist in caveman culture
2014-11-24 10:54:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe
2014-11-24 17:06:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Workin workin?
2014-11-24 17:07:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Getting some dinner.
2014-11-24 17:07:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What are you up to?
2014-11-24 17:10:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eating a microwaveable
2014-11-24 17:11:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not quite back home ballin'.
2014-11-24 17:11:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But so sooooon

2014-11-24 17:18:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like you've been particularly excited this gap.
2014-11-24 17:18:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or you've been very vocal about the countdown at least.
2014-11-24 17:18:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I've probably been just as excited as I usually am the 5 days before 
2014-11-24 17:19:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But those 5 days took up most of the break 
2014-11-24 17:20:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That makes sense.
2014-11-24 17:23:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Your momma excited about you visiting?
2014-11-24 17:24:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aww
2014-11-24 17:36:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Isn't it funny how you have go through all these barriers to adopt, but anyone can get pregnant and have a baby?
2014-11-24 17:37:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A little bit 
2014-11-24 17:37:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you can have your kid taken away
2014-11-24 17:37:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It takes a lot, though.
2014-11-24 17:38:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And you need to get your credit approved to buy a house/car or get a credit card.
2014-11-24 17:38:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But bringing a person into the world? Nah, just go for it.
2014-11-24 17:44:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm all for more population control

2014-11-24 19:02:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get paid for four hours on Thursday and Friday.

2014-11-24 19:05:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You got plans or something?
2014-11-24 19:06:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What do you mean?
2014-11-24 19:06:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because you asked how much I need to work.
2014-11-24 19:07:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh like plans without you? 
2014-11-24 19:07:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-11-24 19:07:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was just wondering 
2014-11-24 19:07:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant in general.
2014-11-24 19:10:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Interesting... " We went out to talent agencies. Had to. No grandma we knew and about three degrees separated from us had smoked weed before. Note: these women were not professional actresses. They have different jobs. They're mainly repped for modeling. Paula actually isn't repped at all. Also, we grilled every person they sent us to make sure they had never smoked before. Many women tried to say they hadn't but after some time would admit that they had "about 40 years ago." Well, we wanted people who really had never done it before."
2014-11-24 19:10:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's the director of that video.
2014-11-24 19:13:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Had or hadn't?
2014-11-24 19:13:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In the 2nd sentence
2014-11-24 19:13:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*3rd
2014-11-24 19:14:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually don't know now that you pointed it out.
2014-11-24 19:17:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how old were you the first time you masturbated?
2014-11-24 19:18:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why do you want to know?
2014-11-24 19:18:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha just curious?
2014-11-24 19:19:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you going to compare it to the average age of 1st masturbation in females? 
2014-11-24 19:19:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I could.
2014-11-24 19:19:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hadn't thought of that.
2014-11-24 19:20:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you're not saying?
2014-11-24 19:21:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably around 14
2014-11-24 19:21:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I didn't do it very often at all until I went to college 
2014-11-24 19:22:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess then I didn't do it with any reall frequency until my junior year
2014-11-24 19:22:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]kinda makes sense, though.
2014-11-24 19:22:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you were getting some on the reg most of that time, right?
2014-11-24 19:23:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sure
2014-11-24 19:26:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I also wasn't very good at it until I got my vibrator 
2014-11-24 19:26:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and a vibrator made you better without a vibrator
2014-11-24 19:26:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or a vibrator made it easier?
2014-11-24 19:27:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I had an orgasm from masturbating until I got my vibrator
2014-11-24 19:28:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's interesting
2014-11-24 19:28:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you just did it cuz it felt good?
2014-11-24 19:28:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so your first orgasm was caused by a guy?
2014-11-24 19:28:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-11-24 19:28:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty wild
2014-11-24 19:28:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did it blow your mind
2014-11-24 19:28:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-11-24 19:29:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't really remember but  sure it felt really good
2014-11-24 19:29:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you remember your first orgasm?
2014-11-24 19:29:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah it was the first time I masturbated
2014-11-24 19:30:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if that's common for girls
2014-11-24 19:30:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably
2014-11-24 19:30:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I have a feeling it's very uncommon for guys, haha
2014-11-24 19:31:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm surprised you don't really remember it
2014-11-24 19:31:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it seems like it would be a crazy experience
2014-11-24 19:31:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was it with your high school boyfriend?
2014-11-24 19:31:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-11-24 19:32:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from what?
2014-11-24 19:32:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fingering 
2014-11-24 19:33:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't remember if I gave Kelly her first orgasm or not
2014-11-24 19:33:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the first hand job she gave me was like 5 months in
2014-11-24 19:33:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I guess probably?
2014-11-24 19:33:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she was pretty sheltered
2014-11-24 19:34:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was her first for most things
2014-11-24 19:34:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess everything except kissing
2014-11-24 19:34:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't believe you don't remember! Haha
2014-11-24 19:34:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be like
2014-11-24 19:34:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]taking ecstasy for the first time
2014-11-24 19:34:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and not remembering how it felt
2014-11-24 19:35:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or any drug I guess
2014-11-24 19:35:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like it's a complete surprise when it happens
2014-11-24 19:35:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's an awesome feeling
2014-11-24 19:36:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean I guess I remember when it happened, and we were both pretty psyched about it, I just don't remember exactly how it felt 
2014-11-24 19:36:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't have a great long term memory in that regard 
2014-11-24 19:36:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-11-24 21:29:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm debating whether I want to check a bag
2014-11-24 21:30:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's the debate?
2014-11-24 21:32:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I need to bring conditioner 
2014-11-24 21:32:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you have conditioner?
2014-11-24 21:32:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-24 21:41:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it a shampoo/conditioner combo?
2014-11-24 21:41:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nay.
2014-11-24 21:41:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet
2014-11-24 21:42:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you send me the address and time you're getting in?
2014-11-24 21:42:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I won't keep asking you? Lol
2014-11-24 21:43:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like email it?
2014-11-24 21:43:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or send it here
2014-11-24 21:43:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]815 Pierce St near Travis St (3:45 PM )  
2014-11-24 21:44:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Are you packed?? Are you excited???
2014-11-24 21:45:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Mostly packed.
2014-11-24 21:45:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I gotta bring the conditioner.
2014-11-24 21:45:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]50/50 I forget
2014-11-24 21:45:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Put it in there now!
2014-11-24 21:45:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm gonna shower in the morning.
2014-11-24 21:52:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you're not excited then  😔
2014-11-24 21:53:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm sure I will tomorrow.
2014-11-24 21:55:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why aren't you now?
2014-11-24 21:56:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not sure. Just in a funk I guess.
2014-11-24 21:57:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh I'm sorry 
2014-11-24 21:59:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://www.lehmiller.com/blog/2014/11/20/pubic-hair-removal-patterns-of-college-students-infographic
2014-11-24 21:59:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1 in 4 women want a hair free dude?
2014-11-24 22:03:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is ironic, I just some hair removal myself 
2014-11-24 22:03:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-11-24 22:05:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just did some myself 
2014-11-24 22:05:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh haha
2014-11-24 22:05:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does that number seem accurate to you?
2014-11-24 22:05:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you talked about it with any friends?
2014-11-24 22:06:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It seems pretty close
2014-11-24 22:06:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-11-24 22:07:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wait, as far as what women prefer?
2014-11-24 22:07:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-11-24 22:07:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That I don't really know
2014-11-24 22:08:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess there were girls in my sorority who mentioned to much in a guy
2014-11-24 22:08:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But not specifically preferring hair free
2014-11-24 22:08:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, trimmed makes sense
2014-11-24 22:09:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but 1 in 4 wanting completely bald is surprising to me
2014-11-24 22:09:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess 41% of dudes are hair-free at least some of the time, though
2014-11-24 22:09:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]according to that same chart
2014-11-24 22:10:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so maybe I'm just completely out of the loop
2014-11-24 22:13:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe 1:4 want it but don't openly ask for it
2014-11-24 22:14:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't want that, right?
2014-11-24 22:15:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha nooooo I keep telling you I don't care 
2014-11-24 22:15:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you wouldn't mind if I was shaven then?
2014-11-24 22:16:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you want to be shaven?
2014-11-24 22:16:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha not particularly
2014-11-24 22:16:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You do whatever makes you feel sexier ;)
2014-11-24 22:17:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aight
2014-11-24 22:20:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So are you really in the 60% that don't prefer hairless?
2014-11-24 22:21:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]40%
2014-11-24 22:21:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and yeah I guess so
2014-11-24 22:21:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I used to prefer hairless
2014-11-24 22:29:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yo how does Plan B work
2014-11-24 22:31:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it says "The  drug mainly prevents pregnancy by stopping the release of an egg from the ovary, and by preventing the fertilization of an egg  "  
2014-11-24 22:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have no idea how getting pregnant works
2014-11-24 22:31:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so when do the sperm and egg come together
2014-11-24 22:32:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I cum inside you
2014-11-24 22:32:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah I don't even know
2014-11-24 22:33:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it says it delays or inhibits ovulation
2014-11-24 22:33:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A woman ovulated about a week per cycle 
2014-11-24 22:33:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you're not ovulation when you take plan b
2014-11-24 22:34:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah
2014-11-24 22:34:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it doesn't work
2014-11-24 22:34:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you're ovulating
2014-11-24 22:34:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-11-24 22:34:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see
2014-11-24 22:34:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well duh
2014-11-24 22:34:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so wait
2014-11-24 22:34:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you have sperm inside you
2014-11-24 22:34:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and start ovulating a couple of days later
2014-11-24 22:34:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can get pregnant?
2014-11-24 22:34:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then what it does is prevent the fertilized egg from attaching to the wall of the uterus
2014-11-24 22:34:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the sperm are just hanging out somewhere inside you?
2014-11-24 22:34:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In your tunes
2014-11-24 22:35:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For up to 3-5 days 
2014-11-24 22:35:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*tubes
2014-11-24 22:35:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no kidding
2014-11-24 22:35:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had no idea
2014-11-24 22:35:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I never thought about it before
2014-11-24 22:35:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you have like all kinds of sperm swimming up inside you then
2014-11-24 22:35:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whenever we're together
2014-11-24 22:35:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't ovulate at all because I'm on birth control 
2014-11-24 22:35:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-11-24 22:36:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm chock full of sperm 
2014-11-24 22:36:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what tubes are they in?
2014-11-24 22:36:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're in my uterus and can go up the Fallopian tubes 
2014-11-24 22:36:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where they hope to find an ovary
2014-11-24 22:36:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But my birth control also thickens the uterine lining 
2014-11-24 22:36:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which slows the sperm down
2014-11-24 22:37:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interestin
2014-11-24 22:37:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]g
2014-11-24 22:37:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They hope to find an egg
2014-11-24 22:37:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh yeah
2014-11-24 22:37:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's crazy how long they persist
2014-11-24 22:37:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like really crazy
2014-11-24 22:37:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is it like stochastic?
2014-11-24 22:37:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure it exponentially gets less likely for them to be viable 
2014-11-24 22:38:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are there just sperm swimming in all kinds of directions?
2014-11-24 22:38:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or are they just waiting at the door of the ovary
2014-11-24 22:38:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]waiting for an egg to drop
2014-11-24 22:38:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know 
2014-11-24 22:39:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe they follow some chemical signal 
2014-11-24 22:40:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"The   vagina   and cervix do their part to encourage the sperm, emitting chemical signals that show the path for the seminal swimmers."
2014-11-24 22:40:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://health.howstuffworks.com/pregnancy-and-parenting/pregnancy/conception/human-reproduction9.htm
2014-11-24 22:41:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]only one of the Fallopian tubes contains an egg?
2014-11-24 22:41:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's hilarious
2014-11-24 22:41:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's all so random
2014-11-24 22:42:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this shit is interesting as fuck
2014-11-24 22:42:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha you're going to know more about it than me soon 
2014-11-24 22:43:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even with it being pretty random
2014-11-24 22:43:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like people with average fertility can probably get pregnant pretty easily
2014-11-24 22:43:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]knowing what I know now
2014-11-24 22:43:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's probably the case
2014-11-24 22:43:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You do release millions of sperm 
2014-11-24 22:43:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it just seemed kinda random to me before
2014-11-24 22:44:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like hope we get pregnant!
2014-11-24 22:44:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but now I see it's more like you have to actively try not to get pregnant
2014-11-24 22:44:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is obviously how it works
2014-11-24 22:45:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well yeah 
2014-11-24 22:47:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your basal body temperature changes and shit
2014-11-24 22:47:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you're pregnant?
2014-11-24 22:47:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no right in the window where you can get pregnant
2014-11-24 22:47:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's bonkers
2014-11-24 22:47:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:MenstrualCycle2_en.svg
2014-11-24 22:48:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, you take your temp when you're trying to get pregnant 
2014-11-24 22:48:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]look at all those hormones spiking
2014-11-24 22:48:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to know what that feels like
2014-11-24 22:48:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or monitor a specific hormone 
2014-11-24 22:48:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Really?
2014-11-24 22:48:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah 100%
2014-11-24 22:50:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You just find yourself wanting to cry for no reason 
2014-11-24 22:50:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is it always sad?
2014-11-24 22:50:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought women got really horny in the middle
2014-11-24 22:50:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe
2014-11-24 22:51:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably, I don't think I do 
2014-11-24 22:51:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because I'm on birth control 
2014-11-24 22:51:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right
2014-11-24 22:51:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I definitely get cranky around my period 
2014-11-24 22:51:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your face breaks out too because of the hormones 
2014-11-24 22:52:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I knew about that
2014-11-24 22:52:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I guess it's just some kind of imbalance that causes the mood swings?
2014-11-24 22:52:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I giess 
2014-11-24 22:53:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it's all estrogen's fault
2014-11-24 22:53:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"Increasing serotonin, and the number of serotonin receptors in the brain Modifying the production and the effects of endorphins, the "feel-good" chemicals in the brain Protecting nerves from damage, and possibly stimulating nerve growth"
2014-11-24 22:53:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]effects of estrogen
2014-11-24 22:54:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man that sucks!
2014-11-24 22:54:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-11-24 22:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]having a period
2014-11-24 22:54:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's completely unrelatable
2014-11-24 22:54:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for guys
2014-11-24 22:55:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Man, just think of how jealous you'll be when I'm pregnant!
2014-11-24 22:55:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-11-24 22:56:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I said before, I don't know why any women actually go through pregnancy
2014-11-24 22:57:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause they want a baby
2014-11-24 22:58:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah, but can you imagine if all of a sudden dudes had to get pregnant?
2014-11-24 22:58:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how fast would the population drop
2014-11-24 23:01:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Pretty fast
2014-11-24 23:04:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you had to get pregnant, would you?
2014-11-24 23:05:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's so hard to imagine
2014-11-24 23:05:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably not, though
2014-11-24 23:05:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Reality?
2014-11-24 23:05:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*really
2014-11-24 23:05:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why not?
2014-11-24 23:05:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's fucked up, man!
2014-11-24 23:06:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I don't have a little chemical in my brain telling me I want to grow a human inside me
2014-11-24 23:06:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you do want to have biological kids one day, right? 
2014-11-24 23:07:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-24 23:07:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So your desire to not be uncomfortable for 9 months at a time outweighs that desire? 
2014-11-24 23:08:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha maybe
2014-11-24 23:08:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like I said, it's hard to really imagine
2014-11-24 23:08:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's hard for me to imagine 
2014-11-24 23:08:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And when I do it sounds terrifying 
2014-11-24 23:09:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure.
2014-11-24 23:09:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But you think it's worth 9 months of discomfort?
2014-11-24 23:09:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno
2014-11-24 23:10:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've told you I think it's more socially responsible to adopt as well 
2014-11-24 23:10:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But, I also have nagging instincts to procreate 
2014-11-24 23:11:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the social impact of adopting is nil unless there's regulation
2014-11-24 23:12:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't like those arguments, like the one of why recycling is pointless 
2014-11-24 23:12:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]same with any sort of personal cause driven actions
2014-11-24 23:12:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it is pointless
2014-11-24 23:12:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Change has to start somewhere!
2014-11-24 23:12:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-11-24 23:12:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]by getting rich
2014-11-24 23:12:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and telling the government what to do
2014-11-24 23:13:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright, what about the impact of adopting a child that would otherwise live a terrible life and giving it a good one 
2014-11-24 23:13:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's good
2014-11-24 23:14:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Statistically insignificant, but still changing someone's life
2014-11-24 23:14:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if that's your motivation that's great
2014-11-24 23:15:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how many kids should you adopt in that case, though?
2014-11-24 23:15:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]isn't it kinda shitty to just adopt one?
2014-11-24 23:15:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you could support like 10?
2014-11-24 23:15:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]realistically
2014-11-24 23:15:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could probably provide food and shelter for 10 kids
2014-11-24 23:15:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and send them to a good school
2014-11-24 23:15:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your life wouldn't be awesome
2014-11-24 23:16:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but there lives would be crazy better than what they were born into
2014-11-24 23:16:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*their
2014-11-24 23:16:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want 2 kids. I decide whether I want them to be mine or adopt. 
2014-11-24 23:17:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I live my life how I'd like to while still improving 2 other lives substantially 
2014-11-24 23:17:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's fine if you frame it that way
2014-11-24 23:17:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that it's a selfish act
2014-11-24 23:18:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]making this kid's life better makes me feel good
2014-11-24 23:18:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're not adopting because you want to improve someone's life
2014-11-24 23:18:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or else you'd adopt as many as you could
2014-11-24 23:18:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm choosing adopting over giving birth 
2014-11-24 23:19:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because there are too many people on this planet, many of whom live shitty lives
2014-11-24 23:19:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What is your point? Did you not like the words "social responsibility" or something?
2014-11-24 23:20:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-11-24 23:21:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-11-24 23:21:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to bed. 
2014-11-24 23:21:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hope your funk is better tomorrow 
2014-11-24 23:25:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight 
2014-11-25 07:34:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Bring tennis shoes and the conditioner!
2014-11-25 08:45:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm at the airport 1:40 early!
2014-11-25 08:46:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's crazy! Why?
2014-11-25 08:49:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Darcy has class at 9 so I went a little early 
2014-11-25 08:50:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah, I see.
2014-11-25 08:53:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Man, my one roommate sleeps until like 10 or 11 all the fucking time and of course today he's up early and in the shower.
2014-11-25 08:53:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-11-25 08:53:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How are you getting to the bus stop?
2014-11-25 08:55:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Public transportation.
2014-11-25 08:55:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm probably gonna have to take a cold shower now.
2014-11-25 08:55:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're hot water is that bad?
2014-11-25 08:55:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*your
2014-11-25 08:56:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we'll find out.
2014-11-25 09:45:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cold?
2014-11-25 09:46:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lukewarm.
2014-11-25 09:46:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably cold to you.
2014-11-25 09:47:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha that's what I was about to say
2014-11-25 09:47:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What time does your bus leave?
2014-11-25 09:47:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Megabus?
2014-11-25 09:47:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-11-25 09:48:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]11:50
2014-11-25 09:49:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It takes less than 4 hours?
2014-11-25 09:49:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you're only going to downtown Houston 
2014-11-25 09:49:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-11-25 10:12:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]On the plane!
2014-11-25 10:12:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yay! See you six hours!
2014-11-25 10:14:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-11-25 10:36:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you pack a lunch?
2014-11-25 10:36:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nah. I'm probably gonna be pretty hungry.
2014-11-25 10:36:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're getting niko Nikos which is the best Greek food in Houston 
2014-11-25 10:36:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll get you a take out 
2014-11-25 10:37:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm getting doughnuts now, though, so hopefully I won't be too bad.
2014-11-25 10:37:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Protein!
2014-11-25 10:37:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks <3
2014-11-25 10:37:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I'll see what they have.
2014-11-25 10:37:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kolachessssss
2014-11-25 10:38:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Such a goofball.
2014-11-25 10:39:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do it
2014-11-25 10:41:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do doughnut shops always have kolaches?
2014-11-25 10:50:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Lol the doughnut shop I was gonna go to is closed.
2014-11-25 12:55:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]From a rivalry thread on the college football subreddit &quot;What do you call an attractive girl in Raleigh?<br/><br/>A cab back to Chapel Hill.&quot;
2014-11-25 13:30:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Noooo
2014-11-25 13:31:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do they stop for gas/smacks?
2014-11-25 13:31:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*snacks
2014-11-25 13:31:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just landed 
2014-11-25 13:32:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so. It's too short of a trip.
2014-11-25 13:34:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you're going to be cranky hungry
2014-11-25 13:34:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I went to a different place and got a couple of cream cheese Danishes
2014-11-25 13:35:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess that counts as protein 
2014-11-25 13:38:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We had a bumpy flight 
2014-11-25 13:48:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So you&#39;re getting lunch now?
2014-11-25 13:49:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh really? My messages are being delayed because I have spotty coverage.
2014-11-25 14:45:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, they're coming in with weird character errors too 
2014-11-25 14:46:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where are youuuuuuu
2014-11-25 14:46:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]70 miles.
2014-11-25 14:47:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Soooo it's going to be a little later than 3:45?
2014-11-25 14:48:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Google Maps says we'll be getting there right on time.
2014-11-25 14:49:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sweet
2014-11-25 15:28:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're 5 minutes away so just call as you're pulling in 
2014-11-25 15:29:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aight.
2014-11-25 15:54:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1.8 miles in heavy traffic.
2014-11-25 15:55:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My mom wants me to tell you we're illegally parked, but take your time! 
2014-11-25 15:55:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-11-25 16:00:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We're pulling in.
2014-11-26 09:41:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're missing puppy snugs 
2014-11-26 09:46:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha she's loving life.
2014-11-30 20:07:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My bus is delayed an hour :(
2014-11-30 20:12:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What number did you just call?
2014-11-30 20:12:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I called back the last number you called me with
2014-11-30 20:13:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably not my Google Voice one I guess.
2014-11-30 20:34:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There are still spots open on the 8:15a and 1:15p buses back to Dallas 
2014-11-30 20:34:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]FYI 
2014-11-30 20:35:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Thanks, sugar. The bus is pulling in, though.
2014-11-30 20:35:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much!
2014-11-30 20:35:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Whew!
2014-11-30 20:36:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Love you too my dear
2014-11-30 21:15:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Good news: I finally figured out how to get LTE working on my phone. Bad news: I'm still waiting on the bus. That one that pulled wasn't ours apparently.
2014-11-30 21:16:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not really sure what's going on actually. A second bus has come and gone without any people on it too.
2014-11-30 21:17:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Shit
2014-11-30 21:17:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is there someone official there who knows what's going on? Or a number you can call? 
2014-11-30 21:18:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]There are the loaders, but it looks like they're waiting too so I'm assuming a bus is coming.
2014-11-30 21:19:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:(
2014-11-30 21:19:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why can't things ever just work out when we travel? Lol
2014-11-30 21:19:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Probably my last Megabus trip. I appreciate it being an affordable mode of transportation, but I won't miss it.
2014-11-30 21:20:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I know.
2014-11-30 21:23:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm boarding, but if you do decide to give up just call my mom!
2014-11-30 21:23:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you a ton
2014-11-30 21:23:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Cool. I miss you too.
2014-12-01 00:05:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]In Chicago, where are you?
2014-12-01 01:11:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hopefully you're napping. Text me when you get home though so I know you're safe, I'm going to crash. Mwah!
2014-12-01 01:13:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]16 more miles on the bus. Goodnight, beautiful.
2014-12-01 01:16:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I meant to text you about how I couldn't help daydreaming about you inside of me on the drive to the bus stop. I was still basking in that afterglow. 
2014-12-01 01:18:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) I already can't wait to be inside you again.
2014-12-01 01:20:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I really dig all the eye contact you make when giving me head.
2014-12-01 01:20:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a lot easier when you're standing up 
2014-12-01 01:21:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I liked doing it too 
2014-12-01 01:22:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah it seemed like it was more natural for you.
2014-12-01 01:23:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Guess I should give you head on my knees more often ;)
2014-12-01 01:24:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I won't object to that. I think our place clearly needs to have a carpeted room.
2014-12-01 01:24:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely 
2014-12-01 01:25:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or we find a nice soft carpet to put in there 
2014-12-01 01:25:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For sure.
2014-12-01 01:25:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Stashes of pillows and blankets in every corner in case we don't want to make it to the bed 
2014-12-01 01:26:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:) I love you.
2014-12-01 01:26:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you too, so incredibly much! 
2014-12-01 01:26:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Alright I'm going to bed for reals 
2014-12-01 01:27:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Be safe, I'll talk to you tm 
2014-12-01 01:27:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. Goodnight.
2014-12-01 09:59:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we can get student tickets for Christmas carol for $35 each, but you have to snag them 10a the morning of the show and it's possible there aren't 2 next to each other
2014-12-01 10:00:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or we can get fairly decent seats on Tues 12/16 for $70 each 
2014-12-01 10:01:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you have to physically pick them up/
2014-12-01 10:02:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No online 
2014-12-01 10:03:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we've probably got pretty good odds of finding two seats next to each other on a day then, right?
2014-12-01 10:04:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Eh maybe, for Dec 3 there's only 2 pairs still available

2014-12-02 08:51:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No heat again this morning 
2014-12-02 08:51:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😰
2014-12-02 09:10:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]WTF man?
2014-12-02 09:11:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had a dream you broke up with me :(
2014-12-02 09:13:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's strange
2014-12-02 09:13:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I had a dream I was trying to date you and this other dude at the same time 
2014-12-02 09:14:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it wasn't working 
2014-12-02 09:14:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha why not?
2014-12-02 09:15:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno
2014-12-02 09:15:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You and him weren't down with sharing 
2014-12-02 09:15:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why did I break up with you?
2014-12-02 09:15:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Interesting.
2014-12-02 09:18:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. It seemed like you still loved me. It was a weird dream. We were in this like indoor rainforest that had a place to live in it with a bunch of other young people.
2014-12-02 09:18:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You feeling tied down?
2014-12-02 09:18:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nooooo
2014-12-02 09:20:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then I became a vampire and a really old Cameron Diaz came to kill me and steal my awesome house and since the other guy was human only he could I invite her 
2014-12-02 09:20:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*uninvite 
2014-12-02 09:20:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And she stabbed him through the heart with her fingernails 
2014-12-02 09:21:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha wow.
2014-12-02 10:16:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you said you had read The Ethical Slut the other night, right?
2014-12-02 10:16:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I read parts of it 
2014-12-02 10:16:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-12-02 10:16:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why?
2014-12-02 10:18:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just thought it was interesting, considering our previous discussions. And I thought it was odd because of the way you talk about polyamory sometimes.
2014-12-02 10:23:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That book does not advocate that polyamory is for everyone or every relationship, but rather gives some advice about how to be polyamorous if you think it's right for you
2014-12-02 10:24:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get that, but you sort of use "polyamory" and "open relationship" interchangeably.
2014-12-02 10:25:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Always getting on me about exact language lol
2014-12-02 10:25:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're completely different philosophies
2014-12-02 10:26:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You can have an open relationship with polyamory 
2014-12-02 10:27:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, exchange polyamory in my previous comment with open relationship 
2014-12-02 10:27:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's what I meant to say
2014-12-02 10:29:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can be polyamorous in an open relationship?
2014-12-02 10:30:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If that's ok with you and your partner 
2014-12-02 10:30:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, the comment before that
2014-12-02 10:30:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]About the ethical slut 
2014-12-02 10:31:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That book does not advocate that open sexual relationships are for everyone or every relationship, but rather gives some advice about how to be in one if you think it's right for you
2014-12-02 10:32:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How is that odd based on what I talk about sometimes?
2014-12-02 10:32:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because you're not very down with the polyamory scenario
2014-12-02 10:32:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess you might just have been intrigued
2014-12-02 10:33:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The book is not about polyamory per sw
2014-12-02 10:33:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*se
2014-12-02 10:33:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's about enjoying sex and not cheating on someone to get it 
2014-12-02 10:33:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right, I guess you were interested in the open relationship part?
2014-12-02 10:34:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've told you, I don't disagree with polyamory-I don't even write it off entirely for us one day- I just don't want it right now in our relationship 
2014-12-02 10:35:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I read it cause I was bored with speciation 
2014-12-02 10:35:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh I see
2014-12-02 10:35:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll be very surprised if neither of us has sex or a relationship outside of our relationship
2014-12-02 10:35:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*ever has
2014-12-02 10:35:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why?
2014-12-02 10:36:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because we don't have any moral obligation to monogamy?
2014-12-02 10:37:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess my philosophy about our relationship is "if it's not broke don't fix it". 
2014-12-02 10:38:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because if we do stay together for the rest of our lives that would be a long time
2014-12-02 10:39:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We are staying together for the rest of our lives, mister 
2014-12-02 10:40:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well odds are one of us will get bored at some point or meet someone new who is really interesting and excites them
2014-12-02 10:40:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and yeah we don't have any religious obligation to monogamy
2014-12-02 10:41:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well when that happens we'll talk about it, ok? 
2014-12-02 10:41:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not just because it happened in our dreams 
2014-12-02 10:41:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Jackie Kennedy also got an engagement bracelet 
2014-12-02 10:42:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha OK, I'm honestly not really worried about it anymore
2014-12-02 10:42:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when the time inevitably comes we'll deal with it
2014-12-02 10:42:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]odds are if one of us wants out the other one will too
2014-12-02 10:43:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I still think that's probably not going to be pleasant
2014-12-02 10:43:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]someone's feelings are going to be hurt
2014-12-02 10:44:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess that's part of having no morals
2014-12-02 10:44:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhhhh please stop
2014-12-02 10:44:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Putting negative feelings on our radar over hypothetical situations 
2014-12-02 10:45:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really think it's hypothetical, but I get your point
2014-12-02 10:45:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not happening right now 
2014-12-02 10:45:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]exactly
2014-12-02 10:46:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you keep giving me orgasms like you do, it's not going to happen for a longgg time lol 
2014-12-02 10:46:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least on my end 
2014-12-02 11:55:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm getting a rentalll
2014-12-02 11:55:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. What are you getting?
2014-12-02 11:58:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't know yet, enterprise is picking me up 
2014-12-02 11:59:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They think they have it until at least friday though 
2014-12-02 12:00:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you paying for the rental?
2014-12-02 12:00:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, insurance is 
2014-12-02 12:00:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK. That's what I thought.
2014-12-02 12:01:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I might have to pay $500 and then get a $500 check once their insurance clears, but w/e
2014-12-02 12:01:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Points on points on points 
2014-12-02 12:01:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-12-02 12:34:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Put you as my emergency contact :)
2014-12-02 12:35:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awwww  😘   
2014-12-02 12:39:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also they thought John Silliman was my husband and asked why he wasn't on my emergency contact list 
2014-12-02 12:39:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lololol
2014-12-02 12:39:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice. I wonder what made them think that?
2014-12-02 12:40:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]His name is on the policy and he owns the car 
2014-12-02 12:40:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah, makes sense
2014-12-02 12:40:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should look into how insurance works if you're driving the car 
2014-12-02 12:41:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it doesn't matter
2014-12-02 12:41:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since I don't own it either 
2014-12-02 12:41:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm not on your parents' policy
2014-12-02 12:43:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It might provide coverage for other drivers of our insured cars. I'll ask 
2014-12-02 12:45:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I bought 2 video games yesterday 
2014-12-02 12:45:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What what cyber Monday 
2014-12-02 13:03:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nice. What'd you get?
2014-12-02 13:13:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Chevy sonic 
2014-12-02 13:13:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's pretty fancy
2014-12-02 13:14:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And makes me realize how shitty the sound is in my car 
2014-12-02 13:14:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I meant games this time haha
2014-12-02 13:14:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah new cars have pretty nice sound systems these days.
2014-12-02 13:15:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Destiny and the Evil Within 
2014-12-02 13:15:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For $65 total
2014-12-02 13:15:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nice. I want to try The Evil Within.
2014-12-02 13:16:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah it has good reviews 
2014-12-02 13:17:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You should wait and play it with me :)
2014-12-02 13:17:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not 2 player though 
2014-12-02 13:18:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We can go take turns unless you don't think you'd like that.
2014-12-02 13:18:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No that'd be fun 
2014-12-02 13:20:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Remind me to look at n_out if I complain about my project later.
2014-12-02 13:23:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]N_out!
2014-12-02 13:24:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How's it going?
2014-12-02 13:25:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I hit a wall earlier and it was really frustrating me, but I think (hope) this n_out thing will fix it.
2014-12-02 13:25:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If that works I'll be on the home stretch I think.
2014-12-02 13:25:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice 
2014-12-02 13:25:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It'll just be fucking around with the architecture.
2014-12-02 13:26:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Word
2014-12-02 13:29:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't wait to live with you and be married to you.
2014-12-02 14:12:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]http://imgur.com/mbOPX2L.jpg
2014-12-02 14:13:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If I ask you to wear a heart monitor one day, don't think anything of it.
2014-12-02 14:50:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:))) I can't wait either 
2014-12-02 19:16:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you totally could've just convinced me to put a heart monitor on before my proposal without me knowing 
2014-12-02 19:16:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Think of the data!
2014-12-02 19:16:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dammmmmnnnnn
2014-12-02 19:17:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We could've both had heart monitors on 
2014-12-02 19:18:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And turned our graphs into a cute picture on the mantle 
2014-12-02 19:19:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I effed it up
2014-12-02 19:19:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would be interesting because there's probably a nice lag in heart rate between the guy and the girl
2014-12-02 19:19:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Exactly 
2014-12-02 19:33:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Babeeeee, come have a study party with me
2014-12-02 19:33:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, it's probably for the best we can't.
2014-12-02 19:34:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think we actually work pretty well around each other 
2014-12-02 19:34:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless one of us is not really working 
2014-12-02 19:34:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like last Friday ;)
2014-12-02 19:36:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I guess you're right
2014-12-02 19:36:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I let you work!
2014-12-02 19:36:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]With a hug every 10 minutes 
2014-12-02 19:37:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nooo
2014-12-02 19:37:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]every 15
2014-12-02 19:37:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that goofy lovey smile you have that I can't resist 
2014-12-02 19:38:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the guy I sit next to in Algorithms is from Katy
2014-12-02 19:38:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he also thinks I should make an app
2014-12-02 19:38:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's his name?
2014-12-02 19:39:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Nathan I think.
2014-12-02 19:39:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]He went to a Jesuit school, though.
2014-12-02 19:40:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Strake Jesuit
2014-12-02 19:40:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But he did graduate the same year as you I think.
2014-12-02 19:40:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I dunno.
2014-12-02 19:41:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's the only Jesuit school in katy 
2014-12-02 19:41:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]then I suppose that's probably it!
2014-12-02 19:41:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😋
2014-12-02 19:41:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-12-02 19:53:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you so much!
2014-12-02 19:53:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was thinking today how next semester is gonna be a drag.
2014-12-02 19:53:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It feels like our long-distanceness is coming to an end kinda.
2014-12-02 19:53:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it's just a tease.
2014-12-02 19:54:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll get all those free weekends though
2014-12-02 19:54:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]To hang out with me or do some traveling 
2014-12-02 19:54:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]true
2014-12-02 19:55:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that should keep me entertained
2014-12-02 19:56:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm really looking forward to this month together, though
2014-12-02 19:56:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]meeee toooo
2014-12-02 19:56:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll finally be together long enough that we can almost feel like a normal relationship 
2014-12-02 19:57:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, that'll be really nice.
2014-12-02 19:57:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We'll be able to plan dinners and stuff.
2014-12-02 19:57:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Go grocery shopping 
2014-12-02 19:58:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep    😃 
2014-12-02 20:00:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe we'll have our first in person fight!
2014-12-02 20:00:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😮 
2014-12-02 20:00:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can't wait!
2014-12-02 20:01:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't imagine a fight getting too out of control in person.
2014-12-02 20:01:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't either 
2014-12-02 20:01:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless one of us was being particularly pigheaded 
2014-12-02 20:02:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha implying me?
2014-12-02 20:02:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can be pigheaded 
2014-12-02 20:03:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we're more likely to get in a fight from you getting frustrated about being bored than anything else
2014-12-02 20:04:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I'm going to try to be aware of that
2014-12-02 20:05:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or be aware of when you're getting frustrated in general
2014-12-02 20:05:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should be better about using my words 
2014-12-02 20:05:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not just impatient body movement lol
2014-12-02 20:06:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah that might help
2014-12-02 20:22:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-12-02 20:22:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that you love me for who I am 
2014-12-02 20:24:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw I love you too
2014-12-02 20:24:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and that you love me for who I am!
2014-12-02 20:24:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're crazy patient with me
2014-12-02 20:26:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9F-xDIbgg
2014-12-02 20:26:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have you listened to the Sufjan Christmas albums?
2014-12-02 20:29:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've heard some of the songs 
2014-12-02 20:29:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's some of my favorite music, Christmas or not
2014-12-02 20:29:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And definitely had it in the background, but haven't really listened to them 
2014-12-02 20:30:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sufjan is great 
2014-12-02 20:31:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One year I want a record player for Christmas 
2014-12-02 20:32:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fo sho
2014-12-02 20:37:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]moms be loving the Thanksgiving album
2014-12-02 20:43:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except my mom, of course
2014-12-02 20:43:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because she's jealous
2014-12-02 20:44:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She hasn't liked it?
2014-12-02 20:44:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nope
2014-12-02 20:44:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hasn't liked any of the pictures either
2014-12-02 20:45:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh dear 
2014-12-02 20:45:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's all good
2014-12-02 20:51:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're going to get to make Christmas cards next year!
2014-12-02 20:51:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll take a fireplace picture with Flo
2014-12-02 20:51:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-12-02 20:51:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh lord
2014-12-02 20:52:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe two cards
2014-12-02 20:53:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should pick me out a Christmas sweater
2014-12-02 20:53:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I'll order it
2014-12-02 20:56:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You want a Christmas sweater for this year?
2014-12-02 20:56:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-12-02 20:57:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:) 
2014-12-02 21:24:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Watching the new Carrie
2014-12-02 21:24:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how is it?
2014-12-02 21:24:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A little intense 
2014-12-02 21:24:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But good
2014-12-02 21:25:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-12-02 21:26:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you read the book or seen the earlier movie?
2014-12-02 21:26:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope
2014-12-02 21:26:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know she gets blood dumped on her
2014-12-02 21:26:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and burns the motha down
2014-12-02 21:26:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I don't really know the plot at all
2014-12-02 21:26:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Essentially
2014-12-02 21:27:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Her mother is like straight up crazy 
2014-12-02 21:59:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We left the bag of brownie brittle!
2014-12-02 22:02:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I've been thinking about it.
2014-12-02 22:02:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really didn't need this bag of candy either.
2014-12-02 22:02:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha I know 
2014-12-02 22:02:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Be careful with the sugar overload 
2014-12-02 22:03:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll probably end up tossing most of it.
2014-12-02 22:03:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Give it to people 
2014-12-02 22:03:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like who?
2014-12-02 22:04:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The dog 
2014-12-02 22:04:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-12-02 22:04:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]good idea
2014-12-02 22:04:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my model is working
2014-12-02 22:04:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]barely
2014-12-02 22:04:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-12-02 22:04:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Working is better than nothing 
2014-12-02 22:05:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]truth. It means I'll have something to talk about in a report.
2014-12-02 22:05:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm only testing artist recognition right now
2014-12-02 22:05:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is a pretty hard task anyway
2014-12-02 22:05:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'll be curious to see how the movement classifier does
2014-12-02 22:05:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if I had more hardware it would be better
2014-12-02 22:06:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I had to scale down all the pictures to 100x100 pixels
2014-12-02 22:06:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just to make it able to run
2014-12-02 22:06:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that loses a lot of detail
2014-12-02 22:06:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you use something on campus?
2014-12-02 22:07:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm I don't think so
2014-12-02 22:07:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I would need a cluster I think
2014-12-02 22:07:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the fact that it's working at all is pretty interesting, though
2014-12-02 22:08:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely seems possible
2014-12-02 22:08:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Want me to break you into the cluster?
2014-12-02 22:08:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha hmmm
2014-12-02 22:08:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not at the moment
2014-12-02 22:08:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is more a proof of concept
2014-12-02 22:08:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if the professor likes it maybe I'll look into more horsepower
2014-12-02 22:09:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is definitely something Google should be doing
2014-12-02 22:09:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they have that Google Art Project
2014-12-02 22:09:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]where they have huge high res images of works of art
2014-12-02 22:09:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth 
2014-12-02 22:10:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe there are but they haven't figured out how to make money off of it 
2014-12-02 22:10:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Google makes money by being useful
2014-12-02 22:10:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then advertising to the billions of people who find them useful
2014-12-02 22:11:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting stuff
2014-12-02 22:11:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe I'll do a PhD in Australia?
2014-12-02 22:11:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they last 3 years there usually
2014-12-02 22:12:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-12-02 22:13:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll have to get scuba verified 
2014-12-02 22:13:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*certified 
2014-12-02 22:14:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fo sheezy
2014-12-02 22:21:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was getting a massage the other day when I had to ask the guy 'Is it normal to get an erection during this procedure?' 'Yes', he said, 'that's perfectly normal'. To which I replied 'Well can you at least get it out of my face?'
2014-12-02 22:21:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-12-02 22:24:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't cum from a blow job again
2014-12-02 22:24:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]!
2014-12-02 22:24:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well I guess I did
2014-12-02 22:25:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but not in your mouth and it wasn't an awesome ending
2014-12-02 22:25:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-12-02 22:26:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:(
2014-12-02 22:26:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's actually the second time a brother has ruined the ending of a blowjob for me
2014-12-02 22:27:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess that's what happens when you have sex at home 
2014-12-02 22:36:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]my model is over twice as accurate as a naive model
2014-12-02 22:36:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's still bad
2014-12-02 22:36:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-12-02 22:36:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]there are 100 different artists to choose from
2014-12-02 22:36:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the most frequent artist occurs 4.01% of the time in the test set
2014-12-02 22:37:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so just guessing the most frequent artist every time gives you an accuracy of 4.01%
2014-12-02 22:37:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]after two hours of training I got up to 9.64%!
2014-12-02 22:37:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's 2.4x better!
2014-12-02 22:37:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-12-02 22:57:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wooo
2014-12-02 23:54:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Guess what?
2014-12-02 23:54:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-12-02 23:56:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to marrrrryyyyyyy you
2014-12-02 23:56:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I nuzzle your neck every night until you dieeee
2014-12-02 23:57:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-12-02 23:57:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm loling
2014-12-02 23:57:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was creepy
2014-12-02 23:58:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😳
2014-12-02 23:59:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just realized I left "will"
2014-12-02 23:59:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Out
2014-12-02 23:59:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah, I got the message
2014-12-03 00:00:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm going to be your cuddle slave for the rest of my life
2014-12-03 00:03:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll be your cuddle slave too
2014-12-03 00:04:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can't be a slave if you're willing
2014-12-03 00:04:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]...........
2014-12-03 00:04:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're such a goofball!
2014-12-03 00:04:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]come get in bed with me and push your butt into my crotch
2014-12-03 00:05:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's more of an aggressive wiggle than a push
2014-12-03 00:05:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh yeah?
2014-12-03 00:06:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's how I intend it
2014-12-03 00:07:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you push yourself back into me
2014-12-03 00:07:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]initially
2014-12-03 00:07:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to make contacty
2014-12-03 00:07:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-12-03 00:07:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]contact
2014-12-03 00:11:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-12-03 00:13:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd kill to do that right now 
2014-12-03 00:14:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm gonna try to go to sleep, even sans cuffing
2014-12-03 00:14:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*cuddling
2014-12-03 00:14:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah! I love you so much
2014-12-03 00:15:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]goodnight, sugar. I love you.
2014-12-03 00:15:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You'll be here for the cookie decorating party!
2014-12-03 00:15:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]eff yeah
2014-12-03 00:15:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]find me a Christmas sweater so I can have it by then!
2014-12-03 00:16:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I actually already bought you a Christmassy sweater to open on Christmas 
2014-12-03 00:16:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I guess it makes more sense to get it before 
2014-12-03 00:17:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'll be 1 fewer present under our 2' tree though 
2014-12-03 00:17:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you know... Christmas doesn't come from a store    😉 
2014-12-03 00:18:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes it does 
2014-12-03 00:18:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha goodnight dear
2014-12-03 00:18:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet dreams, beautiful
2014-12-03 08:45:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RBTpRaws5ts
2014-12-03 09:38:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha is that a hint?
2014-12-03 12:54:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your dad sent me a hangouts message 
2014-12-03 12:54:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was very confusing, since you guys have the same name
2014-12-03 12:55:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's funny
2014-12-03 12:55:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he got a Nexus 5
2014-12-03 12:55:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and texts are sent through the Hangouts app
2014-12-03 12:55:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but Hangouts defaults to Hangouts
2014-12-03 12:55:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]rather than texts
2014-12-03 12:55:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Makes sense 
2014-12-03 12:55:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's probably why he sent you a Hangouts message
2014-12-03 12:56:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what'd he want?
2014-12-03 12:57:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Asking if I'm ready for the Alcorn clan
2014-12-03 12:57:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what a goofy mofo
2014-12-03 12:58:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know what I'd think if your mom just randomly messaged me all the time
2014-12-03 13:02:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He's asked me this like 3 times now too lol
2014-12-03 13:02:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's ok, it's just funny
2014-12-03 13:03:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is he texting your other siblings bf/gf too?
2014-12-03 13:03:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sure he texts Emily
2014-12-03 13:40:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will this be you one day?
2014-12-03 13:42:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha in a way
2014-12-03 13:42:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I won't be complaining about the procrastination as much as the "WHY AREN'T YOU READY YET?" with zero warning
2014-12-03 13:42:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your wife will still probably procrastinate in 30 years 
2014-12-03 13:43:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt about that    😉 
2014-12-03 13:47:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're going to have a stocking decorating party with Darcy and make stockings for us and the cats
2014-12-03 13:47:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha I actually have something to show you when I get there.
2014-12-03 13:48:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can show you now I guess.
2014-12-03 13:48:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What is it??
2014-12-03 13:49:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have a live wallpaper on my phone.
2014-12-03 15:12:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The picture never came through 
2014-12-03 15:22:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:))))
2014-12-03 15:22:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha you're adorable 
2014-12-03 16:48:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man :(. At least your boobs still look good.
2014-12-03 17:01:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha thanks honey 
2014-12-03 17:06:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] All I've eaten today is 2 spoons of yogurt, a tortilla, and a small piece of turkey 
2014-12-03 17:07:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think I'm going to make it home 
2014-12-03 17:07:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh lord, you about to unleash the hanger?
2014-12-03 17:09:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I skipped hangry and went straight to hunger-induced depression 
2014-12-03 17:09:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hungression?
2014-12-03 17:11:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw, man. You should have something tasty and filling for dinner.
2014-12-03 17:28:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I am super out of groceries 
2014-12-03 17:28:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kinda just want a big juicy burger 
2014-12-03 17:35:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you should get one!
2014-12-03 19:59:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mwah!
2014-12-03 20:00:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-12-03 20:03:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have slightly less hungression 
2014-12-03 20:04:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What're you up to,
2014-12-03 20:04:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]just watched the lighting of the Rockefeller tree special
2014-12-03 20:04:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and watching the SNL Christmas special now
2014-12-03 20:04:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]while my neural network trains
2014-12-03 20:04:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not Saturday  though 
2014-12-03 20:05:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's a clip special from a bunch of old episodes
2014-12-03 20:05:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what'd you have to eat?
2014-12-03 20:07:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The Multicultural Graduate Community was having an event at the pub, so I went for some free wings and convinced Daniela  to get me a burger 
2014-12-03 20:07:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then I met up with Haley for coffe and a catch up chat
2014-12-03 20:08:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahanice
2014-12-03 20:09:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you 
2014-12-03 20:09:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I miss you too... a whole bunch.
2014-12-03 20:09:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I promise to never take for granted the joy of coming home to you every night 
2014-12-03 20:10:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]awwww
2014-12-03 20:10:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 😘 😘 😘 😘 😘      
2014-12-03 20:12:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'll be hard to not be homebodies for a while
2014-12-03 20:12:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you think?
2014-12-03 20:13:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you do a lot of stuff now.
2014-12-03 20:14:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hard to say 
2014-12-03 20:14:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm going to be undeniably less of a homebody
2014-12-03 20:14:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's because I don't do shit right now
2014-12-03 20:14:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I can see you potentially doing less out of the house if you wanted to
2014-12-03 20:15:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Being on a couch/bed/floor/wall with you is just usually more enjoyable than interacting with most other people 
2014-12-03 20:16:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm sure it's healthy to have some variety 
2014-12-03 20:16:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah. We'll definitely still get out plenty, but we'll have plenty of loving nights with just the two of us too.
2014-12-03 20:16:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't wait, man.
2014-12-03 20:17:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We deserve this month together coming up.
2014-12-03 20:18:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We definitely do 
2014-12-03 20:19:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I finished all the dna extractions I need today 
2014-12-03 20:19:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. So what's left on the agenda?
2014-12-03 20:19:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I think I'm on track to be totally done by 12/15
2014-12-03 20:19:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet
2014-12-03 20:19:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Quantifying 96 DNS extracts 
2014-12-03 20:19:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Making 96 libraries 
2014-12-03 20:19:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Running some gels 
2014-12-03 20:20:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-12-03 20:21:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'll be so crazy to be that free with you for that long 
2014-12-03 20:21:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We can snuggle all day!
2014-12-03 20:23:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know. I'm also glad this is the month we get to spend together during our long-distance phase.
2014-12-03 20:24:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth
2014-12-03 20:25:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I just really love sharing my life with you :)
2014-12-03 20:25:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know you make my heart totally melt with those statements?
2014-12-03 20:26:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha maybe, but that's not my motivation for saying them ;)
2014-12-03 20:27:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That makes it even better!
2014-12-03 20:29:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]All this sweet talk is just making me miss you super hard.
2014-12-03 20:29:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well then get here already 
2014-12-03 20:31:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]A little over a week and we'll at least be sleeping in the same bed, even if we're not spending a lot of time together during the day.
2014-12-03 20:31:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ahhhh
2014-12-03 20:31:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Expect to be aggressively straddled every night that 1st week 
2014-12-03 20:32:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or at least I'll try to before falling down from exhaustion 
2014-12-03 20:33:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha I think I can handle that.
2014-12-03 20:33:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I believe in you 
2014-12-03 20:35:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have I ever mentioned how lucky I am?
2014-12-03 20:36:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe once or twice 
2014-12-03 20:36:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'd be luckier if we didn't have to live the first 14 months of our relationship apart
2014-12-03 20:37:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe, or maybe we're establishing a really strong foundation by being long-distance at first
2014-12-03 20:38:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess we'll never know 
2014-12-03 20:38:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was a surprisingly pessimistic response
2014-12-03 20:38:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you must be feeling down about us being apart
2014-12-03 20:39:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't mean it to be!
2014-12-03 20:39:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I meant it to be whimsically retrospective 
2014-12-03 20:39:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ohhh
2014-12-03 20:42:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We'll never know if our relationship is stronger because of the circumstances, all I know is how amazingly connected to you I am 
2014-12-03 20:43:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀  I love how you emphasize our connection
2014-12-03 20:47:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it has a mystical/cosmic quality to it
2014-12-03 20:57:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not totally ridiculous/nonsensical though
2014-12-03 20:58:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't implying that!
2014-12-03 21:01:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know I know darlinv 
2014-12-03 21:01:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*darling
2014-12-03 21:01:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hope you're getting work done in the midst of all this lovey dovey 
2014-12-03 21:02:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#modeltraining
2014-12-03 21:02:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I actually feel a lot less stress
2014-12-03 21:02:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was worried I'd be completely lost trying to use this new framework
2014-12-03 21:02:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is that the equivalent of sending libraries off to be sequenced? In 3+ weed you get some results?
2014-12-03 21:02:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I had to learn it from scratch
2014-12-03 21:03:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-12-03 21:03:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]kinda
2014-12-03 21:03:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except my results are updated every 20 minutes
2014-12-03 21:03:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth, I don't get any validation til after I've spent $1800 
2014-12-03 21:04:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what are you doing?
2014-12-03 21:04:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I decided to skip AHS tonight 
2014-12-03 21:04:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm feeling like staying in and playing dead space in my sweats 
2014-12-03 21:05:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice. I sill have to finish Dead Space.
2014-12-03 21:05:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]1 and 2?
2014-12-03 21:06:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the "Let's Do It on My Twin Bed" sketch is on
2014-12-03 21:06:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1
2014-12-03 21:07:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is this on nbc right now?
2014-12-03 21:07:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-12-03 21:08:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]people like our date picture
2014-12-03 21:08:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause we cuteee
2014-12-03 21:08:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-12-03 21:09:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm just surprised by what people like sometimes
2014-12-03 21:09:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess people like dates
2014-12-03 21:09:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and this might be getting pushed the top of people's News Feeds
2014-12-03 21:09:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because it got a lot of likes in a relatively short amount of time
2014-12-03 21:09:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which means more people see it
2014-12-03 21:11:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you feel up for a sexy snap?
2014-12-03 21:11:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Give it to meh
2014-12-03 21:11:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or do you want one?
2014-12-03 21:11:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want one
2014-12-03 21:11:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-12-03 21:14:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ooooh very nice
2014-12-03 21:16:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want your mouth on my titties 
2014-12-03 21:16:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for sure
2014-12-03 21:17:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you know what's a bummer
2014-12-03 21:17:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What?
2014-12-03 21:17:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't suck your titties while you give me head
2014-12-03 21:19:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If only 
2014-12-03 21:19:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love when you massage my tits while I give you head though 
2014-12-03 21:20:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah? Well I like it too, so that's good. Haha.
2014-12-03 21:21:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's funny when you grab them in the tempo you want me to suck you off
2014-12-03 21:21:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At least I assume that's what it means 
2014-12-03 21:21:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't think so
2014-12-03 21:21:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless it's subconsioius
2014-12-03 21:22:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I won't take it that way then lol
2014-12-03 21:23:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you know what felt pretty good
2014-12-03 21:23:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]?
2014-12-03 21:23:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when you were like on top of me sucking my dick facing down
2014-12-03 21:24:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you were like sideways I think
2014-12-03 21:24:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and we had to stop to eat dinner
2014-12-03 21:24:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like 69?
2014-12-03 21:24:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it wasn't 69, though
2014-12-03 21:25:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish we would've went longer so I could've pinpointed what it was
2014-12-03 21:25:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I know what you're talking about but you'll have to show me
2014-12-03 21:25:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we just sort of did it spur of the moment over break
2014-12-03 21:26:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I like pushed your head down
2014-12-03 21:26:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so we just ended up in that position
2014-12-03 21:29:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure we'll find it again 
2014-12-03 21:29:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Was it the angle that felt good? 
2014-12-03 21:30:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm I don't think so, well maybe
2014-12-03 21:30:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it just felt really good in your mouth
2014-12-03 21:31:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😄
2014-12-03 21:34:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll give you a few cum-in-my-throat blowjobs this break 
2014-12-03 21:34:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yessss
2014-12-03 21:36:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not getting to cum in your mouth the other day was probably one of the most frustrating sexual experiences of my life
2014-12-03 21:36:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:(((((((((
2014-12-03 21:36:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's ok
2014-12-03 21:37:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I like when you cum in my mouth too 
2014-12-03 21:38:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know... it's fucking sexy
2014-12-03 21:38:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wonder if how much someone enjoys the taste of their partner's cum us correlated with their emotional feelings for them at all
2014-12-03 21:39:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be an interesting study
2014-12-03 21:39:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably be tough to do, though
2014-12-03 21:39:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-12-03 21:39:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the other day was actually the first time you didn't seem like you were enjoying giving me the blow job too
2014-12-03 21:39:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was a little bit of a bummer
2014-12-03 21:40:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I told you, I felt like I was doing a bad job 
2014-12-03 21:40:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then it was a negative feedback 
2014-12-03 21:44:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I was paranoid about someone coming in
2014-12-03 21:45:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I don't anticipate having those feelings very often if at all again while going down on you 
2014-12-03 21:46:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hooray
2014-12-03 21:53:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send me a sexy snap 
2014-12-03 21:53:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or at least one of your sexy face 
2014-12-03 21:53:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you want?
2014-12-03 21:53:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just want to see you 
2014-12-03 22:08:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh baby
2014-12-03 22:09:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😉 
2014-12-03 22:13:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My sexy hunk of love meat, I'm falling asleep 
2014-12-03 22:14:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ok my goddess of orgasms
2014-12-03 22:15:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahaha
2014-12-03 22:15:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I actually laughed out loud at that 
2014-12-03 22:15:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah?
2014-12-03 22:16:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's true, though!
2014-12-03 22:16:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goddess of your orgasms, or orgasms in general? 
2014-12-03 22:17:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]both
2014-12-03 22:17:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you are the goddess of orgasms
2014-12-03 22:17:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I have to see you to receive them
2014-12-03 22:17:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a Greek shrine to you would have you orgasming
2014-12-03 22:17:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with one of your hands squeezing your tit
2014-12-03 22:17:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and copies of me
2014-12-03 22:17:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one fucking you
2014-12-03 22:17:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]one sucking your other tit
2014-12-03 22:18:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the other with my dick near your mouth with your other hand on it
2014-12-03 22:18:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe cumming in your mouth
2014-12-03 22:18:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh mannnnnn
2014-12-03 22:18:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If that scene could actually happen 
2014-12-03 22:18:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It'd be the pinnacle of my life 
2014-12-03 22:19:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What could possibly feel better?
2014-12-03 22:19:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you tell me!
2014-12-03 22:19:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I already think that the pleasure you give me rivals any drug high 
2014-12-03 22:20:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]doesn't surpass :(((
2014-12-03 22:20:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dude 
2014-12-03 22:21:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It surpasses it 
2014-12-03 22:21:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I told you in March that the post coital cuddles made me feel like I was high 
2014-12-03 22:22:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that was before we had optimized anything 
2014-12-03 22:22:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah you did
2014-12-03 22:22:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-12-03 22:22:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]optimized
2014-12-03 22:22:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you were convinced it was all pheromones back then
2014-12-03 22:24:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe some subconscious part of me recognized a complementary part in you before the rest of me did 
2014-12-03 22:25:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's so crazy how love is illogical but makes so much sense when you're in it!
2014-12-03 22:25:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do you mean?
2014-12-03 22:26:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]At the beginning, it didn't make any "logical sense" for us to feel as strongly for each other as we did 
2014-12-03 22:26:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We didn't know each other 
2014-12-03 22:26:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it 'felt' so right 
2014-12-03 22:26:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It still feels like such a perfect match 
2014-12-03 22:27:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it really does
2014-12-03 22:27:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's hard for me to believe that you feel that way still sometimes
2014-12-03 22:27:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's hard for me to believe you really feel that way 
2014-12-03 22:27:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know why. You're amazing.
2014-12-03 22:28:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't really know I was capable of feeling this strongly for someone, much less that other people could feel it too
2014-12-03 22:28:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, really?
2014-12-03 22:29:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Loving you has given me an entirely new perspective on what love can be 
2014-12-03 22:29:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, honey    💜 
2014-12-03 22:30:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have actually thought about how my love for you feels vs. previous relationships
2014-12-03 22:30:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and being in love with you excites me
2014-12-03 22:31:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's not just comforting and emotional
2014-12-03 22:31:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's invigorating
2014-12-03 22:32:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's the passion on every single level 
2014-12-03 22:33:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And there are no compromises with you, but even the things that might not be ideal are still things I love about you, and oddly look forward to navigating amd deal kin with got the rest of my life
2014-12-03 22:33:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*dealing with for 
2014-12-03 22:33:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ugh I hate this phone 
2014-12-03 22:34:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And staring into your eyes makes me SO HAPPY 
2014-12-03 22:35:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I want to say every cliche ever made about lovers staring into each other's eyes
2014-12-03 22:35:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha aw
2014-12-03 22:36:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah we have a really strong connection when we make eye contact
2014-12-03 22:36:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I particularly notice it when we're having sex sometimes
2014-12-03 22:37:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Definitely 
2014-12-03 22:37:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or cuddling all wrapped up in each other and smiling 
2014-12-03 22:38:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah    😃 
2014-12-03 22:38:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]12) I love how you acknowledge we will have challenges in our relationship, but are unwavering in your love for me and our ability to confront them.
2014-12-03 22:38:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seriously
2014-12-03 22:38:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you are so confident in us
2014-12-03 22:38:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and so convinced of your love for me
2014-12-03 22:39:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well duh, we're awesome
2014-12-03 22:39:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Other couples could only aspire to be us 
2014-12-03 22:39:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-12-03 22:40:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if we can get through this distance, we can get through anything 
2014-12-03 22:40:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except murder  
2014-12-03 22:40:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol drawing the line at murder
2014-12-03 22:40:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]?
2014-12-03 22:40:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you murdered a close family member, that'd be hard  
2014-12-03 22:41:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]guess I'll have to take that one off the bucket list    😕 
2014-12-03 22:41:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Flo, Daniel, mom, Schatze are all off limits 
2014-12-03 22:41:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Shadow

2014-12-04 10:13:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This was definitely a parent anxiety dream 
2014-12-04 10:14:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The people who live above us are arguing very loudly 
2014-12-04 10:15:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's no fun
2014-12-04 10:15:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]"Fuck you, this is your problem"

2014-12-04 10:16:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😞 
2014-12-04 10:21:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This video of Charlotte doing ballet is adorable

2014-12-04 10:27:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha

2014-12-04 10:28:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no doubt
2014-12-04 10:28:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]has my dad mentioned the sleeping arrangements to you in his texts?
2014-12-04 10:28:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-12-04 10:28:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No
2014-12-04 10:28:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What is it?
2014-12-04 10:29:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know. I was just wondering if he talked to you about it.
2014-12-04 10:29:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I stopped texting him back
2014-12-04 10:29:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will he be offended by that?
2014-12-04 10:29:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I don't know.
2014-12-04 10:37:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why don't you just ask you parents about the sleeping arrangements?
2014-12-04 10:38:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was just curious. There's nothing we can do about it anyway.
2014-12-04 10:38:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where have you slept before with a gf?
2014-12-04 10:40:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a couch pull-out
2014-12-04 10:40:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that was in Disney World
2014-12-04 10:40:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]with Autumn
2014-12-04 10:40:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't remember what Hannah and I did in Disneyland
2014-12-04 10:40:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wasn't that more recent?
2014-12-04 10:41:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it was
2014-12-04 10:41:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably split a room with Zane and Noelle maybe?
2014-12-04 10:43:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Will we be allowed to snuggle if we share a room?
2014-12-04 10:44:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We're going to be sleeping in the same bed, or are you asking something else?
2014-12-04 10:44:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can we spoon? Or do we have to do chaste/no touching cuddling?
2014-12-04 10:45:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh no we can spoon.
2014-12-04 10:45:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't quite understand your mother's take on that stuff
2014-12-04 10:46:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Don't ask, don't tell.
2014-12-04 10:46:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]When you say sex stuff makes her very uncomfortable 
2014-12-04 10:46:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We won't be in the same room as her for sure.
2014-12-04 10:47:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to buy a guide book
2014-12-04 10:47:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]For Disney?
2014-12-04 10:48:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes!
2014-12-04 10:48:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My family might have one. We definitely have older ones.
2014-12-04 10:52:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Only one more week until I get to see yo fine ass again.
2014-12-04 10:52:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I know!
2014-12-04 10:53:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should be able to pick you up too
2014-12-04 10:53:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yay!

2014-12-04 10:55:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well maybe not, maybe I can take one night off
2014-12-04 10:57:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well I'm assuming you're at least allowing for 20 minutes before going back to work.
2014-12-04 10:57:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obvs
2014-12-04 10:58:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:D
2014-12-04 10:58:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's likely that 20 minutes leads to 90 with a little post-orgasm nap
2014-12-04 10:59:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well you'll just be super revitalized after then!
2014-12-04 10:59:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sureee
2014-12-04 11:01:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And if a round two happens? So be it.
2014-12-04 11:01:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Just kidding. I'm not gonna be a bad influence.
2014-12-04 11:02:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was factoring a round 2 into the 90 minutes 
2014-12-04 11:02:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Followed by a 2 hour nap
2014-12-04 11:03:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And then it's dinner time!
2014-12-04 11:05:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha of course you were, hence my intent to spend the rest of my life with you.

2014-12-04 22:45:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think they've had sex
2014-12-04 22:45:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And he doesn't sleep over 
2014-12-04 22:45:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But she says she really likes him 
2014-12-04 22:46:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm intrigued to see them interact at the party tomorrow
2014-12-04 22:46:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so they cuddle and shit, though?
2014-12-04 22:47:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh yeah 
2014-12-04 22:47:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mostly play video games and watch movies 
2014-12-04 22:47:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-12-04 22:48:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess they haven't been with another person in 2-4 years
2014-12-04 22:48:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe they're taking it slow 
2014-12-04 22:48:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which means I can't watch movies or play video games though
2014-12-04 22:49:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's kinda inconvenient
2014-12-04 22:49:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't really imagine taking it slow
2014-12-04 22:49:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I could if I had just gotten out of a relationship
2014-12-04 22:50:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't have wanted even any semblance of romance, though
2014-12-04 22:52:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So you would take things slow with no romance? 
2014-12-04 22:52:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't even be taking things slow
2014-12-04 22:53:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that soon after I got dumped by Hannah
2014-12-04 22:53:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would be either meaningless sex or nothing
2014-12-04 22:54:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mutual affection can be nice in a rebound though 
2014-12-04 22:54:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wouldn't have been interested
2014-12-04 22:54:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, both of them were the dumpers
2014-12-04 22:54:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's a good point
2014-12-04 22:55:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Would you have had sex right after Hannah if the opportunity presented itself?
2014-12-04 22:55:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]probably
2014-12-04 22:57:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If only my program had been 75% Australian women instead of 75% Indian men
2014-12-04 22:57:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha if only 
2014-12-04 22:58:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it might only be 60% Indian men
2014-12-04 22:58:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]15% Indian women
2014-12-04 22:58:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which doesn't really improve my odds
2014-12-04 23:00:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you had been shacking up with Australian women every weekend though, you might not have been so interested in dating someone you barely knew long distance 
2014-12-04 23:00:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]damn
2014-12-04 23:00:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the perfect experiment
2014-12-04 23:00:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's actually a pretty bad experiment 
2014-12-04 23:01:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why?
2014-12-04 23:02:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Since we have no ability for replication 
2014-12-04 23:02:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we don't have 2 versions of you 
2014-12-04 23:03:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why would we need replication?
2014-12-04 23:03:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well we would need you to meet me with a harem of Australian woman and for you to meet me without the harem  
2014-12-04 23:04:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see.
2014-12-04 23:04:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think only with the harem would be satisfactory.
2014-12-04 23:12:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love getting in warm freshly cleaned sheets!
2014-12-04 23:30:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess you do not share dis love
2014-12-04 23:31:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha it's nice I suppose
2014-12-05 00:34:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You didn't tell me good night :/
2014-12-05 00:35:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Whoops! Goodnight!
2014-12-05 00:35:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't love me 
2014-12-05 00:36:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha nope.
2014-12-05 00:37:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Send me a goodnight snap
2014-12-05 00:37:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I haven't seen your face in decades
2014-12-05 00:40:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Can't even do it. I'd have to turn on the light.
2014-12-05 00:40:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Okkk
2014-12-05 00:40:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you better send me s good morning one!
2014-12-05 00:41:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha OK I'll try to remember.
2014-12-05 08:04:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Colin stayed over last night 
2014-12-05 08:05:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And Chuy spent and hour and a half wailing at Darcys door
2014-12-05 08:05:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was pretty funny/terribly annoying
2014-12-05 10:09:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha oh man.
2014-12-05 10:57:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You forgot my snap
2014-12-05 10:57:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]😭
2014-12-05 10:59:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Much better 
2014-12-05 10:59:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll stop being so clingy now
2014-12-05 10:59:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I doubt that    😉 
2014-12-05 16:19:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish I didn't go here 
2014-12-05 16:19:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish I was in a lab that actually has funding for the research I want to do, and has people doing the research I want to do 
2014-12-05 16:20:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you want to talk?
2014-12-05 16:20:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So they can help me when I have stupid methods questions because people write shitty protocols
2014-12-05 16:22:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I'm sorry you're having a rough time    😞 
2014-12-05 16:22:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Have you considered getting someone outside UChicago on your committee?
2014-12-05 16:23:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Maybe doing some lab work externally?
2014-12-05 16:23:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes, I probably will 
2014-12-05 16:23:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But this is sequencing stuff 
2014-12-05 16:23:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Someone at this fucking school should be able to help me!
2014-12-05 16:24:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But max, one of the few ppl I know who has done this method  on a non model species, is clueless 
2014-12-05 16:24:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]He just does what someone told him to, with no idea how anything world 
2014-12-05 16:24:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Works
2014-12-05 16:25:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And you don't really have the resources for trial and error.
2014-12-05 16:25:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because I'm sure you could figure it out if that were the case.
2014-12-05 16:34:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well I love you. I know you'll figure it out because you're smart, talented, and stubborn.
2014-12-05 16:38:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks honey 
2014-12-05 17:06:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's just extra frustrating because I'm on this time crunch 
2014-12-05 17:06:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I already designed primer sequences o think will work, I just need someone to say "yes" or "no"
2014-12-05 17:07:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, well if any of your time crunch is due to me you don't have to worry about it
2014-12-05 17:08:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The guy who's letting me use a machine of theirs for free leaves the 18
2014-12-05 17:08:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So that's the biggest crunch 
2014-12-05 17:08:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]pj PL
2014-12-05 17:08:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-12-05 17:08:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that I want to be done before we leave for Disney 
2014-12-05 17:11:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll definitely still be working the first few days you're here
2014-12-05 17:12:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which sucks, but it'll make the rest of the month so much better 
2014-12-05 17:14:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's completely OK!
2014-12-05 17:15:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't want to be another source of stress for you.
2014-12-05 17:16:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're not 
2014-12-05 17:17:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your one of my biggest sources of relaxation and comfort and happiness 
2014-12-05 17:17:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀  good. That's what I want to be. 
2014-12-05 23:03:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you

2014-12-06 00:37:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I was going to say "I love you" or something
2014-12-06 00:37:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha oh OK
2014-12-06 00:37:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]fuck you
2014-12-06 00:38:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why do you have to act like this?
2014-12-06 00:39:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]should I never talk about my past interactions with men again?
2014-12-06 00:39:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't mind
2014-12-06 00:39:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like hearing about it
2014-12-06 00:40:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so did you have sex at Reuel's place when you were home for break?
2014-12-06 00:40:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what were the logistics of taht?
2014-12-06 00:40:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you and Brett didn't hook up again after Austin?
2014-12-06 00:40:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why do you like hearing about this?
2014-12-06 00:40:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]cuz i find it interesting
2014-12-06 00:40:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why?
2014-12-06 00:41:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because you were sleeping with different dudes in close proximity to each other
2014-12-06 00:41:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]temporally
2014-12-06 00:41:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and your emotional involvement with them is complex I guess?
2014-12-06 00:42:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and maybe hidden?
2014-12-06 00:42:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to a degree?
2014-12-06 00:42:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]hidden from whom?
2014-12-06 00:42:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me
2014-12-06 00:42:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it's not hidden
2014-12-06 00:42:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I didn't realize you and Brett were like going on dates
2014-12-06 00:43:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we never went on a date
2014-12-06 00:43:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and going home with each other from Christmas parties
2014-12-06 00:43:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and staying with each other regularly?
2014-12-06 00:43:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you misled me
2014-12-06 00:43:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]early on
2014-12-06 00:43:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is interesting
2014-12-06 00:43:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I said we slept together but he ignored me otherwise
2014-12-06 00:43:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did y'all hook up after Austin?
2014-12-06 00:43:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]which is true
2014-12-06 00:43:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no
2014-12-06 00:44:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you didn't sleep with anyone until February?
2014-12-06 00:44:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yup
2014-12-06 00:44:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how did I mislead you
2014-12-06 00:44:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]?
2014-12-06 00:44:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you made it sound like no one knew about it
2014-12-06 00:44:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I told you we went to see kanye together
2014-12-06 00:44:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if you ever told me that
2014-12-06 00:44:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did 
2014-12-06 00:44:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when?
2014-12-06 00:45:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]right when we started seeing each other in march, it cam up
2014-12-06 00:45:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]he and Simon had tickets together, but the concert got moved and simon couldn't go
2014-12-06 00:45:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's the only reason I could
2014-12-06 00:46:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think people knew about it, but we did leave the holiday party together
2014-12-06 00:47:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]now that I realize how much ppl gossip about that shit, maybe someone knew
2014-12-06 00:47:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like everyone knew
2014-12-06 00:47:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not sure who wouldn't know 
2014-12-06 00:47:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at this point
2014-12-06 00:47:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]based on what you've told me
2014-12-06 00:47:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haley didn't
2014-12-06 00:47:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]she knew in Austin?
2014-12-06 00:48:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]nope
2014-12-06 00:48:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at least that Brett was interested?
2014-12-06 00:48:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or no
2014-12-06 00:48:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that you wanted Brett's D
2014-12-06 00:48:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]she thought  was kinda interested, but had no idea we had a history
2014-12-06 00:48:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]* I was
2014-12-06 00:49:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dallas didn't know until one night in Dec. when he came over to smoke and Brett stayed after he left
2014-12-06 00:50:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I mean, I don't really care
2014-12-06 00:50:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]really?
2014-12-06 00:50:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't believe you
2014-12-06 00:50:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why not?
2014-12-06 00:50:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you hung up on me
2014-12-06 00:50:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]abruptly
2014-12-06 00:50:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I didn't hang up
2014-12-06 00:50:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you think I misled you
2014-12-06 00:50:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you said goodnight?
2014-12-06 00:50:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said goodnight.
2014-12-06 00:50:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and hung up
2014-12-06 00:50:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]whatever
2014-12-06 00:51:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, fuck me
2014-12-06 00:51:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't like when you act like you're not unhappy
2014-12-06 00:51:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or annoyed
2014-12-06 00:51:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not annoyed
2014-12-06 00:51:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]let's talk more
2014-12-06 00:51:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have questions about how you fucked Reuel
2014-12-06 00:51:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you go to his place?
2014-12-06 00:52:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whose cum tastes the best?
2014-12-06 00:52:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the way you phrase that does not make me happy
2014-12-06 00:52:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does your favorite position change with guy?
2014-12-06 00:52:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you're upsetting me
2014-12-06 00:52:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or is it consistent?
2014-12-06 00:52:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]why?
2014-12-06 00:53:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sometimes it's so hard to stay positive and understanding with you
2014-12-06 00:53:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what am I doing?
2014-12-06 00:53:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]would it help if I asked these questions on video?
2014-12-06 00:54:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to know how you fucked Hannah
2014-12-06 00:54:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]tell me all about how you fucked her
2014-12-06 00:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]anything specific?
2014-12-06 00:54:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and how her cum tasted
2014-12-06 00:55:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-12-06 00:55:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]are you ok with those questions?
2014-12-06 00:55:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I am.
2014-12-06 00:55:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well, then we're different people
2014-12-06 00:55:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you've upset me. if you want I'll explain tomorrow but I'd rather not talk to you while you're acting like this
2014-12-06 00:56:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]explain what tomorrow?
2014-12-06 00:56:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why you upset me, because clearly you don't get it
2014-12-06 00:56:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't like talking about your sexual history I guess
2014-12-06 00:57:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]why can't you ever realize you're being a jerk while you're actually doing it?
2014-12-06 00:57:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]dude
2014-12-06 00:57:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not being a jerk
2014-12-06 00:57:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm genuinely curious
2014-12-06 00:57:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]about these things
2014-12-06 00:58:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you've had a lot more varied sexual experience than I have
2014-12-06 00:58:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it intrigues me
2014-12-06 00:58:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]especially when you fuck two guys within a week of each other
2014-12-06 00:58:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that you were sort of emotionally involved with
2014-12-06 00:58:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's pretty interesting
2014-12-06 00:58:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Tell me how Hannah's cum tasted
2014-12-06 00:59:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really remember
2014-12-06 00:59:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-12-06 00:59:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What was you favorite position with her?
2014-12-06 00:59:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ummm
2014-12-06 00:59:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess doggy
2014-12-06 00:59:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]have I ever told you I had problems cumming quickly with her?
2014-12-06 01:00:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I came quickly
2014-12-06 01:00:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or if it was because we always did mutual masturbation frist
2014-12-06 01:00:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]*first
2014-12-06 01:00:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which made me not last long once penis was in vagina
2014-12-06 01:00:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe you just found her more sexually stimulating than me?
2014-12-06 01:00:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's interesting
2014-12-06 01:00:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think so too!
2014-12-06 01:01:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was actually worried I would have that problem with you.
2014-12-06 01:01:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But that doesn't seem to be the case.
2014-12-06 01:01:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But we also weren't having sex that frequently.
2014-12-06 01:01:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When she worked at the school for kids with autism she was always really tired during the week.
2014-12-06 01:01:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I think I emotionally drained her.
2014-12-06 01:02:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't imagine how you emotionally drained her
2014-12-06 01:02:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah
2014-12-06 01:03:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP](that's sarcasm, by the way)
2014-12-06 01:03:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe you should complain to her about my issues
2014-12-06 01:03:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]thanks for clarifying
2014-12-06 01:03:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]what the fuck is wrong wit you
2014-12-06 01:03:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-12-06 01:04:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to sleep 
2014-12-06 01:04:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Goodnight 
2014-12-06 01:06:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd like to imagine that one day when we live together and you see that the way you're speaking to me is making me cry, you'll relent a little bit 
2014-12-06 01:06:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But what if that's not the case?
2014-12-06 01:07:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe it's not worth the risk?
2014-12-06 01:07:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I shouldn't ask you about your relationship/sex history
2014-12-06 01:07:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we actually shouldn't talk when you're drunk
2014-12-06 01:07:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we established that before
2014-12-06 01:08:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I swear, in any state I would be upset by the way you asked me about my sexual history tonight 
2014-12-06 01:08:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was aggressive
2014-12-06 01:08:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it wasn't aggressive
2014-12-06 01:09:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm sorry you felt that way
2014-12-06 01:09:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No you're not!
2014-12-06 01:09:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or I'm sorry I made you feel that way
2014-12-06 01:09:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't trying to make you feel bad.
2014-12-06 01:09:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But you won't tell me why it actually made you feel bad.
2014-12-06 01:09:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes you were!
2014-12-06 01:09:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Other than claiming it was aggressive.
2014-12-06 01:09:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]When it wasn't.
2014-12-06 01:09:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or at least I didn't intend for it to be taken that way.
2014-12-06 01:10:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Fine, I tell you the way you're speaking to me is upsetting me and you don't care 
2014-12-06 01:10:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You say I shouldn't be upset 
2014-12-06 01:11:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's my fault 
2014-12-06 01:11:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm too sensitive 
2014-12-06 01:11:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]didn't say either of those things
2014-12-06 01:12:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're right, I'm just drunk 
2014-12-06 01:28:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]see... that's hanging up.
2014-12-06 01:28:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yup
2014-12-06 01:28:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel ridiculous
2014-12-06 01:28:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I'm not going to get the compassion and understanding I want from you right now so I'm cutting out
2014-12-06 01:29:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't like realizing I'm in a relationship with a man that smiles at me when I'm upset
2014-12-06 01:30:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds like you're getting a lot of red flags tonight.
2014-12-06 01:31:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]instead if trying to get me to break up with you, why don;t you just apologize?
2014-12-06 01:31:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I already said I'm sorry I made you feel that way.
2014-12-06 01:31:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you still haven't explained WHY it's bothering you
2014-12-06 01:31:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you thought my use of "fuck" and "cum" were aggressive
2014-12-06 01:32:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm sorry I phrased my questions that way.
2014-12-06 01:32:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and they followed up after you were annoyed by me hanging up on you
2014-12-06 01:32:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but denying you were anoyed
2014-12-06 01:33:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you want my take on the situation?
2014-12-06 01:33:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sure
2014-12-06 01:33:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]actually, no. I'm not going to do that.
2014-12-06 01:33:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]please, I'd like to hear it
2014-12-06 01:34:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think you lose your ability to keep your emotions in check when you're drunk.
2014-12-06 01:34:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So you fly off the deep end pretty quickly when something upsets you.
2014-12-06 01:35:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My hanging up really upset you
2014-12-06 01:35:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you never came down from being un upset
2014-12-06 01:35:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so something that might only slightly bother you normally
2014-12-06 01:35:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP](asking you questions about your sex/relationship history)
2014-12-06 01:35:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]were being magnified
2014-12-06 01:35:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or amplified
2014-12-06 01:36:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you accused me of misleading you
2014-12-06 01:37:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]right, something that would probably only marginally bother you normally.
2014-12-06 01:37:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I never like being accused of being a liar
2014-12-06 01:38:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and there are enough occurrences now of you (in my opinion) aggressively asking me about my sexual history even while sober that have upset me 
2014-12-06 01:38:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I realize that.
2014-12-06 01:38:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not annoyed let's talk more I have questions about how you fucked Reuel did you go to his place? whose cum tastes the best?
2014-12-06 01:39:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you've admitted to being a little annoyed
2014-12-06 01:39:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so you are lying here
2014-12-06 01:39:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and you should know by now that a string of questions like this upset me
2014-12-06 01:39:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]sober or otherwise
2014-12-06 01:40:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is it possible for you to not get upset about a string of questions like that?
2014-12-06 01:40:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I feel like that'd be an easy solution.
2014-12-06 01:40:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Like, just not give a fuck.
2014-12-06 01:41:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not going to make this
2014-12-06 01:41:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]make what?
2014-12-06 01:42:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This makes me feel like you don't know me at all
2014-12-06 01:43:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like you don't care about who I am at all 
2014-12-06 01:43:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I try to accept you for your quirks and your issues 
2014-12-06 01:44:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But if you can't do that for me, then what are we even doing 
2014-12-06 01:44:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I should wait until I'm 100% sober to break up with you 
2014-12-06 01:44:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right?
2014-12-06 01:44:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]are you breaking up with me?
2014-12-06 01:45:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're treating me in a way I don't appreciate at all
2014-12-06 01:45:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I keep telling you I don't like it 
2014-12-06 01:45:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You ignore lev
2014-12-06 01:45:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*me
2014-12-06 01:47:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why does this happen every time?
2014-12-06 01:47:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What if we're really shitty for each other, but our incompatibilities are masked by the distance? 
2014-12-06 01:48:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd say they're pretty obvious?
2014-12-06 01:48:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what incompatibility could possibly be hidden at this point
2014-12-06 01:49:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, what if they aren't just a factor of distance? 
2014-12-06 01:49:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why have you never asked about my sexual history in person?
2014-12-06 01:49:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Except when rolling, and then you forgot it 
2014-12-06 01:49:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd say that counts
2014-12-06 01:49:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]even if I did forget it
2014-12-06 01:51:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm going to bed 
2014-12-06 01:51:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we broken up?
2014-12-06 01:51:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you want 
2014-12-06 01:52:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm the drunken, overly sensitive one 
2014-12-06 01:52:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why would you date someone whom won't tell you about their cum preference after being accused of being a liar?
2014-12-06 01:54:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1) I didn't call you a liar, I said you misled me. I then backed off on that to saying I felt like you didn't tell me the whole truth, but it sounds like you thought you did.
2014-12-06 01:54:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]2) Because I'm in love with you.
2014-12-06 01:54:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You bring me all kinds of happiness in a ton of different ways.
2014-12-06 01:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which is fucking obvious.
2014-12-06 01:54:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But do what you want.
2014-12-06 01:54:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If you aren't breaking up with me, quit saying it.
2014-12-06 01:55:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know you're drunk and whatever and people with ADHD can lose their filter, but take that out of your vernacular unless you absolutely mean it.
2014-12-06 01:56:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not going to deal with you using our relationship as an argument tactic.
2014-12-06 01:58:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What can I use to drive home the point that you are upsetting me then!
2014-12-06 01:58:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you said that to me, I would feel bad about what I was doing or saying 
2014-12-06 01:58:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I would avoid talking like that in the future 
2014-12-06 01:59:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What else can I say other than: you're upsetting me, please stop?
2014-12-06 01:59:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-12-06 01:59:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want you to read our conversation
2014-12-06 01:59:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]tomorrow
2014-12-06 01:59:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]from the point where you say "you're upsetting me"
2014-12-06 02:00:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you ask me
2014-12-06 02:00:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a bunch of questions
2014-12-06 02:00:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which I guess you thought would make me realize why they were upsetting you
2014-12-06 02:00:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they didn't bother me at all
2014-12-06 02:00:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I answered them
2014-12-06 02:00:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then you said
2014-12-06 02:00:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]"what the fuck is wrong with you"
2014-12-06 02:04:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You said you found her more sexually stimulating than me
2014-12-06 02:04:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what?
2014-12-06 02:06:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like you don't understand what upsets me 
2014-12-06 02:06:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wasn't agreeing with you about her being more sexually stimulating
2014-12-06 02:06:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought your "that's interesting"
2014-12-06 02:06:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]was just in response to what I was saying
2014-12-06 02:06:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I was agreeing with that
2014-12-06 02:07:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't enjoy imagining you loving another woman 
2014-12-06 02:08:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's weird you seem to want to imagine me doing that 
2014-12-06 02:10:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should not have responded to you upsetting me by asking you similar questions 
2014-12-06 02:10:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I should've just kept repeating I was unhappy with the conversation 
2014-12-06 02:11:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I will not use that tactic in the future 
2014-12-06 02:13:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I will not threaten to break up with you, even when I feel like I don't want to stay in a relationship with someone who does not give me the same acceptance I give them 
2014-12-06 02:13:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll just stop responding to you 
2014-12-06 02:13:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Night 
2014-12-06 02:25:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate going to sleep upset because of us 
2014-12-06 02:26:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Same here.
2014-12-06 02:26:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is it all my fault?
2014-12-06 02:27:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No and I don't know why you're so concerned with assigning blame.
2014-12-06 02:28:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hate this 
2014-12-06 02:28:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What?
2014-12-06 02:28:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If it's because of me I want to fix it 
2014-12-06 02:29:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe I should stop caring about the sexual history stuff
2014-12-06 02:29:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's just most every other conversation we've had about it had been distressing to you somehow 
2014-12-06 02:31:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it was partly jealousy issues and some lingering moral issues with promiscuity.
2014-12-06 02:32:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]By "moral" I mean my response.
2014-12-06 02:33:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I have slightly complex issues with my previous promiscuity 
2014-12-06 02:33:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Clearly 
2014-12-06 02:34:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that isn't clear to me.
2014-12-06 02:35:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Mans I don't like giving you fodder for something I don't think us healthy for you to think about 
2014-12-06 02:37:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So it bothers you because you think I shouldn't think about it?
2014-12-06 02:37:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a big part of it 
2014-12-06 02:38:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why is that your decision to make?
2014-12-06 02:38:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why do you care if I think about it?
2014-12-06 02:39:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]After you made me tell you about every guy I've slept with at 2a, I kinda hoped those conversations  were over 
2014-12-06 02:39:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You said they'd be 
2014-12-06 02:39:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you just admitted they stemmed from jealousy 
2014-12-06 02:40:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I said they were distressing for that reason. I like confronting those issues, though.
2014-12-06 02:42:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't like distressing you 
2014-12-06 02:42:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because of things in my past 
2014-12-06 02:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not distressed.
2014-12-06 02:44:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You were lying at one point in the conversation- how can I believe you about anything else?
2014-12-06 02:44:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You aren't totally honest about what does/doesn't bother you 
2014-12-06 02:44:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you shouldn't.
2014-12-06 02:46:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you, ok?
2014-12-06 02:46:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You make me crazy happy 98% of the time 
2014-12-06 02:47:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We just have to get better about this stuff 
2014-12-06 02:47:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I feel like I'm beating a dead horse
2014-12-06 02:48:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't ask you about your sexual history? Is that what you want?
2014-12-06 02:48:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If you ever fuck other guys I'm gonna ask you about it.
2014-12-06 02:48:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or won't that be allowed either?
2014-12-06 02:49:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]1) I want you to be completely honest about why you want to know. And "because its interesting" is not valid 
2014-12-06 02:50:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]2) I'd like you to find ways to ask me about it that does not feel aggressive to me 
2014-12-06 02:50:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because I want to know what you were like with other guys.
2014-12-06 02:50:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]1 question at a time, with limited profanity helps 
2014-12-06 02:50:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why?
2014-12-06 02:51:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What kind of explanation will be satisfactory to you?
2014-12-06 02:51:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why do you want to know?
2014-12-06 02:51:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm curious. I want to know if things were the same or different.
2014-12-06 02:52:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If other guys did things better/worse.
2014-12-06 02:52:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why does that matter in regards to our relationship? 
2014-12-06 02:52:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What you did differently.
2014-12-06 02:53:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess it prepares me for the open relationship better.
2014-12-06 02:53:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]How?
2014-12-06 02:54:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I get to know what you seek out better and what you get out of being with different guys.
2014-12-06 02:55:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've told you multiple times, I don't like the idea of preparing for  a hypothetical open relationship right now 
2014-12-06 02:57:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It sounds to me, like you're looking for me to contradict my stance that "you are the best sex I've ever had" a little by saying things I preferred in other men 
2014-12-06 02:58:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No, I don't think that's the case.
2014-12-06 02:58:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if we ever engage in polyamory, the things i will seek out will be completely different than what I sought out while single and lonely 
2014-12-06 02:59:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]In what way?
2014-12-06 03:00:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I won't be single and lonely 
2014-12-06 03:00:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't even imagine what my relationship deficiencies will be right now, because they're aren't any 
2014-12-06 03:04:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ok, I guess I can't justify asking those questions. I'll stop.
2014-12-06 03:05:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How did you going home with Brett even come up? I guess something about him not leaving with Laura?
2014-12-06 03:06:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We should just not talk about our past relationships.
2014-12-06 03:06:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That seems best.
2014-12-06 03:08:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]K
2014-12-06 03:08:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Works for me
2014-12-06 03:08:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Perfect.
2014-12-06 03:10:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And we are not currently in an open relationship? Or it's don't ask, don't tell?
2014-12-06 03:10:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you want to be?
2014-12-06 03:11:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought we had established there were no rules.
2014-12-06 03:12:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Then why are you asking about rules?
2014-12-06 03:12:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm asking about transparency.
2014-12-06 03:13:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've said you don't want to hook up with other women now 
2014-12-06 03:13:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The no rules meant what we could engage in I thought.
2014-12-06 03:13:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think I told you, if that changes I'd like to know 
2014-12-06 03:13:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-12-06 03:13:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But you are free to hook up with whomever 
2014-12-06 03:14:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But I should let you know?
2014-12-06 03:14:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't give me all the details, but yes 
2014-12-06 03:15:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And if you fall in love with someone else, definitely tell me. But I'll probably be really upset 
2014-12-06 03:15:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I'd want to know beforehand with you.
2014-12-06 03:15:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-12-06 03:15:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm not planning on doing that 
2014-12-06 03:16:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I start to feel like I want to I'll let you know 
2014-12-06 03:16:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Like I've said 
2014-12-06 03:16:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You don't care if the notice comes before or after?
2014-12-06 03:16:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For you? No 
2014-12-06 03:16:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-12-06 03:17:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why, has it already happened? 
2014-12-06 03:17:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No.
2014-12-06 03:17:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you tried to make it happen?
2014-12-06 03:18:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No.
2014-12-06 03:19:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why are you asking about all of this then?
2014-12-06 03:19:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why does it keep coming up?
2014-12-06 03:19:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So I know the rules going forward.
2014-12-06 03:20:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nothing has changed in the past 3-4 conversations about this 
2014-12-06 03:20:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We hadn't established what and when I was supposed to tell you.
2014-12-06 03:21:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I'd like to know if you're actively looking, but I also realize things can just happen unplanned 
2014-12-06 03:21:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So, whatever. Just tell me 
2014-12-06 03:21:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If you didn't tell me until after that you slept with a guy after I asked you to tell me beforehand I'd be upset.
2014-12-06 03:21:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's why I'm trying to clarify.
2014-12-06 03:21:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I won't do that!
2014-12-06 03:22:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know, I'm just saying why I'm asking.
2014-12-06 03:22:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]To make sure I don't do something similar to you.
2014-12-06 03:22:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think I'm going to hook up with someone?
2014-12-06 03:23:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It could happen. You made out with that one chick.
2014-12-06 11:11:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I reread things while sober
2014-12-06 11:12:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sorry that I was antagonistic at times and seemed to be overly sensitive to how you were acting 
2014-12-06 11:13:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I still am pretty unhappy about how you were talking to me, though 
2014-12-06 11:13:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that the open relationship thing reared its head again 
2014-12-06 11:15:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If you want an open relationship, that's fine. But please please stop bringing it up because you think I secretly want one now, or will want one in the future, ok?
2014-12-06 11:32:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I'm having issues with my internet.
2014-12-06 11:33:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-12-06 11:34:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you apologize? Or is that too much to expect?
2014-12-06 11:38:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm sorry I talked about things that upset you and didn't have the mindfulness to cut the conversation off.
2014-12-06 11:39:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can we ban talking about open relationships/polyamory until it's actually relevant (if it ever even becomes so)?
2014-12-06 11:40:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't think it's healthy for our current relationship 
2014-12-06 11:41:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we are in an open relationship as far as I'm concerned.
2014-12-06 11:41:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought that was what we established before.
2014-12-06 11:42:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Last night I was just trying to clarify what information we should each be expected to divulge.
2014-12-06 11:42:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And when.
2014-12-06 11:43:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes, we have said we won't break up with the other person if they hook up with someone else 
2014-12-06 11:43:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But neither of us are planning on doing that right now 
2014-12-06 11:43:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I've definitely told you that if that changes for me I will let you know 
2014-12-06 11:44:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]However, you continue to "disbelieve" me 
2014-12-06 11:44:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really need to know if you "plan" on doing it or not.
2014-12-06 11:44:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That makes it sound like you're going to actively start seeking out guys I guess.
2014-12-06 11:45:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And I don't really care if you're actively seeking them out or not, I want to know if you're about to sleep with another guy.
2014-12-06 11:45:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really care how you get in that situation, whether it was active or passive.
2014-12-06 11:45:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If any other guy asked me to go home with him, I will say no 
2014-12-06 11:45:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do not want to have sex with anyone else right now 
2014-12-06 11:46:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you want to have sex with someone else right now? 
2014-12-06 11:47:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]If there's no negative consequences, then I wouldn't be opposed to it.
2014-12-06 11:47:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok
2014-12-06 11:48:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I want you to stop disbelieving me when I tell you I do not want to have sex with anyone right now 
2014-12-06 11:48:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not because there might be consequences 
2014-12-06 11:48:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's because I don't want to 
2014-12-06 11:49:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you think you will never want to have sex with someone else?
2014-12-06 11:49:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've told you this so many times!
2014-12-06 11:50:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I do not know. I should not be expected to know how I will feel over the course of the rest of my life 
2014-12-06 11:51:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And your actions now should not be predicated on what might or might not happen 
2014-12-06 11:52:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess "I don't know" is kind of a frustrating answer
2014-12-06 11:52:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could probably put a probability on it
2014-12-06 11:52:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess I don't know is essentially 0.5?
2014-12-06 11:52:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No I can't 
2014-12-06 11:52:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so that's pretty satisfactory I'd say
2014-12-06 11:53:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]If I keep feeling that way I do now with you, it will be never 
2014-12-06 11:53:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd like that to be the case 
2014-12-06 11:54:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But we've established early on that we are willing to actively work on our relationship as it grows and changes 
2014-12-06 11:55:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which means that WHEN something comes up and feelings between us change (not even necessarily in a bad way), that we will feel comfortable talking to each other about it 
2014-12-06 11:56:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I will not talk about the probability of my future feelings. I prefer to make my relationship with you NOW as good as it can be 
2014-12-06 11:56:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And that means, no more talking about this until it is relevant 
2014-12-06 11:58:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Deal?
2014-12-06 11:59:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep.
2014-12-06 11:59:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No open relationship talk.
2014-12-06 11:59:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No past relationship talk.
2014-12-06 12:02:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good
2014-12-06 12:04:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love you 
2014-12-06 12:05:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you too.
2014-12-06 12:06:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I did jinx it the other day 
2014-12-06 12:32:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you have a Hangouts window open on your computer with text in it or something?
2014-12-06 12:39:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know 
2014-12-06 12:39:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It looks like you're constantly typing.
2014-12-06 12:41:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And it looks like you've read every message I sent.
2014-12-06 12:43:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Maybe, I'm not by my computer though 
2014-12-06 12:43:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I went to original pancake house 
2014-12-06 14:51:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]does it still say I'm typing?
2014-12-06 14:51:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yes
2014-12-06 14:52:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But only on my computers.
2014-12-06 14:52:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My phone doesn't show you typing.
2014-12-06 14:52:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]weird
2014-12-06 14:52:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, it's pretty annoying.
2014-12-06 14:53:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's a goofy thing to be annoyed about
2014-12-06 14:54:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it removes any "real-time" aspect
2014-12-06 14:55:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's just like regular texting now
2014-12-06 14:55:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess
2014-12-06 14:55:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know when you've actually read a message and I don't know when you're actually sending something.
2014-12-06 14:55:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]well I'll restart the browser and see if it's better
2014-12-06 14:56:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it's anything on your end.
2014-12-06 14:56:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because it's not doing it on my phone.
2014-12-06 14:56:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's been doing it since last night, though.
2014-12-06 14:56:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]are you going to meet up with Carl tonight?
2014-12-06 14:56:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think so.
2014-12-06 14:57:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that's a bummer
2014-12-06 14:58:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you have any text in the tablet app?
2014-12-06 14:58:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what were you talking to me on last night?
2014-12-06 14:58:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]my phone and my computer
2014-12-06 14:59:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]did you restart your browser?
2014-12-06 14:59:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it stopped
2014-12-06 14:59:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]did you do something?
2014-12-06 14:59:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP].... I did have text in the tablet lol
2014-12-06 14:59:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but I didn't use it since yesterday morninh
2014-12-06 15:00:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]weird
2014-12-06 15:00:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]my bad
2014-12-06 15:00:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess we didn't really talk yesterday.
2014-12-06 15:00:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Which is why I didn't notice it until last night.
2014-12-06 15:01:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss you
2014-12-06 15:03:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm still kinda bitter about you threatening to break up with me.
2014-12-06 15:06:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a shitty thing to do, I'm sorry
2014-12-06 15:09:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What would you like me to do when you're upsetting me?
2014-12-06 15:09:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess I forgot to use the safe word
2014-12-06 15:10:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Should I just end the conversation completely?
2014-12-06 15:11:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]telling me I'm making you upset works.
2014-12-06 15:11:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]it didn't really last night
2014-12-06 15:12:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]except I was ready to backoff
2014-12-06 15:12:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you continued escalating it yourself.
2014-12-06 15:12:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]when did you back off?
2014-12-06 15:12:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]go to 12:52
2014-12-06 15:12:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and read it from there
2014-12-06 15:14:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I should've explained to you then why you were upsetting me?
2014-12-06 15:14:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you could've either explained
2014-12-06 15:14:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or say I don't want to explain it right now
2014-12-06 15:14:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because I'm really upset
2014-12-06 15:15:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but you escalated it instead
2014-12-06 15:15:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I said that at 12:55p
2014-12-06 15:15:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]that I wanted to talk to you tomorrow about it
2014-12-06 15:16:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and then I called you a jerk because I felt like you were
2014-12-06 15:16:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and then you kept asking me about things
2014-12-06 15:17:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you asked me things
2014-12-06 15:17:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I said I want to talk about it tomorrow, and you did not stop
2014-12-06 15:18:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]dude I'm not being a jerk I'm genuinely curious about these things you've had a lot more varied sexual experience than I have and it intrigues me especially when you fuck two guys within a week of each other that you were sort of emotionally involved with that's pretty interesting
2014-12-06 15:18:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess the "you don't like talking about your sexual history I guess" message was one too many
2014-12-06 15:19:49[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not as simples as "I don't like talking about my history"
2014-12-06 15:20:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You made me being upset over something just a problem of mine
2014-12-06 15:20:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]whatever
2014-12-06 15:21:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]next time, I will tell you you're upsetting me and that I want to go to sleep and you will say ok
2014-12-06 15:22:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-12-06 15:22:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]so you don't miss me?

2014-12-08 18:06:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The question wasn't like anything we've gone over in class, in my opinion
2014-12-08 18:06:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and really isn't all that relevant to bioinformatics either
2014-12-08 18:06:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's fucked up

2014-12-08 18:30:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ummm depends, sometimes a promoter can get girls in for free, or else you buy a ticket 
2014-12-08 18:30:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And this group on campus sold discounted tickets with a bus ride occasionally too
2014-12-08 18:31:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice

2014-12-08 19:07:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]“A lot of these women are blonde, I assume,” said psychologist to the stars, Kevin Springfield. “And Leo has never won an Oscar. So he’s trying to replicate what he doesn’t have — a beautiful, gold statue — with the next best thing: women who look like beautiful, gold statues. But that’s not going to satisfy him.”
2014-12-08 19:07:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lololol

2014-12-08 20:04:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol you got a kick out of that, huh?
2014-12-08 20:05:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]should we have a Mexican night?
2014-12-08 20:06:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I've just never heard someone so strongly ask for rice 
2014-12-08 20:06:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes to mexican 
2014-12-08 20:06:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Enchiladas?

2014-12-08 20:09:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Obvs
2014-12-08 20:09:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That what started thinking about meals in the first place 
2014-12-08 20:10:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you have things in mind for that?
2014-12-08 20:10:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One of them is a surprise 
2014-12-08 20:11:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😀 
2014-12-08 20:14:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]studying for finals legitimately depresses me
2014-12-08 20:15:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wish I was there to make you smile 
2014-12-08 20:15:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]me too
2014-12-08 20:15:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I smiled from your message about baking me a surprise
2014-12-08 20:16:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Wooo hoop
2014-12-08 20:16:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm so excited to cook for you 
2014-12-08 20:17:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can tell
2014-12-08 20:17:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And for you to do the dishes :)
2014-12-08 20:17:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's pretty adorable
2014-12-08 20:17:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha gladly!
2014-12-08 20:17:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm excited to have you cook for me
2014-12-08 20:17:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and to do the dishes    😉 
2014-12-08 20:19:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what do couples do where neither person likes to cook?
2014-12-08 20:19:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe they don't exist
2014-12-08 20:19:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They eat out 
2014-12-08 20:19:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm sure they exist 
2014-12-08 20:19:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that'd be interesting to have some data on
2014-12-08 20:24:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I took a bunch of your gold medals on TwoDots
2014-12-08 20:24:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Those are fighting words, babe 
2014-12-08 20:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ohh, well let me rephrase that to say I'm whooping yo ass
2014-12-08 20:26:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you want me to sleep tonight??
2014-12-08 20:26:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-12-08 20:30:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I honestly don't really like the ice and fire levels, though
2014-12-08 20:31:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]a lot of them depend too much on luck
2014-12-08 20:34:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Kinda, yeah
2014-12-08 20:34:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But some skill too
2014-12-08 20:34:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially managing fire
2014-12-08 20:34:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm stuck on level 76
2014-12-08 20:34:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know what to do.
2014-12-08 20:35:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Complete a quest and get supply boxes
2014-12-08 20:35:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I mean I get that.
2014-12-08 20:35:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But that's bull shit.
2014-12-08 20:35:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That some levels are so stacked against you that they essentially require a supply box.
2014-12-08 20:36:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or you keep playing until you get the correct starting conditions
2014-12-08 20:37:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]again
2014-12-08 20:37:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's fucked up
2014-12-08 20:37:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it would be less fucked up if they let me buy the game
2014-12-08 20:37:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at one price
2014-12-08 20:37:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and play as much as I want
2014-12-08 20:38:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but they're clearly setting it up to get people to pay for a bunch of these micro-transactions
2014-12-08 20:38:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which is pretty shitty
2014-12-08 20:38:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Duh
2014-12-08 20:39:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But waiting 24 hours to do a quest is not terrible
2014-12-08 20:40:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I fucking hate level 76.
2014-12-08 20:40:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you like eggnog?
2014-12-08 20:41:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Uhh, I've probably only had it a couple of times in my life.
2014-12-08 20:41:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really remember.
2014-12-08 20:41:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I probably like it, though.
2014-12-08 20:45:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ughhh I just wish I could sit next to you on the couch while studying
2014-12-08 20:53:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me tooooo
2014-12-08 20:53:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I could use a nuzzle
2014-12-08 20:53:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I woke up at 6a today to write 
2014-12-08 20:53:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's early!
2014-12-08 20:54:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I find I write better right when I wake up 
2014-12-08 20:54:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]More focused 
2014-12-08 20:54:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll probably my do it tomorrow too 
2014-12-08 20:54:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]interesting
2014-12-08 20:55:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I definitely peak at nigh
2014-12-08 20:55:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]t
2014-12-08 21:02:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was complaining about how exams represent an extremely disproportioanl percentage of the final grade
2014-12-08 21:02:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I said all classes should be project based
2014-12-08 21:02:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you said chemistry should not
2014-12-08 21:03:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Intro to chemistry  should not 
2014-12-08 21:03:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]#pedantic
2014-12-08 21:04:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think I want to normalize our sentiment scores by length
2014-12-08 21:08:41[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Of the message?
2014-12-08 21:09:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-12-08 21:09:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think my use of haha is boosting my score probably
2014-12-08 21:09:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and probably my messaging style
2014-12-08 21:09:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Perhaps
2014-12-08 21:37:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Melinda boyfriend orders her Chinese take out while he's in Nola
2014-12-08 21:37:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like in Miami?
2014-12-08 21:38:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah
2014-12-08 21:38:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha that's funny
2014-12-08 21:42:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Why don't youuuu do that
2014-12-08 21:42:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha you'd want me to do that?
2014-12-08 21:42:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not even sure what that arrangement is.
2014-12-08 21:42:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]She tells him she wants Chinese takeout, and he orders it?
2014-12-08 21:43:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think he just did it when he knows she's had a long day 
2014-12-08 21:43:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And has it get to her apt at the same time she's done with work 
2014-12-08 21:43:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ah
2014-12-08 21:43:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and he picks out the food for her and stuff?
2014-12-08 21:44:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess 
2014-12-08 21:44:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]he probably knows what she likes 
2014-12-08 21:45:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-12-08 21:45:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that's gonna have to be another way I don't live up to your ideal
2014-12-08 21:45:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You won't surprise me with food after a long day?
2014-12-08 21:46:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how would I even know when you're having a long day
2014-12-08 21:46:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or when it is coming to an end?
2014-12-08 21:47:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I text you, "I'm having a long day" at some point and then text you when I'm on my way home?
2014-12-08 21:47:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it's ok, I was mostly joking 
2014-12-08 21:48:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see. So you would essentially be asking me to order your food for you.
2014-12-08 21:48:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, that's not the point of the surprise 
2014-12-08 21:48:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you don't ever text me when you're going home, though
2014-12-08 21:48:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know why you would do that
2014-12-08 21:49:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I probably will when we're living together 
2014-12-08 21:49:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't you think?
2014-12-08 21:49:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]well that's a different arrangement than what is being discussed
2014-12-08 21:50:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh, I was extending it to the future 
2014-12-08 21:50:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK.
2014-12-08 21:51:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]There probably have been times now though where I text you how hungry I am and I'm "just now leaving the museum"
2014-12-08 21:51:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I talk about being hungry a lot lol
2014-12-08 21:51:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you did this past week
2014-12-08 21:52:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you talked about being hungry
2014-12-08 21:52:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I think the only times you've ever texted me while you were going home was when it was from a social event
2014-12-08 21:52:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and kinda late
2014-12-08 21:53:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I mean I could order you food
2014-12-08 21:53:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'd ask you what you wanted
2014-12-08 21:53:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm not really interested in choosing your food for you
2014-12-08 21:53:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's romantic in an old school way for some reason
2014-12-08 21:53:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it doesn't interest me at all
2014-12-08 21:53:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol ok 
2014-12-08 21:54:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it's nice when someone gives you something that they know you'd like 
2014-12-08 21:54:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sorry
2014-12-08 21:54:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It feels personal 
2014-12-08 21:54:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But it's ok if it's not your thing 
2014-12-08 21:54:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]whatevs
2014-12-08 21:55:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Don't be cranky 
2014-12-08 21:55:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]too late
2014-12-08 21:56:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]👺👺👺👺👺

2014-12-09 09:11:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I love you so much. I don't deserve you.
2014-12-09 10:50:31[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes you dooo
2014-12-09 10:51:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, I have s confession: I got a free pizza by buying a $25 gift card. But I promise I didn't know that when I went to go buy one!
2014-12-09 10:51:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I figure we'll be sharing that pizza one day anyways :)
2014-12-09 10:51:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha I figured    😉 
2014-12-09 10:51:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I was like... damn $25 is a lot of pizza
2014-12-09 10:51:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then I went to their website
2014-12-09 10:51:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha
2014-12-09 10:52:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]A happy coincidence 
2014-12-09 10:52:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 
2014-12-09 10:52:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What time are your exams?
2014-12-09 10:52:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]1 and 4
2014-12-09 10:53:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do werk my man
2014-12-09 10:53:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll try my... I'll kinda try.
2014-12-09 10:54:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Lol
2014-12-09 17:59:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Does Snapchat flip my pictures?
2014-12-09 17:59:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It flips my videos.
2014-12-09 17:59:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or I don't know if Snapchat is doing it, or they just do the default of whatever the stock camera does.
2014-12-09 17:59:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And my stock camera flips the pic I think.
2014-12-09 18:40:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Umm I dunno 
2014-12-09 18:40:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Snap chat flips mine, right?
2014-12-09 18:51:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Well you're mirrored.
2014-12-09 18:52:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It looks like how it looks when you take it.
2014-12-09 18:52:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Whereas mine looks like a mirror image while I'm taking it, and then it flips it... the videos at least.
2014-12-09 18:52:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't think it flips the pictures.
2014-12-09 18:53:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Weird.
2014-12-09 18:53:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Because neither of yours get flipped.
2014-12-09 18:53:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The videos and pics are both mirrored.
2014-12-09 19:04:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your use of mirror and flipped are confusing me lol
2014-12-09 19:05:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]mirror is not reality
2014-12-09 19:05:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like what you see when you look in the mirror
2014-12-09 19:07:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can I post the gift card on Facebook or is the message too personal?
2014-12-09 19:08:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha no
2014-12-09 19:09:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I thought you were asking about the email 
2014-12-09 19:09:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Where o talk about you pooping
2014-12-09 19:09:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha
2014-12-09 19:10:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what were you saying "no" to?
2014-12-09 19:10:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh, no I don't mind if you post it
2014-12-09 19:10:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok

2014-12-09 19:45:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I've been eating pretty unhealthy lately 
2014-12-09 19:46:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hmm, I don't really know then. Pasta salad?
2014-12-09 19:48:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have some frozen ravioli but no sauce 
2014-12-09 19:48:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol y'all have a legit bachelorette fridge
2014-12-09 19:49:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It goes through phases 
2014-12-09 19:50:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're currently in a "haven't been grocery shopping in weeks" phase 
2014-12-09 19:50:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha nice
2014-12-09 20:18:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought that grant was really solid!
2014-12-09 20:19:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'd give you government money    😉 
2014-12-09 20:36:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No you wouldn't 
2014-12-09 20:36:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But thank you! 
2014-12-09 20:48:54[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I made a pretty tasty last minute meal 
2014-12-09 20:49:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP] Take that for bachlorette fridge!
2014-12-09 20:51:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha well done!
2014-12-09 20:51:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ughhhh we're so close
2014-12-09 20:54:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know. I want you now!
2014-12-09 20:54:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-12-09 20:54:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Me too
2014-12-09 20:55:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have a really long day tomorrow 
2014-12-09 20:55:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I want some stress relieving cuddles 
2014-12-09 20:55:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's on the agenda?
2014-12-09 20:55:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Aw. I wish I could provide them.
2014-12-09 20:56:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Finish up that grant completely and submit it, meet with the sequencing center dude at noon, then like 6 hours of lab work 
2014-12-09 20:56:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I feel bad since I haven't hung out with Haley in a while and I kinda blew her off last night, so I might hang out with her after 
2014-12-09 20:57:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word. That is a full day.
2014-12-09 20:57:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll cuddle you extra good when I get there.
2014-12-09 20:58:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That made me smile 
2014-12-09 20:58:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:)
2014-12-09 20:58:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kinda like when you squeeze me so hard I can't breathe sometimes 
2014-12-09 20:59:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Unless I actually can't breathe 
2014-12-09 20:59:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hahaha
2014-12-09 20:59:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I like giving you big squeezes too.
2014-12-09 21:00:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The Evil Within came!
2014-12-09 21:00:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It said it might be back ordered until January 
2014-12-09 21:00:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Sweeeet
2014-12-09 21:00:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Oh really? That's a nice surprise then.
2014-12-09 21:00:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I want to play it immediately 
2014-12-09 21:01:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Noooo
2014-12-09 21:01:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'll wait for youuu 
2014-12-09 21:01:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Also, Darcy and Colin are playing ps2
2014-12-09 21:01:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You better.
2014-12-09 21:01:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha really? What are they playing?
2014-12-09 21:01:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Monster Rancher 
2014-12-09 21:01:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They actually might be playing a ps1
2014-12-09 21:02:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know it.
2014-12-09 21:02:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It also means I can't use my vibrator :/
2014-12-09 21:03:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Are you too loud?
2014-12-09 21:03:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They would definitely hear the buzzing 
2014-12-09 21:03:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You think so?
2014-12-09 21:03:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause they're like right next to my door, and it's louder than you think 
2014-12-09 21:04:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You don't think the TV would drown it out?
2014-12-09 21:05:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They have the tv turned way down 
2014-12-09 21:05:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's like quiet little background music 
2014-12-09 21:05:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah I see. Well that's a bummer.
2014-12-09 21:06:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]How many times have you masturbated since we were apart?
2014-12-09 21:08:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]2x
2014-12-09 21:09:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's been a stressful week lol 
2014-12-09 21:09:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So is that a lot or a little?
2014-12-09 21:09:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Or average?
2014-12-09 21:10:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's a little more frequent than usual 
2014-12-09 21:10:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'd say 1 a week is a good average 
2014-12-09 21:10:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Always or while dating me?
2014-12-09 21:11:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not always 
2014-12-09 21:11:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I started masturbating more in general after I moved to Chicago 
2014-12-09 21:12:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I think I might masturbate a little more often since we've been dating  
2014-12-09 21:12:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why's that? Living on your own?
2014-12-09 21:12:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, sometimes boredom 
2014-12-09 21:13:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's interesting. That'd support the whole women's sex drives go up when they're having sex hypothesis.
2014-12-09 21:13:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah, I think that has something to do with it 
2014-12-09 21:13:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And we have sexual conversations that get me horny where I'd otherwise probably not be 
2014-12-09 21:13:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]The gift that keeps on giving.
2014-12-09 21:13:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha
2014-12-09 21:14:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]That's a good point.
2014-12-09 21:16:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're out of ice cream 
2014-12-09 21:17:20[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]No vibrator, no ice cream... what's the point of living?
2014-12-09 21:17:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'm actually eating the last of the ice cream 
2014-12-09 21:18:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just meant you won't have any while you're here ;)
2014-12-09 21:19:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Guess I'll just have to go for seconds on your pussy.
2014-12-09 21:19:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess that'd be ok
2014-12-09 21:22:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you think Charlotte would like National Geographic Kids? 
2014-12-09 21:23:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah. And I think Dylan and Emily would like that too.
2014-12-09 21:24:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I loved that shit as a kid 
2014-12-09 21:24:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Haha I bet. We should get it for her.
2014-12-09 21:25:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's also only $12, so we can get a real toy too 
2014-12-09 21:25:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Fo sho.
2014-12-09 21:26:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you want me to order it?
2014-12-09 21:26:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Or you know their address
2014-12-09 21:27:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah I can order it. This relationship keeps getting better and better :)
2014-12-09 21:27:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Haha what do you mean?
2014-12-09 21:28:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Helping me pick out Christmas presents!
2014-12-09 21:28:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:)
2014-12-09 21:29:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You have to tell everyone it was my idea though 
2014-12-09 21:29:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I will, if it's not already obvious!
2014-12-09 21:30:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I should get the print/digital subscription yeah?
2014-12-09 21:30:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think having a print version would make her more likely to read it.
2014-12-09 21:30:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah the print 
2014-12-09 21:30:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]For sure
2014-12-09 21:31:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's always exciting getting magazines in the mail too!
2014-12-09 21:31:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes we're on the exact same brainwave I swear 
2014-12-09 21:31:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]😘 😘 😘 😘    
2014-12-09 21:32:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I want to move in with you nowww
2014-12-09 21:33:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I realized today that in October we finally had less time ahead of us than the length of our relationship 
2014-12-09 21:34:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]So we were like half way to moving in together since the start of our relationship?
2014-12-09 21:35:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well in Sept, we had been together 6 months but still had 8 months until we were in the same place 
2014-12-09 21:36:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Which sounds a little ridiculous 
2014-12-09 21:36:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha no doubt
2014-12-09 21:36:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]definitely an unconventional start
2014-12-09 21:37:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when did we first talk about moving in together?
2014-12-09 21:37:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Raleigh 
2014-12-09 21:39:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You mentioned you wanted to work for red hat  and I got cranky because I thought it meant you weren't planning on trying to come to Chicago 
2014-12-09 21:39:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah I remember being a little surprised about that
2014-12-09 21:42:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We're crazy 
2014-12-09 21:42:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha absolutely... luckily, we seem to be equally crazy.
2014-12-09 21:42:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's insane luck
2014-12-09 21:43:13[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]can you imagine if one of us felt the way we do and the other one wasn't on board?
2014-12-09 21:43:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wonder if one of us would have even fell in love as quickly if the other person wasn't on board?
2014-12-09 21:43:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think we were picking up on those vibes from each other early on.
2014-12-09 21:44:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]True
2014-12-09 21:46:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Have you ever played pit droids?
2014-12-09 21:46:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nope
2014-12-09 21:47:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I have it on my iPad, I think you'd like it 
2014-12-09 21:47:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've almost caught up to you on Twodots
2014-12-09 21:48:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice puzzle game 
2014-12-09 21:48:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]100 is fucking hard 
2014-12-09 21:48:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm on 96, so I should be there before long.
2014-12-09 21:51:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's crazy to think about where I was last December, where I am this December, and where I might be next December
2014-12-09 21:52:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some big changes 
2014-12-09 21:52:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]for sure
2014-12-09 21:52:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I saw my age on something today and it felt so weird seeing that I am 27.
2014-12-09 21:58:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]My mom said "That was really sweet of Katherine"
2014-12-09 21:58:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and then said "Every time you talk about her, this is what I hear in my brain  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8V8tMK68M7U "
2014-12-09 22:00:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Hahahaha 
2014-12-09 22:00:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I love that you talk about me that way!!
2014-12-09 22:01:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha good!
2014-12-09 22:01:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I miss staring into your eyes 
2014-12-09 22:02:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-12-09 22:03:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]It's so funny how one of the first things I noticed about you was your eye contact and how you said you hated making eye contact.
2014-12-09 22:03:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I think you've said that exact sentence to me before 
2014-12-09 22:03:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha yeah?
2014-12-09 22:04:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I know I've mentioned the eye contact thing.
2014-12-09 22:04:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, we talked about it on April 2nd.
2014-12-09 22:05:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]But it wasn't that exact sentence because I didn't know you didn't like eye contact before that convo.
2014-12-09 22:05:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess you said you "avoid" eye contact
2014-12-09 22:05:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]not that you dislike it
2014-12-09 22:07:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dunno, I feel like it's too intense with some ppl 
2014-12-09 22:07:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And j feel awkward 
2014-12-09 22:08:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]makes sense, it just surprised me at the time because I found your eye contact notable
2014-12-09 22:09:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]More reason for me to avoid it with other ppl! 
2014-12-09 22:10:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I liked it, but I guess I was attracted to you.
2014-12-09 22:28:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was my spandex shorts 
2014-12-09 22:28:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We have them to thank for our relationship 
2014-12-09 22:28:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I totally thought you were some goober science girl actually
2014-12-09 22:38:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because of my shorts?
2014-12-09 22:38:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-12-09 22:38:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I forgot my bathing suit bottoms!!
2014-12-09 22:39:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well I didn't know that at the time
2014-12-09 22:40:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I actually remember thinking, it'll only be girls and Aaron and some SICB people so I didnt need to look sexy 
2014-12-09 22:41:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well I guess you weren't wrong!
2014-12-09 22:43:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I wasn't expecting to meet the love of my life right then 
2014-12-09 22:44:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I approved of #datass anyway
2014-12-10 08:27:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should go to Palau for our honeymoon 
2014-12-10 08:28:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]One of my good friends from undergrad is a dive master there 
2014-12-10 08:28:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And his pictures look awesome 
2014-12-10 08:29:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sounds good
2014-12-10 08:29:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What are you doing up so early?
2014-12-10 08:30:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You should be relaxing after all your hard work!
2014-12-10 08:30:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I woke up at like 5:30
2014-12-10 08:32:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Silly

2014-12-10 08:36:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And accidentally played until 1
2014-12-10 08:36:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your family lovessss me

2014-12-10 11:44:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Looks like it'll be in the 70s for part of the time we're in Florida 
2014-12-10 11:44:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sweet

2014-12-10 12:27:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you'll have to turn your volume up
2014-12-10 12:27:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but, multiple times a day,
2014-12-10 12:27:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he goes into his room and I'm assuming his bathroom
2014-12-10 12:27:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and spend like five minutes
2014-12-10 12:27:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hocking loogies
2014-12-10 12:28:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it's super fucking loud
2014-12-10 12:28:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and drives me absolutely crazy
2014-12-10 12:28:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]he also talks to his dog really loudly and obnoxiously
2014-12-10 12:28:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and does this stupid ass guffaw
2014-12-10 12:28:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'll try and record that next time he does it too
2014-12-10 12:29:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so not only is the "hocking" part ridiculously loud
2014-12-10 12:29:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but he makes a really loud spit noise
2014-12-10 12:29:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like a patooie sound
2014-12-10 12:29:51[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like when you're trying to make a noise spitting
2014-12-10 12:44:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]That's disgusting 
2014-12-10 12:44:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it's nice he goes to his room to do it?
2014-12-10 12:44:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I'm assuming he thinks he's being courteous
2014-12-10 12:44:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but it's still pretty obnoxious
2014-12-10 12:51:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I dropped things no less than 4 times during my meeting with the seq guy today 
2014-12-10 12:52:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hahaha spreading DNA all over the place?
2014-12-10 12:52:25[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm pretty sure that's how you get teenage mutant ninja turtles
2014-12-10 14:15:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MC3XuMvsDI
2014-12-10 14:15:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Definitely wanna see this.

2014-12-10 16:07:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not DNA, my phone/wallet/papers
2014-12-10 16:08:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh well that's not as embarassing
2014-12-10 16:10:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It was at the time 
2014-12-10 16:10:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm not sure how I feel about that trailer 
2014-12-10 16:10:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]too stereotypical for your taste I imagine
2014-12-10 16:11:05[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a little too "traditional gender role" heavy 
2014-12-10 16:11:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-12-10 16:11:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But seems cute
2014-12-10 16:12:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]sooo I mean isn't that sort of thing relatable, though?
2014-12-10 16:12:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what if it said "based on a true story"
2014-12-10 16:13:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So we should tell young boys that they're expected to be clueless parents? 
2014-12-10 16:13:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Is that how you're going to be at the dinner table?
2014-12-10 16:13:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]is the purpose of entertainment to push an agenda?
2014-12-10 16:13:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does everything have to push an agenda?
2014-12-10 16:14:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]does everything have to be teaching a lesson?
2014-12-10 16:14:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Everything does teach a lesson though 
2014-12-10 16:14:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Especially children's stuff
2014-12-10 16:15:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]They're little sponges, and here's a movie showing what goes on in other ppls brains 
2014-12-10 16:15:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so there can never exist a dynamic in a movie where the dad maybe doesn't pay attention to all the details and is the disciplinarian of the family... even though every kid I grew up with had EXACTLY that arrangement
2014-12-10 16:16:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My dad was not the disciplinarian 
2014-12-10 16:16:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we didn't have similar upbringings
2014-12-10 16:16:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nor did our friends
2014-12-10 16:17:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]This is a movie for children, not for us 
2014-12-10 16:17:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so kids can't relate to a disciplinarian father figure?
2014-12-10 16:18:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you back off on me about this, I'm having a long day. We can talk about it another time 
2014-12-10 16:19:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What's a MIL?
2014-12-10 16:21:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Oh, mother in law 
2014-12-10 17:55:04[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I didn't mean for you to stop talking to me
2014-12-10 17:55:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok.
2014-12-10 17:56:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]What's up then?
2014-12-10 17:56:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm about to go to the museum 
2014-12-10 17:57:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]to work?
2014-12-10 17:57:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah 
2014-12-10 17:57:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]gonna be a late night?
2014-12-10 17:58:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably 
2014-12-10 17:58:18[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you check in to your flight?
2014-12-10 17:58:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yep
2014-12-10 17:58:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]B35
2014-12-10 17:58:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Nice
2014-12-10 18:00:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I washed my jeans too
2014-12-10 18:00:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they don't smell like cat litter box anymore
2014-12-10 18:00:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You didn't set them though, right?
2014-12-10 18:01:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you mean dry?
2014-12-10 18:01:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and yes I did.
2014-12-10 18:01:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Put them in the dryer 
2014-12-10 18:01:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You're not supposed to, but if they still fit then it's fine 
2014-12-10 18:36:08[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Darcy hadn't done a dish in like 2 weeks 
2014-12-10 18:36:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And has had lots of ppl over
2014-12-10 18:36:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Dishes literally take 15 min tops
2014-12-10 18:36:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😕 
2014-12-10 18:36:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe you could just ask her?
2014-12-10 18:36:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]like real chill?
2014-12-10 18:37:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She always comes in and apologizes and promises she'll do them the next day
2014-12-10 18:38:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]when you ask her to do them?
2014-12-10 18:38:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]No, every time she comes home 
2014-12-10 18:38:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]She apologizes for the dishes and then doesn't do them 
2014-12-10 18:38:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So I do them 
2014-12-10 18:38:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe asking her to do them would put some urgency on it?
2014-12-10 18:39:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't mind that much 90% of the time 
2014-12-10 18:39:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Cause I never take out the trash 
2014-12-10 18:39:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]*almost never 
2014-12-10 18:39:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]So it's a fair trade 
2014-12-10 18:39:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I see.
2014-12-10 18:39:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just don't like doing her friend's dirty dishes 
2014-12-10 18:40:13[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm irritable right now lol 
2014-12-10 18:40:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha I couldn't tell!
2014-12-10 18:41:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I really think you should just ask.
2014-12-10 18:41:36[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you can even use me as an excuse if you want
2014-12-10 18:41:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're super excited to never have to take out the trash and do the dishes when we live together aren't you?
2014-12-10 18:42:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll do the dishes sometimes 
2014-12-10 18:42:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I kinda like doing them as long as they don't have gross food on them 
2014-12-10 18:43:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's a task that's very easily accomplished 
2014-12-10 18:43:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]true
2014-12-10 18:43:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]The trash thing is so true though 
2014-12-10 18:44:24[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]that task is pretty easily accomplished too
2014-12-10 18:44:42[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It makes me vomit in my mouth though 
2014-12-10 18:44:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Literally

2014-12-10 19:01:52[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]this is probably the longest time I've ever gone without going to Disney World
2014-12-10 19:02:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]seven years I guess
2014-12-10 19:02:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You've been to Disney land though 
2014-12-10 19:02:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's been 16 
2014-12-10 19:02:38[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they're not the same, Katherine!
2014-12-10 19:02:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Not including the Disney Half marathon 
2014-12-10 19:07:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ugh, i just want it to be tomorrow evening
2014-12-10 19:16:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Truth 
2014-12-10 19:21:10[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I decided to not go to the museum 
2014-12-10 19:21:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll have to get there at 8a, but I can still get the same amount done before I go pick you up 
2014-12-10 19:21:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-12-10 19:22:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I wanted to clean and get ready for you anyways 
2014-12-10 19:22:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so you're cleaning tonight instead?
2014-12-10 19:22:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'll probably still go to Simons for AHS around 8:30/9
2014-12-10 19:23:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]But I'm doing dishes and cleaning the apt now 
2014-12-10 19:23:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh ok
2014-12-10 19:24:28[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do y'all like talk about the show as it's happening?
2014-12-10 19:24:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or do you just sit there?
2014-12-10 19:24:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I've never done group show watching
2014-12-10 19:26:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We might talk a little about it during the commercials, and we just hang out before 
2014-12-10 19:26:55[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's like a nice social thing to look forward to
2014-12-10 19:27:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's why I was asking if you talk during the show
2014-12-10 19:27:47[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]because if you just sat there in silence it wouldn't seem all that social
2014-12-10 19:27:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I guess if you're hanging out before and after
2014-12-10 19:28:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do y'all usually get stoned for it
2014-12-10 19:28:15[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Sometimes 
2014-12-10 19:28:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Probably 70% of the time 
2014-12-10 19:28:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha ahhh
2014-12-10 19:28:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I mean I've watched regular shows with people without smoking 
2014-12-10 19:29:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Some friends and I would watch Vampire Diaries together every week in college 
2014-12-10 19:29:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]do you have some weed?
2014-12-10 19:29:38[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Right now?

2014-12-10 19:34:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You didn't make it sound like you liked it very much from our last conversation 
2014-12-10 19:35:30[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't really like that it dumbs me down
2014-12-10 19:35:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or that it it's used to fight boredom
2014-12-10 19:36:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but that's an issue I'm gonna get over
2014-12-10 19:36:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it can be something I participate in with you
2014-12-10 19:38:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we should pick up some other drugs too

2014-12-10 19:44:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I guess your coke contact isn't actually a coke contact, right?
2014-12-10 19:44:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and you didn't end up getting shrooms?
2014-12-10 19:46:30[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yeah every coke deal I tried fell through 
2014-12-10 19:46:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can get shrooms if you want 
2014-12-10 19:46:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You just didn't seem enthused 
2014-12-10 19:46:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nah I'm down
2014-12-10 19:47:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]kinda sucks about the coke

2014-12-10 19:49:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]His contact had a big order and he asked if I wanted before the holiday

2014-12-10 19:50:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And apparently half might be good enough for 1 night for me 
2014-12-10 19:51:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]word
2014-12-10 23:43:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm home

2014-12-11 10:43:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]drank my juice out of the jug this morning... aren't you proud?
2014-12-11 10:44:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I don't know how many bags you have, but probably 
2014-12-11 10:44:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm bringing my laptop backpack, my Nike duffle bag, and a suitcase.
2014-12-11 10:44:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I'm very proud 
2014-12-11 13:23:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Your Bath & Body Works stuff got confiscated.
2014-12-11 13:33:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you leave them in your carryon?
2014-12-11 13:33:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-12-11 13:33:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]:(((((
2014-12-11 13:34:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess one of them was free after all 
2014-12-11 13:34:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Why'd you buy that stuff in Texas anyway?
2014-12-11 13:35:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Because my mom had those coupons and we were right next to a bath and body works 
2014-12-11 13:35:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And you were flying SWA a week later
2014-12-11 13:39:06[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not a big deal though 
2014-12-11 13:42:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Delayed 20 minutes.
2014-12-11 13:45:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I can't wait to see you! Lab work is going by so slow today 
2014-12-11 13:46:26[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Ok, I'll keep an eye on your flight 
2014-12-11 13:52:37[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I can't wait to see you too!
2014-12-11 13:53:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]And thanks for the titty snap this morning... you're sexy as fuck!
2014-12-11 13:55:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I was getting a little hurt you hadn't commented on it 
2014-12-11 14:48:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]We're heading out. See you in a couple of hours!
2014-12-11 14:49:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]!!!!
2014-12-11 15:10:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK NOW we're actually leaving. Had to wait on some bags apparently.

2014-12-14 09:46:43[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK. And it's definitely at 2?
2014-12-14 09:47:12[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes 
2014-12-14 09:47:26[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Word.

2014-12-14 09:49:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I don't know if I'm really that type of person.
2014-12-14 09:50:14[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You don't read?
2014-12-14 09:51:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Not books very often. It took me like six months to finish Lolita remember?
2014-12-14 09:51:57[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well what about something to read while you go on your little weekend trips?
2014-12-14 09:53:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Hmm let me see.
2014-12-14 09:56:22[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]What was the philosophy and stats  book  ppl were talking about yesterday? Does that interest you?
2014-12-14 09:59:10[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Um I don't know what it was. Laura said they read something like that for EvProcesses last year, but I don't really know what it's about.
2014-12-14 12:50:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Did you find a book?
2014-12-14 12:50:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nooo
2014-12-14 12:51:20[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Your mother wants to know 
2014-12-14 12:51:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And I don't want to ignore her question lol
2014-12-14 12:52:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]books aren't ever something I want
2014-12-14 12:53:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I really don't know
2014-12-14 12:53:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you pick something out for me
2014-12-14 12:53:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Do you want another magazine subscription?
2014-12-14 12:54:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe
2014-12-14 12:55:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]maybe Popular Science?
2014-12-14 14:27:53[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Only Kat and Michael were there so we just canceled it.
2014-12-14 14:28:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm parked on 52nd by your apartment.
2014-12-14 14:40:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm home 
2014-12-14 14:40:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm calling you 
2014-12-15 09:35:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I left my lunch on the counter, can you put it away in the fridge for me?
2014-12-15 09:49:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-12-15 11:20:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Coming home for lunch
2014-12-15 11:20:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yay!
2014-12-15 12:48:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Paid for the metra and missed it by 1 sec
2014-12-15 12:53:09[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]:(((
2014-12-15 12:53:19[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Do you want a ride?
2014-12-15 13:18:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]My phone died of course 
2014-12-15 13:18:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I just got here
2014-12-15 13:18:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Thanks though 
2014-12-15 13:19:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]no problem. I hope things start going your way.
2014-12-15 14:05:17[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It's not looking good. I got all excited because the primers I ordered to arrive today were on my lab bench...only to find out they were someone else's.
2014-12-15 14:05:43[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Good news is I'll definitely be home early, because I won't have anything else to do!
2014-12-15 14:06:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]haha well that's a nice consolation prize I suppose
2014-12-15 14:06:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I'm sorry about the primers
2014-12-15 14:06:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Depending on when they get here, I'll have to work until midnight tomorrow most likely 
2014-12-15 14:07:23[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]aw, man. That's rough.
2014-12-15 14:07:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I wish I could help you out!
2014-12-15 14:08:56[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]It makes it way better that I get to come home grumpy to you 
2014-12-15 14:09:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP] 😃 
2014-12-15 17:12:33[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Can you come pick me up by the west entrance?
2014-12-15 17:12:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah.
2014-12-15 17:13:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]You have your apartment keys, right?
2014-12-15 17:13:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Yes
2014-12-15 17:13:50[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]You know how to get to the west entrance? 
2014-12-15 17:13:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK
2014-12-15 17:14:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Uhh it's off of LSD, right?
2014-12-15 17:14:23[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I parked in front of the frank loyd right house 
2014-12-15 17:14:37[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Turn right on McFetridge 
2014-12-15 17:14:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Off of lake shore 
2014-12-15 17:14:53[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]And it's on your left
2014-12-15 17:15:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]OK.
2014-12-15 17:26:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Text me when your outside the gate 
2014-12-15 17:33:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm parked by the light post near the gate. The security guard let me sit here.
2014-12-16 12:28:11[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]primers aren't in yet so I'm working on bioinformatics
2014-12-16 12:28:24[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]the "break" in my profile maker was also an issue
2014-12-16 12:28:40[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so it's fixed?
2014-12-16 12:28:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]yeah
2014-12-16 12:28:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]nice
2014-12-16 12:29:02[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]no points though    😞 
2014-12-16 12:29:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah, I think you might be late for the next chapter too.
2014-12-16 12:29:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]not that it matters I guess
2014-12-16 12:29:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I'm late for full points, but can get half points if I finish by 1/5
2014-12-16 12:29:42[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh OK
2014-12-16 12:30:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah the points don't really mean anything to you
2014-12-16 12:31:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]you're already doing this stuff for a living
2014-12-16 12:31:19[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess it could one day have been something to bring up in an interview for a job
2014-12-16 12:31:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think it would've been more valuable to you as an undergrad
2014-12-16 12:31:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]but if I really care about that I'll just retake it next year and get a 100%
2014-12-16 12:31:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]applying for PhD programs
2014-12-16 12:31:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]truth
2014-12-16 12:32:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]apparently Key West is a place for weirdos
2014-12-16 12:33:07[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]which would explain the cheap(er) real estate
2014-12-16 12:33:27[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]oh yeah, it's hippie central
2014-12-16 12:33:39[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]like weird old people hippies that go to burning man
2014-12-16 12:33:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]they aren't really hippies, though
2014-12-16 12:34:05[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it's more like... just not give a fuckery
2014-12-16 12:34:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]counterculture
2014-12-16 12:34:31[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]hippies have some ethics I feel like
2014-12-16 12:34:36[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]anti-establishment in the most passive of senses
2014-12-16 12:34:44[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and the Key West ethic seems to be debauchery
2014-12-16 12:34:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]not all hippies
2014-12-16 12:34:58[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]if you're a hippie
2014-12-16 12:35:01[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]debauchery can be ethical
2014-12-16 12:35:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]self-described
2014-12-16 12:35:09[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]just not particularly moral
2014-12-16 12:35:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]same difference
2014-12-16 13:03:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Amazon says one of the things I ordered for you was delivered on Sunday?
2014-12-16 13:04:35[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe it's in the mailbox?
2014-12-16 13:04:51[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]when did you order it?
2014-12-16 13:05:03[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the 12th
2014-12-16 13:05:14[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]it says it was delivered Sunday at 12:29 PM
2014-12-16 13:05:46[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]maybe they left an attempted delivery note
2014-12-16 13:06:00[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]how big is it supposed to be?
2014-12-16 13:06:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]FUCK
2014-12-16 13:06:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I shipped it to the wrong address
2014-12-16 13:06:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]where'd you ship it?
2014-12-16 13:06:35[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]along with all those other presents
2014-12-16 13:06:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]4710
2014-12-16 13:07:03[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]4710 Woodlawn?
2014-12-16 13:07:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-12-16 13:07:50[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what the fuck
2014-12-16 13:07:54[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how did that even happen
2014-12-16 13:08:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I guess we can go knock on their door and ask for the presents lol
2014-12-16 13:08:59[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]have they all been delivered? You might be able to call UPS or do something through amazon to change the address for the ones that haven't been delivered yet
2014-12-16 13:10:49[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]how the fuck did that even happen
2014-12-16 13:10:59[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I think the corrected the address and I didn't realize they fucked it up
2014-12-16 13:11:55[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]your other present is going to the right place
2014-12-16 13:12:02[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what should we do about the other one?
2014-12-16 13:13:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]did you put a unit #?
2014-12-16 13:13:48[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]yeah
2014-12-16 13:14:22[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]isn't it illegal to accept mail that's not for you?
2014-12-16 13:14:34[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]probably
2014-12-16 13:15:07[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]We should go there and ring the doorbell and leave a note asking them to call us
2014-12-16 13:15:21[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]ok
2014-12-16 13:15:45[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]and if we don't hear back in a day or 2, report it on amazon
2014-12-16 13:15:58[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i'm sure this shit happens, they'll send another one
2014-12-16 13:16:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i shouldve left you my keys so you can make copies
2014-12-16 13:17:00[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]man, good thing I checked that, because all those presents were being shipped to that same address.
2014-12-16 13:17:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess that's the risk with being in two different places I don't know the actual address of for Christams
2014-12-16 13:17:45[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and ordering things online
2014-12-16 13:17:52[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]you could've asked meee
2014-12-16 13:18:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I have your address saved
2014-12-16 13:18:08[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and I typed it in
2014-12-16 13:18:18[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]and it was correct on your other present
2014-12-16 13:18:32[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]but I obviously didn't notice they fucked it up when they "corrected" it
2014-12-16 13:18:46[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I thought they were just adding the last bit to the zip code
2014-12-16 13:20:41[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]the units at 4701 are labeled by letters?
2014-12-16 13:20:56[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]so I'm not really sure how they delivered it
2014-12-16 13:21:04[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]unless they assumed B = 2?
2014-12-16 13:21:16[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]was it ups or usps?
2014-12-16 13:21:27[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]oh it's 4710
2014-12-16 13:21:29[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]they probably just left it honestly
2014-12-16 13:21:29[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]fuck this is confusing
2014-12-16 13:21:48[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]i love you
2014-12-16 13:22:01[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Yeah, I guess they might've just left it.
2014-12-16 13:22:12[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]at like a central package pickup place
2014-12-16 13:22:39[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]we'll go ring their doorbell I guess
2014-12-16 13:22:57[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]or I guess I can just order it again
2014-12-16 13:24:11[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I'm up to like $400 in the past several days
2014-12-16 13:24:15[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]what's another $25
2014-12-16 13:24:16[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]lol
2014-12-16 13:24:21[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]noooooo
2014-12-16 13:24:25[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]we'll go look for it
2014-12-16 13:24:40[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or you tell whoever delivered it that you put the wrong address in
2014-12-16 13:24:44[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]or tell amazon

2014-12-17 15:57:32[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Very strange characters in your text 
2014-12-17 15:58:33[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Ah. Yeah it didn't send at first because it was trying to connect to the UChicago WiFi.
2014-12-17 15:59:17[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Wasn't connected to the 4G you know?
2014-12-17 15:59:28[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]I hear that

2014-12-17 16:08:34[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]I guess I can keep working. Hopefully that guy will call me when he gets home and I can pick up that package.
2014-12-17 16:11:47[SEP]Katie Silliman[SEP]Well I'm mostly sitting around waiting for machines, so if you want to come hang in the basement of zoology after you pick the package up lemme know 
2014-12-17 16:13:06[SEP]Michael A. Alcorn[SEP]Alright. I'll probably do that if he calls early enough.
